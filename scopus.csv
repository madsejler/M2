The industry and academia have joined hands to develop technologies for the anticipated future wireless communication. The predicted Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and use cases for the 6G networks have raised the bar high. 6G networks are developing to provide the required infrastructure for many new devices and services. The 6G networks are conceptualized to partially inherit 5G technologies and standards but they will open the ground for innovations. This study provides the vision and requirements for beyond 5G (B5G) networks and emphasizes our vision on the required standards to reach a fully functional and interoperable 6G era in general. We highlight various KPIs and enabling technologies for the B5G networks.

ReA usually occurs in the lower limbs causing joint pain and joint swelling. Physiotherapy-led exercise is recommended to prevent muscle atrophy. The purpose of this case report is to describe the outcome after 12 weeks of low-load blood flow restricted resistance training (BFR-RT) as a rehabilitation method for a young male suffering from ReA. Methods and materials: A 17-year-old male suffered from ReA in the both knee joints and the left hip joint. 36 months after the incident, he suffered from another ReA incident in his right knee. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and a new arthrocentesis added with corticosteroid injection was unsuccessful in treating the ReA. The patient performed 12 weeks of BFR-RT on the right lower limb with a low amount of supervision after the first week of training. Assessment of unilateral 30-sec chair stand test (u30-sec CST), low-thigh circumference above apex patella, The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), The Forgotten Knee Joint Score (FJS), and Numeric Ranking Scale for pain (NRS) was performed at baseline and after 3,6,9, and 12 weeks of BFR-RT. Results: The patient completed all planned exercise sessions. u30-sec CST improved with 7 repetitions (reps) on the right limb and 5 reps on the left leg. Low-thigh circumference decreased 1.1 cm on the right leg and 1.0 on the left leg. KOOS symptoms, ADL, quality of life and FJS demonstrated a clinically relevant change on 10, 14 and 23 points. Conclusion: The present case study indicates that even with low amounts of supervision BFR-RT could increase functional performance, reduce knee joint swelling and improve key patient-reported outcome.

However they are far from constituting the industrial practice. One primary cause for this is the severe time consumption they entail, especially in acquiring the necessary process data. A recently developed method, the Required Data Reduction Analysis (RDRA), aims at reducing this time consumption. It makes use of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques, together with optimisation tools, in order to systematically identify: (i) a reduced number of process parameters, whose information need to be acquired with high detail, and (ii) the maximum acceptable uncertainty of each of them. The paper presents recent additions to the method, expanding its capabilities and addressing two open questions highlighted in previous work. In particular: (i) three sensitivity analysis techniques are compared, based on computational effort and precision, (ii) a novel algorithm for minimising the number of parameters needing detailed data acquisition is proposed and (iii) the impact of the uncertainties characterisation on the outcome of the analysis is assessed. The results of the analysis considering four different case studies provided evidence that the Standardised Regression Coefficient method for sensitivity analysis should be preferred in the Required Data Reduction Analysis, and that the uncertainty characterisation did not jeopardise the results. Moreover, the proposed minimisation algorithm proved to be effective and fast in reducing the number of parameters. A reduction of 5 to 13 parameters out of 19 to 22 was achieved on the four case studies by requiring 14000 to 22000 model simulations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Data acquisition; Energy monitoring; Industrial energy use; Process integration; RDRA method; Retrofit","Calibration; Data integration; Data reduction; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Industrial plants; Parameter estimation; Retrofitting; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Analysis method; Case-studies; Energy monitoring; Further development; Industrial energy use; Processes integrations; Required data reduction analyse method; Sensitivity analysis techniques; Time consumption; Uncertainty characterization; Data acquisition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119368960

In the face of global warming and energy shortages, food waste can be used as high-value bio-energy raw materials which is also an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel anaerobic digestion and CO2 emissions efficiency analysis based on a Slacks-Based Measure integrating Data Envelopment Analysis (SBM-DEA) model to evaluate and optimize the process structure of anaerobic treatment of food waste. The total feed volume and the discharge volume of liquid digestate are taken as inputs, and the total methane (CH4) production volume is taken as the desirable output and CO2 emissions are regarded as the undesirable output to build the biogas production and CO2 emissions evaluation model during the anaerobic digestion process. Finally, the proposed method is used in the actual anaerobic digestion process. The results show that the overall efficiency values in January, April, May, and June in 2020 are higher than those in other months. At the same time, due to the optimal allocation of slack variables of inputs and undesirable outputs, the efficiency values of other inefficient anaerobic digestion days can be improved. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Carbon dioxide; Food waste; Methane; SBM-DEA model","Anaerobic digestion; Data envelopment analysis; Global warming; Methane; Anaerobic digestion process; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO 2 emission; Data envelopment analysis models; Economy and society; Efficiency analysis; Emission efficiencies; Food waste; Slacks-based measure integrating data envelopment analyse model; World economy; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118882193

Édouard-Montpetit, Montréal (Québec), Canada","The “bridge framework” is a systematic decision-making support tool for process integration retrofit of industrial plants, which proposes the use of “bridge analysis” in a structured fashion. Its potential of rigorously analysing industrial processes has been discussed, but no applications on actually operating plants considering process constraints have been presented to date. The paper demonstrates the capabilities of the bridge framework in analysing an actually operating milk powder production plant. Its step-by-step application is thoroughly described and discussed, highlighting inherent strengths and weaknesses of the method. Moreover, a clarification of the “energy transfer diagram” is proposed, distinguishing avoidable and unavoidable heat degradation in the heat exchanger network by introducing the concept of “limit heat transfer interface”. The results proved that the bridge framework is a rigorous tool, which provided valuable insight to the analyst aiding the open-ended decision-making activities related to the retrofit of both process operations and heat exchanger network. Seven design proposals were identified, out of which the best resulted in 54000 €/y of economic saving with an internal rate of return of 34% and a minimum risk level. The step-by-step application of the method demonstrated that good engineering judgement is critical for achieving beneficial solutions. Expertise on process operations as well as energy analytics is essential for completing the project. Finally, the concept of “limit heat transfer interface” allowed to completely link bridge analysis and pinch analysis and to clarify the meaning of the “grand composite curve”. © 2021 The Authors","Bridge framework; Dairy industry; Heat exchanger network; Pinch analysis; Process integration; Retrofit","Decision making; Earnings; Energy transfer; Heat transfer; Industrial plants; Retrofitting; Bridge analysis; Bridge framework; Dairy industry; Heat exchanger network; Milk powder; Pinch analysis; Powder production; Processes integrations; Production plant; Transfer interface; Heat exchangers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118863635

The inherent non-transparency of the algorithmic management systems makes it difficult for the young workers to understand the underlying mechanisms of the platforms. While the young workers’ autonomy in some important ways is restricted by the algorithmic management systems, the young workers have all chosen the platform work because they feel that it allows them to control where and when they work.

Indonesia called for WTO negotiations with the European Union in December 2019, as the latter has imposed a higher tariff on palm oil. This study employed qualitative research in the form of newspaper content analysis carried out using NVivo 12. Firstly, the most frequent words used by The Jakarta Post and Harian Kompas were revealed through word frequency analysis. Then, sources, stereotyped images, and the cluster of facts or judgements used in the articles were examined. The goal was not only to see which dominant words appeared in both the newspapers, but also to discover whether positive or negative framing was more salient in the discussion of palm oil discrimination. Although The Jakarta Post appeared to use fewer negative words than Harian Kompas, further analysis revealed that both newspapers adopted the same negative tone in their framing. Negative framings were consistently found in their sources, stereotyped images, and clusters of judgements. This finding suggested a level of bias in the newspapers’ discussion of the European Union as the leader in fighting against climate change, and that the RED Initiative and Delegated Act as a way to attain the Paris Agreement, as these aspects of discussion were rather confined in their news coverage © 2021.

Cognitive bias is half the story; political bias the other half. Second, we list the top 10 behavioral biases in project management: (1) strategic misrepresentation, (2) optimism bias, (3) uniqueness bias, (4) the planning fallacy, (5) overconfidence bias, (6) hindsight bias, (7) availability bias, (8) the base rate fallacy, (9) anchoring, and (10) escalation of commitment. Each bias is defined, and its impacts on project management are explained, with examples. Third, base rate neglect is identified as a primary reason that projects underperform. This is supported by presentation of the most comprehensive set of base rates that exist in project management scholarship, from 2,062 projects.

The methodology involves a critical review of the literature on GBVH and organizational responses to it, locating it in the context of an analysis of organizational power. The theoretical perspective involves a focus on power and workplace bullying. It identifies three power-related characteristics of academic environments which it is suggested facilitate GBVH: their male-dominant hierarchical character; their neoliberal managerialist ethos and gender/intersectional incompetent leadership which perpetuates male entitlement and toxic masculinities. These characteristics also inhibit tackling GBVH by depicting it as an individual problem, encouraging informal coping and militating against the prosecution of perpetrators. Initiating a discussion and action at organizational and state levels about GBVH as a power-related phenomenon, challenging the dominant neo-liberal ethos and the hierarchical character of HEIs, as well as reducing their male dominance and increasing the gender competence of those in positions of power are seen as initial steps in tackling the problem. © 2021 by the authors.

Working with Malawi as a representative case of such national policies of value chains for development (VCDs), we investigate how the national ambition of GVC integration is experienced at the level of local communities. The analytical juxtaposition of policy documents and community experiences demonstrates an unmet need for GVC governance that mitigates the potential negative impact that large-scale production for global markets may have on local livelihoods and facilitates local communities’ bottom-up participation in GVCs. On this basis, we introduce the concept of community governance as a supplement to the notions of private and public governance. We argue that the community level must be included in the GVC governance mix in order to ensure livelihood upgrading of all stakeholders. Further, we suggest that moving beyond economic and social upgrading of direct participants will release the potential of the GVC approach to promote inclusive development based on principles of empowerment and self-determination.

Therefore, this study develops a bi-level model that simultaneously determines the location and capacity of the transfer infrastructure to be built considering the elastic demand in a multimodal transport network. The upper-level problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem, whereas the lower-level problem is a combined trip distribution/modal split/assignment model that depicts both the destination and route choices of travellers via a multinomial logit model. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the occurrence of two Braess-like paradox phenomena in a multimodal transport network. The first one states that under fixed demand, constructing new parking spaces to provide the usage of park-and-ride services could deteriorate the system performance measured by the total passengers’ travel time, while the second one reveals that under elastic demand, increasing the parking capacity for park-and-ride services to promote its usage may fail, which would be represented by the decline in their modal share. Meanwhile, a numerical example also suggests that constructing transfer infrastructures at distributed stations outperforms building a large transfer centre in terms of attracting travellers using sustainable transit modes. © 2021 The Authors","Bi-level programming; Multimodal transport; Network design; Paradox","demand elasticity; linear programing; network design; optimization; sustainability; transportation infrastructure; transportation system; travel demand; travel time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119351190

The encounter of other agents, such as wildlife or other visitors, has proven important for preferences, and this is something visitors may affect themselves. Thus, this study focusses on forest visitors’ preferences for forest environments and potential encounters with other agents. 1089 respondents have been asked to consider a choice for change of direction at trail junctions, during a visit to the forest, by ranking five cards representing possible path segments. Each segment constituted a given forest environment (represented by text and a photo) and agent types and numbers (text and an icon), and the direction (text only) – relative to a preferred direction. Results show that on average respondents will detour from their preferred direction, disregarding the forest environment, to experience wildlife. At the other end of the scale, larger groups of mountain bikers or runners can make respondents detour in all forest environments, except for the most preferred ones, to avoid an encounter. Based on a latent class analysis three classes are identified with distinct preferences. 20% of the respondents are unlikely to detour no matter the possible forest environment or agent types. 30% are not affected by encountering other agents, but are to a slight but significant extent affected by the forest environment. The majority, constituting 50% of the population, is strongly influenced by forest environments and even more by potential encounters with other agents. Results largely confirm earlier studies using an ordinal scale, but in addition, we estimate the mutual strength of the preferences and thereby allowing for better guidance of how to manage for forest recreation. Management implications: In our study, a large group of people state that encountering other types of visitors or wild life matters a lot, and often overrules, the diverse utility of different forest environments. This highlights the necessity of focusing on the management trade-offs between nature conservation and recreational use. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agents; Choice modelling; Encounters; Forest environment; Navigation; Recreation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119046181

The COVID-19 pandemic is no exception. Using daily and weekly data on Google searches for 107 countries, this research demonstrates that the COVID-19 crisis resulted in a massive rise in the intensity of prayer. During the early months of the pandemic, Google searches for prayer relative to all Google searches rose by 30%, reaching the highest level ever recorded. A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that by April 1, 2020, more than half of the world population had prayed to end the coronavirus. Prayer searches remained 10% higher than previously throughout 2020, particularly so in Europe and the Americas. Prayer searches rose more among the more religious, rose on all continents, at all levels of income, inequality, and insecurity, and for all types of religion, except Buddhism. The increase is not merely a substitute for services in the physical churches that closed down to limit the spread of the virus. Instead, the rise is due to an intensified demand for religion: People pray to cope with adversity. The results thus reveal that religiosity has risen globally due to the pandemic with potential direct long-term consequences for various socio-economic outcomes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 pandemic; Disaster; Empirical analysis; Google search data; Psychological coping; Religiosity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119040266

While female executives seem to be more oriented towards social and ecological practices, we find strong evidence that participants’ real-world incentive program mainly drives their CSR decision-making.

However, although literature scholars are likely to reference sources or concepts from the social sciences in their published work, the line of influence is much less likely to appear the other way around. This unequal engagement provides the occasion for this paper, which seeks to clarify the ways social scientists might draw influence from literary fiction in the development of their own work as academics: selecting research topics, teaching, and drawing inspiration for projects. A qualitative survey sent to 13,784 social science researchers at 25 different universities asked participants to describe the influence, if any, reading works of literary fiction plays in their academic work or development. The 875 responses to this survey provide numerous insights into the nature of interdisciplinary engagement between these disciplines. First, the survey reveals a skepticism among early-career researchers regarding literature’s social insights compared to their more senior colleagues. Second, a significant number of respondents recognized literary fiction as playing some part in shaping their research interests and expanding their comprehension of subjects relevant to their academic scholarship. Finally, the survey generated a list of literary fiction authors and texts that respondents acknowledged as especially useful for understanding topics relevant to the study of the social sciences. Taken together, the results of the survey provide a fuller account of how researchers engage with literary fiction than can be found in the pages of academic journals, where strict disciplinary conventions might discourage out-of-the-field engagement. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118550837

This is an empirical study based on 113 surveys of managers/entrepreneurs from the Estonian IT sector. The questionnaire was uploaded onto the online platform of connect.ee and the participants were invited to complete it. The study reveals that only conscientiousness positively and significantly predicts causation logic. However, four of the five factors of personality traits positively and significantly predict effectuation logic, i.e., openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, except for neuroticism. Furthermore, only nine of 25 hypotheses are positive and significant, and of the 11 relationships of the model, three are negative and non-significant for causation logic and eight are negative and non-significant for effectuation logic. Finally, there are another five relationships of the model which are positively but non-significantly related. Managers of IT companies in Estonia should think of shifting to effectuation logic as most personality traits predict effectuation logic, and therefore, there is the possibility of a better performance for IT firms. Eight of the 51 items of the model had standardised regression weights below the threshold of 0.500, but only four were extracted from the final model. The extraction of items from the model indicates the need for the re-identification of the constructs of personality traits using, for example, the six-factor personality traits. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as indications have emerged that the personality of partners could be key to a favorable acculturation trajectory, we set out to explore this further. More specifically, we assess the role of expatriate partners’ dispositional affectivity, that is, positive and negative affectivity. We examine this in relation to internal acculturation (in the form of interaction and general adjustment) and external acculturation (in the form of local community embeddedness and intentions to stay or to return home). Drawing on the data of 123 trailing partners, full support was found for three out of four hypotheses regarding the effects of positive affectivity. Further, a marginally significant negative association was identified for the relationship between positive affectivity and repatriation intentions. For negative affectivity, two hypotheses were met. Interestingly, no significant influence of negative affectivity on community embeddedness was found. The association between negative affectivity and interaction adjustment was marginally significant indicating some tentative support. In sum, this study corroborates that dispositional affectivity is an overall important concept to explain trailing partners’ acculturation. However, the role of positive and negative affectivity seems to vary along the different proxies of internal and external acculturation. © The Author(s) 2021.","acculturation; dispositional affectivity; Expatriates; trailing partners",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118339756

The effects of different surface preparation and thermal treatment of the metal layers are investigated, and FLM samples obtained by means of different process routes have been tested by Lap-shear, T-peel and tensile tests. The results demonstrate how a combination of sandblasting and annealing treatments allows to obtain FLM with an interlayer maximum stress respectively of 1.23 and 11.07 MPa along the normal and tangential directions. Then a new exponential traction-separation law is proposed to model the delamination phenomena. Finally, both the proposed process chain and model are validated on the basis of a hat profile part, that was formed and tested. The results demonstrate the possibility to integrate the bonding and forming steps in a single operation, and to model the bonding zone mechanical behaviour. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",,"Laminates; Magnesium printing plates; Shear flow; Tensile testing; Fatigue-resistance; Fibre Metal Laminates; High-strength; Highest temperature; Process chain; Simultaneous bonding; Strength to weight ratio; Structural parts; Traditional materials; Transport industry; Magnesium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117420179

We use a case study approach coupled with protocol analysis to examine the effects of facilitator's actions on team processes as well as interactions between those processes. Our results reveal a distinct distribution of teamwork and taskwork between the facilitator and the team, such that the facilitator guides the teamwork while the team focuses on the taskwork, yet with dynamic shifting in responsibilities between facilitator and team across the duration of the process. Further, we show how a facilitator uses positive affect to mediate interactions between taskwork and teamwork during creative workshops.

Out-of-school adolescents and youth rates (SDG 4.3.1) in lower and middle-income countries have been at a virtual halt for almost a decade. Thus, there is an increasing need to understand geographic variation on accessibility and school attendance to aid in reducing inequalities in education. Here, the aim was to estimate physical accessibility and secondary school non-attendance amongst adolescents and school-age youths in Tanzania, Cambodia, and the Dominican Republic. Community cluster survey data were triangulated with the spatial location of secondary schools, non-proprietary geospatial data and fine-scale population maps to estimate accessibility to all levels of secondary school education and the number of out-of-school. School attendance rates for the three countries were derived from nationally representative household survey data, and a Bayesian model-based geostatistical framework was used to estimate school attendance at high resolution. Results show a sub-national variation in accessibility and secondary school attendance rates for the three countries considered. Attendance was associated with distance to the nearest school (R2 &gt; 70%). These findings suggest increasing the number of secondary schools could reduce the long-distance commuted to school in low-income and middle-income countries.

However, how scaling occurs is scarcely understood. By building on the case studies of two healthcare social enterprises located in India, we make four important contributions to the understanding of the scaling up process. First, we demonstrate that entrepreneurial adjustments are guided by whether social firms prioritize alleviating their internal constraints or those faced by customers. Second, we show how such dynamic prioritization of constraints influences how firms mobilize resources and use operating routines from inception to market establishment. Third, we illustrate how, by pursuing resource mobilization strategies and operating routines, firms generate a ‘deep’ impact by expanding the number and type of their activities or a ‘broad’ one by increasing their membership base and/or geographic area. Finally, our findings show that the prioritization of internal or customer constraints leads firms to establish different sequences of elements of institutional legitimacy—i.e., normative, regulatory, and cognitive ones.

Drawing on network science, the article quantifies process modularity over time using archival data from an engineering design process of a biomass power plant. This article shows how studying the temporal evolution of process modularity enables a more complete understanding of activity networks, facilitates the comparison of actual process modularity patterns against formal engineering design stages, and provides data-driven decision-support for process planning and interventions. Finally, managerial recommendations for interface management, resource allocation, and process decomposition are proposed, to help practitioners better to understand and manage dynamic processes. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Design process; modularity; network analysis; process modularity","Electrical engineering; Engineering; Biomass power plants; Data driven decision; Engineering design process; Formal engineerings; Interface management; Process decompositions; Process execution; Temporal evolution; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114054607

These have led to high ratios of non-performing loans (NPLs), which affect the stability of the financial industry and undermine economic recovery. The result has been a need for faster debt enforcement and a drastic increase in abusive informal debt collection practices (IDCPs). In the EU, the need to regulate and harmonize abusive IDCPs surfaced in 2018 in connection to the Proposal for a Directive on Credit Servicers, Credit Purchasers and the Recovery of Collateral (CSDP). The directive would enable banks to outsource the servicing of NPLs to a specialized debt collector, but it contained no protection rules against abusive IDCPs. In this article, the researcher critically assesses the need for harmonization of the legal framework concerning abusive IDCPs in the EU, mainly from the standpoint of the initial and current text of the CSDP. Where necessary, the researcher will refer to both historical and comparative law perspectives. The researcher focuses on the legal character of informal debt collection, its relation to financial services, and its potential sui generis character. After that, the researcher will address the arguments for and against establishing pan-EU sector-specific legislation dedicated to IDCPs. Next, the researcher discusses the constitutional authority of the EU to regulate abusive IDCPs. Finally, the researcher will examine the interaction of the CSDP with other consumer (financial) protection instruments to identify the best solution for harmonizing abusive IDCPs at the EU level. The researcher will juxtapose several dichotomies: general versus sector-specific, procedural versus substantive, minimum versus maximum harmonization, and hard versus soft regulation. In the conclusion, the researcher shall synthesize the core problems and suggest an approach. © 2021, The Author(s).","Abusive practices; Consumer protection; Credit servicing; Debt collection; Harmonization; Internal market; Nonperforming loans",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113838002

This may provide a better understanding of disease aetiology and risk factors as well as enable targeted prevention and allocation of resources. Joint mapping of multiple diseases may lead to improved insights since e.g. similarities and differences between geographic patterns may reflect shared and disease-specific determinants of disease. The objective of this study was to compare the geographic patterns in incident acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke and atrial fibrillation (AF) using the unique, population-based Danish register data. Methods: Incident AMI, stroke and AF was modelled by a multivariate Poisson model including a disease-specific random effect of municipality modelled by a multivariate conditionally autoregressive (MCAR) structure. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and income. Results: The study included 3.5 million adults contributing 6.8 million person-years. In total, 18,349 incident cases of AMI, 28,006 incident cases of stroke, and 39,040 incident cases of AF occurred. Estimated municipality-specific standardized incidence rates ranged from 0.76 to 1.35 for AMI, from 0.79 to 1.38 for stroke, and from 0.85 to 1.24 for AF. In all diseases, geographic variation with clusters of high or low risk of disease after adjustment was seen. The geographic patterns displayed overall similarities between the diseases, with stroke and AF having the strongest resemblances. The most notable difference was observed in Copenhagen (high risk of stroke and AF, low risk of AMI). AF showed the least geographic variation. Conclusion: Using multiple-disease mapping, this study adds to the results of previous studies by enabling joint evaluation and comparison of the geographic patterns in AMI, stroke and AF. The simultaneous mapping of diseases displayed similarities and differences in occurrence that are non-assessable in traditional single-disease mapping studies. In addition to reflecting the fact that AF is a strong risk factor for stroke, the results suggested that AMI, stroke and AF share some, but not all environmental risk factors after accounting for age, sex and income (indicator of lifestyle and health behaviour). © 2021, The Author(s).","Cardiovascular disease; Epidemiology; Geographic variation; Multiple-disease mapping","cardiovascular disease; disease incidence; epidemiology; geographical variation; mapping method; multivariate analysis; risk factor; Denmark; Indicator indicator; adult; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; Denmark; heart infarction; human; Adult; Atrial Fibrillation; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Stroke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113829404

To test our hypotheses, we draw on a dataset of 5,703 open-source software projects registered on SourceForge.net.

Overlooked in past research is how individuals who experience restrictions construe information. We propose that individuals with temporary (permanent) restrictions adopt a more concrete (abstract) level of construal. Theoretically, perceptions of loss of control explain the construal level of consumers with temporary (vs. permanent) restrictions. We tested our hypotheses in a series of four quasi-experiment studies both in the field and online, including samples of individuals with diabetes and celiac disease. The results show that individuals who experience temporary (permanent) restrictions adopt more concrete (abstract) levels of construal, which results in their preference for products that communicate brand (category) attributes and shelves that contain only restriction-related (mixture of restriction- and no restriction-related) products. These findings extend developments in the literature on restrictions and construal level theory by showing the effects of duration of restrictions on individuals’ mindset and generate actionable implications for marketers and policymakers. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","construal level; information processing; loss of control; restrictions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111895127

More than half of respondents reported engaging with music to cope. People experiencing increased negative emotions used music for solitary emotional regulation, whereas people experiencing increased positive emotions used music as a proxy for social interaction. Light gradient-boosted regressor models were used to identify the most important predictors of an individual’s use of music to cope, the foremost of which was, intriguingly, their interest in “coronamusic.” Overall, our results emphasise the importance of real-time musical responses to societal crises, as well as individually tailored adaptations in musical behaviours to meet socio-emotional needs. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111253839

According to Philip Strong, the founder of the sociological study of epidemic infectious diseases, not only is an epidemic biological; there is also the potential for three psycho-social epidemics: of fear, moralization, and action. This work empirically tests Strong’s model at scale by studying the use of language of 122M tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic posted in the U.S. during the whole year of 2020. On Twitter, we identified three distinct phases. Each of them is characterized by different regimes of the three psycho-social epidemics. In the refusal phase, users refused to accept reality despite the increasing number of deaths in other countries. In the anger phase (started after the announcement of the first death in the country), users’ fear translated into anger about the looming feeling that things were about to change. Finally, in the acceptance phase, which began after the authorities imposed physical-distancing measures, users settled into a “new normal” for their daily activities. Overall, refusal of accepting reality gradually died off as the year went on, while acceptance increasingly took hold.

Assembling an attractive set of offers to display to customers therefore represents a new joint pricing and assortment optimization problem in airline revenue management. In this paper, we introduce an initial optimization approach for the selection and pricing of a la carte and bundled flight and ancillary offers. First, we propose a customer choice model that captures the impact of ancillary bundles on flight itinerary choice. We then calculate prices for each offer from a continuous range of price points and display the offer set that maximizes expected revenue for a given customer segment. We illustrate the approach using a single-flight, single-ancillary base case and discuss extensions to more complex environments. Tests in the Passenger Origin–Destination Simulator (PODS) show that dynamic offer generation (DOG) can increase net revenue when used by one or more airlines in a competitive network, assuming that the airlines are able to accurately segment incoming requests and estimate the average willingness-to-pay of each segment. We find that the majority of the revenue gains of DOG are due to competitive effects from the dynamic pricing of the flight component of the offer. The bundling mechanism of DOG is a secondary source of revenue gain that can be realized when customers take bundled ancillary services into account when choosing the flight. Our results provide insight for practitioners that are implementing offer optimization systems and processes. For example, in line with the previous literature on bundle pricing, we find that in transparent distribution channels an ancillary service should be bundled with the flight when the valuation for the ancillary is high or when its marginal cost of provision is low. We close by discussing the strategic and managerial implications of a move from traditional distribution strategies to a next-generation, offer-focused approach. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Airline revenue management; Assortment optimization; Dynamic offers; Dynamic pricing; New Distribution Capability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109915336

The advent of IATA’s new distribution capability (NDC) will soon enable airlines to quote any fare from a continuous range. In theory, such continuous pricing could increase revenues by extracting more of the consumer surplus, through its ability to offer more granular fares, closer to the customer’s willingness-to-pay (WTP). In this article, we describe several algorithms that lead to the quotation of a single fare from a continuous range. These algorithms either rely on traditional fare classes for the purpose of forecasting and optimization (class-based), or completely abandon the notion of fare classes, instead assuming different WTP distributions within each booking period prior to departure (classless). We describe how these algorithms build upon and differ from their traditional RM counterparts. Performance of these heuristics is then benchmarked against traditional class-based RM, and competitive impacts are analyzed when continuous pricing is adopted by one airline asymmetrically or both airlines symmetrically in a hypothetical 2-carrier network in the passenger origin–destination simulator (PODS). We find that continuous pricing is generally revenue-positive, and the revenue gains can be as high as 2.0% for the first-mover and reach up to 1.2% when both airlines adopt the new method. In addition, we show that these gains depend on the number of fare classes in the traditional fare structure used as a baseline, and that they are smaller under lower demand-to-capacity ratios. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Airline revenue management; Continuous pricing; Dynamic pricing; New distribution capability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109588676

Excluding Bitcoin's own shocks, United State and European markets are the main contagion sources to Bitcoin. European market also works as a intermediary to deliver infectious from United State and market fear. The findings show that gold always has contagion effect with Bitcoin, while gold, US dollar and bond market are the contagion receivers of Bitcoin under the shock of COVID-19.

From agricultural produce export and fishery powerhouse to an oil & gas offshore hub and finally, a centre for energy technology, Esbjerg has shown a remarkable ability to adapt to survive and grow. Yet Esbjerg has struggled as an undesirable place with prolonged negative images as the wild west of Denmark, on the periphery of civilization with foul smells. Through a historical approach, this city profile paper discusses the evolution of Esbjerg and its images, and how the city has attempted to overcome its negative images them by means of establishing a place brand. In doing so, the paper emphasises how the self-styled “Energy Metropolis” has used its place brand as a catalyst for aligning branding activities with urban governance strategies, highlighting the importance of including residents when establishing a place brand, defining the brands (geographical) territory and the need for a branded house strategy. The case of Esbjerg demonstrates the necessity of avoiding myopia and introducing collaborative partnerships to overcome negative images. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","City branding; Esbjerg; Historical approach; Negative images; Place branding; Prolonged negative images; Urban governance","governance approach; historical perspective; strategic approach; urban development; urban economy; urban geography; urban growth; urban history; Denmark; Esbjerg; Syddanmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109009352

The data collection included ethnography and a focus group discussion (n = 10) with athletes, coaches, parents, and the national governing body. The authors supplemented these with 26 interviews with stakeholders, and we analyzed the data using grounded theory. The core concept found was that power relations were further divided into systemic power and informational power. Systemic power (e.g., formal authority to reward or punish) denotes how the national governing bodies sought to implement change from the top-down and impose new strategies on the organization. The informational power (e.g., tacit feeling of oneness and belonging) represented how individuals and subunits mobilized coalitions to support or obstruct the sports organization’s agenda.

Recently, however, this way of understanding KT has received criticism for presenting too basic an understanding of knowledge and not fully grasping the potential of the term translation. Based on qualitative material from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and a follow-up study, this article takes the current discussion of KT one step further, focussing on how KT happens among healthy citizens participating in a lifestyle intervention. The overall argument is that even current critical understandings of KT often ignore the fact that the translation of medical knowledge does not stop at the clinical encounter but extends into the everyday health practices of the population. A more nuanced understanding of how and in which forms medical knowledge is adopted by people in their everyday health practices will give new insights into the complex mechanisms of KT and the encounter between medical knowledge and practice and everyday life. Hence, this article discuss how knowledge from a clinical trial—focussing on muscular training and increased protein intake—is translated into meaningful health practices. The article concludes the following points: First, constant, and often precarious, work is required to maintain the content of ‘medical knowledge’ in a complex social order. Second, focussing on translation work in everyday life emphasises that KT is an open-ended process, wherein the medical object of knowledge is contested and renegotiated and needs alliances with other objects of knowledge in order to remain relevant. Last, from an everyday life perspective, medical knowledge is just one rationale making up the fabric of people’s health practices; other rationales, such as time, feasibility, logistics and social relations, are just as relevant in determining how and why people pursue healthy living or comply with a medical regimen.

Researchers have noted the important role that intermediary organizations such as incubators play in connecting various actors within ecosystems. Yet our understanding of this role is limited to a few empirical insights. Using resource dependence and embeddedness as theoretical lenses, the present research examines the role of incubators in entrepreneurial ecosystem formation and function, and analyzes how intermediation activities shape collaboration patterns embedded within entrepreneurial ecosystems. Our findings are based on an empirical investigation of two entrepreneurial ecosystems, one in Kenya and one in Uganda. Our analysis of 38 semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurial actors in these ecosystems reveals the underlying structural, operational, and relational conditions that influence the actors’ interaction with each other. We propose three collaboration patterns that emerge among actors in entrepreneurial ecosystems under these conditions: one-sided dependency-based, joint dependency-based, and mutual dependency-based collaborations. We discuss these patterns in detail and identify the circumstances in which each is most likely to occur. This empirical setting clearly shows that beyond their primary roles of providing space, network, and advice to entrepreneurs, intermediary organizations in entrepreneurial ecosystems play a significant role in orchestrating collaborations. Finally, we reflect on the limitations of this study and offer implications for future research. © 2021 The Authors","Collaboration; Embeddedness factors; Entrepreneurial ecosystem; Incubator; Intermediary organization; Resource dependence theory","Engineering; Collaboration patterns; Embeddedness; Empirical investigation; Implications for futures; Most likely; Mutual dependencies; Resource dependences; Semi structured interviews; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108408204

We suggest that valuable evidence can be gleaned from the “Spanish” flu of 1918–20. It is well-known that the world fell into a protectionist spiral following the First World War, but scholars have almost exclusively ignored the impact of the pandemic. We employ a difference-in-differences strategy and find that the flu had a significant impact on trade policy, independent of the war. In our preferred specification, a one standard deviation increase in excess deaths during the outbreak implied 0.022 percentage points higher tariffs subsequently, corresponding to an increase of one third of a standard deviation in tariffs.

We use the recently-proposed variations in the price of gold, around events associated with unexpected changes in uncertainty as an instrument to identify uncertainty shocks in a proxy Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR) model. Moreover, to control for news-related effects associated with these events, uncertainty and news shocks are jointly identified based on a set-identified proxy SVAR, as recently suggested in the VAR literature. Our results show that the uncertainty shock generates a larger negative impact on REITs returns over the post-GFC period to the extent that it also outweighs the impact of the otherwise dominant news (productivity) shocks. In addition, the impulse response dynamics related to the recursively identified uncertainty shock, as is standard in the literature, resembles the effects of a news shock, and somewhat contrary to intuition suggests that the impact of the uncertainty shock on REITs returns were higher during the pre-GFC era. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Monetary policy regimes; Proxy SVAR model; U.S. REITs; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107162044

Our study pays special attention to the developmental dependencies of the components of the infrastructure’s installed base and how the interdependencies between the platform core and periphery evolve over time. We use the notion of ‘generative entrenchment’ to provide an account of the formation and unfolding of a core–periphery structure from an evolving digital infrastructure that highlights three aspects of the process. First, the process of architectural evolution that our study depicts comprises three phases showing a gradual reversal of the entrenchment relationship of the platform core and periphery: (1) entrenchment of the periphery, (2) mutual entrenchment of the core and periphery, and (3) entrenchment of the core. Second, we show how the generatively entrenched infrastructure’s installed base shaped the decisions and choices regarding the initial platform core. Third, we identify three architectural practices (creating redundancy in the core, augmenting the core with novelty, and reducing the heterogeneity of an entrenched peripheral component and later integrating it into the core) that weakened the entrenchment of the peripheral components, amplified the role of the core, and consolidated the core–periphery structure. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2021.","architecture; core–periphery structure; Digital infrastructure; digital platform; evolution; generative entrenchment; installed base","Architectural evolution; Digital infrastructures; Digital platforms; Peripheral components; Three phasis; Architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107149790

However, extant research shows ambivalent results regarding the effectiveness of wearables in improving users’ health behavior. Specifically important is understanding users’ systematic behavior change through wearables. Constructive digitalization of the healthcare system requires a deeper understanding of why some users change their behavior and others do not. Based on self-leadership theory and our analysis of narrative interviews with 50 long-term wearable users, we identify four wearable use patterns that bring about different behavioral outcomes: following, ignoring, combining, and self-leading.

As a base case, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used and compared the results with multivariate modelling frameworks that could integrate exogenous variables, that is, ARIMAX and Vector Autoregressive (VAR). We find that incorporating the Logistics Confidence Index (LCI) provided by Transport Intelligence into the ARIMAX model improves forecast performance greatly. Hence, a sampling of sentiments, perceptions and/or confidence from a panel of practitioners active in the maritime shipping market contributes to an improved predictive power, even when compared to models that integrate hard facts in the sense of factual data collected by official statistical sources. While investigating the Far East to Northern Europe trade route only, we believe that the proposed approach of integrating such judgements by practitioners can improve forecast performance for other trade routes and shipping markets, too, and probably allows detection of market changes and/or economic development notably earlier than factual data available at that time. © 2021 The Authors","Confidence; Container shipping; Forecasting; Freight rate; Perception; Sentiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106314647

Furthermore, although analyses often eschew “snapshot” perspectives, short-run perceptions that the UK could, by joining the AIIB at that point, gain a first mover advantage that would provide greater access to Chinese markets, secure contracts across Asia for British firms, and enable the City of London to win an even greater share of the offshore renminbi trade proved decisive. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Development finance; First mover advantage; Infrastructure; United Kingdom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105938019

Hence, this is why some are puzzled by born globals (BGs), firms that make large foreign sales at birth or shortly afterwards. Explanations given for this “anomaly” are that BGs have exceptional resources—advanced technologies and a high international orientation on the part of their entrepreneurs, and that they rely on cheaper internationalization strategies like the Internet and networks. What is almost completely overlooked is the role of the BG’s business model (BM). We analyze the time it took for a sample of Italian SMEs to reach BG status (25% foreign over total sales) within a three-year time span. Entering both international entrepreneurship (IE) and BM variables, we find that, among the IE variables, a firm’s technological intensity, the number of years their founders studied abroad and their foreign language fluency, as well as their use of domestic networks, are statistically insignificant. Variables measuring a firm’s focus on a niche BM, on the other hand, are statistically significant, along with the international work experience of the founders, with the niche BM explaining a higher level of variance with greater accuracy. © 2021, The Author(s).","born globals; business models; internalization theory; international entrepreneurship; survival analysis; Uppsala model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105791970

Engaging critically with Perlmutter’s framework and the broader global mindset literature, and drawing on insights curated from a 2-year field study, we reveal the existence of the anomic mindset among a cohort of international managers. We conceptualize this mindset as a stock of knowledge, cognitive and psychological attributes that results in these managers returning to and entrenching themselves in an outdated, most probably idealized, world view of business in opposition to a changing socio-economic context. Its presence sees them resisting rather than adapting to the globalization that surrounds them, and leads them to engage in detours from the pathway toward the development of a global mindset. Unlike the ethnocentric mindset which describes ex ante managerial thinking in organizations moving toward internationalization, the anomic mindset results from the ex post responses of managers following a protracted period of involvement in international business. Its existence opens up a significant debate on progress in, and the prospects for, globalization and the development of global mindsets, along with their preservation in the face of this persistent anomie. © 2021, Academy of International Business.","abduction; anomic mindset; ethnocentric; ethnography; global leadership; global mindset; globalization; managerial cognition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105177818

Designing a viable carsharing system is challenging and often depends on local conditions as well as on a myriad of operational decisions that need to be supported by suitable decision-support systems. Therefore, carsharing is being increasingly studied in the Operations Management (OM) literature. Nevertheless, often due to the limited transparency of this highly competitive sector and the recency of this business, there is still a “gap of understanding” of the scientific community concerning the business practices and contexts, often resulting in over-simplifications and relevant problems being overlooked.

However, there is a lack of knowledge surrounding platform business models enabling individualized care coordination for patients with rare diseases. This paper analyses the development of a complex platform business model addressing Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, a severe neurological disease that requires the coordination of a diverse network of medical specialists, care, and equipment providers. A longitudinal case study examines the platform’s development, focusing subsequently on qualitative and efficient care coordination, care research, and active and direct involvement of patients, as well as establishing two business models, namely, care coordination and care research. We reconstruct how these complex platform business models were configured to improve patient care and care research, thereby creating immediate value for patients and insights for long-term care improvements.

Using personal health record (PHR) apps as an example, this study identifies how potential users in Germany and Denmark evaluate a set of 26 app features, and whether evaluation differences can be explained by the differences in four pertinent user characteristics, namely privacy concerns, mHealth literacy, mHealth self-efficacy, and adult playfulness. Based on survey data from both countries, we employed the Kano method to evaluate PHR features and applied a quartile-based sample-split approach to understand the underlying relationships between user characteristics and their perceptions of features. Our results not only reveal significant differences in 14 of the features between Germans and Danes, they also demonstrate which of the user characteristics best explain each of these differences. Our two key contributions are, first, to explain the evaluation of specific PHR app features on user satisfaction in two different healthcare contexts and, second, to demonstrate how to extend the Kano method in terms of explaining subgroup differences through user characteristic antecedents.

The continuous construction of subways, however, causes large amounts of construction materials and embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we characterized the patterns of subway development, construction material stocks, and embodied emissions covering all 219 cities in the world in which subways are found by July 2020. The global subway length reached 16,419 km in 2020, and the construction material stocks amounted to 2.5 gigatons, equaling to an embodied emission of 560 megatons. In particular, China’s subway system contributes to ~40% of the total global stocks, with a pattern of moderate and steady stocks growth before 2010 and a rapid expansion afterwards, implying the late-development advantages and infrastructure-based urbanization mode. Our results demonstrated that identifying the spatiotemporal characteristics of subway materials stocks development is imperative for benchmarking future resource demand, informing sustainable subway planning, prospecting urban mining and waste management opportunities and challenges, and mitigating the associated environmental impacts for global GHG emission reduction. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102927846

This article argues for a more complex analysis of AV futures in which images are understood as vessels for sociotechnical imaginaries that direct and delimit what we think is possible in the future. Through an analytical framework incorporating automobility, transitions, and imaginaries, I explore how depictions of AVs frame the technology as responding to various system pressures over time through a comparative analysis of two actors. The analysis suggests that regime actors deploy visual discursive material as a tool of regime stability or change to benefit their own agendas. The intention of the article is not to anticipate current trajectories but is a methodological exploration of how policymakers and planners can interpret AV visualisations. Therefore, the paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these imaginaries for future transportation systems. It further suggests that policymakers and planners need to take a more active role in the development of AV futures by paying much more attention to the latent meanings behind AV visualisations and working collaboratively with those who produce them. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102256064

Approximately 44% of AF cases cannot be explained by common individual risk factors and risk might therefore also be related to the environment. By studying geographical variation and clustering in risk of incident AF adjusted for socioeconomic position at an individual level, potential neighbourhood risk factors could be revealed. Methods: Initially, yearly AF incidence rates 1987–2015 were estimated overall and stratified by income in a register-based cohort study. To examine geographical variation and clustering in AF, we used both spatial scan statistics and a hierarchical Bayesian Poisson regression analysis of AF incidence rates with random effect of municipalities (n = 98) in Denmark in 2011–2015. Results: The 1987–2015 cohort included 5,453,639 individuals whereof 369,800 were diagnosed with an incident AF. AF incidence rate increased from 174 to 576 per 100,000 person-years from 1987 to 2015. Inequality in AF incidence rate ratio between highest and lowest income groups increased from 23% in 1987 to 38% in 2015. We found clustering and geographical variation in AF incidence rates, with incidence rates at municipality level being up to 34% higher than the country mean after adjusting for socioeconomic position. Conclusions: Geographical variations and clustering in AF incidence rates exist. Compared to previous studies from Alberta, Canada and the United States, we show that geographical variations exist in a country with free access to healthcare and even when accounting for socioeconomic differences at an individual level. An increasing social inequality in AF was seen from 1987 to 2015. Therefore, when planning prevention strategies, attention to individuals with low income should be given. Further studies focusing on identification of neighbourhood risk factors for AF are needed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Atrial fibrillation; Bayesian analysis; Cluster analysis; Epidemiology; Health registers; Health status disparities","Bayesian analysis; cardiovascular disease; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; epidemiology; geographical variation; health care; health status; neighborhood; socioeconomic status; Denmark; Alberta; Alberta; atrial fibrillation; Bayes theorem; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; Denmark; human; incidence; risk factor; socioeconomics; United States; Alberta; Atrial Fibrillation; Bayes Theorem; Cluster Analysis; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Humans; Incidence; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101854173

The neighborhood environment represents an important arena for modifying these behaviors, and hence reliable and valid tools to measure it are needed. Most existing virtual audit tools have been designed to assess either food or activity environments deemed relevant for adults. Thus, there is a need for a tool that combines the assessment of food and activity environments, and which focuses on aspects of the environment relevant for youth. Objective: The aims of the present study were: (a) to adapt the SPOTLIGHT Virtual Audit Tool (S-VAT) developed to assess characteristics of the built environment deemed relevant for adults for use in an adolescent population, (b) to assess the tool’s inter- and intra-rater reliability, and (c) to assess its criterion validity by comparing the virtual audit to a field audit. Methods: The tool adaptation was based on literature review and on results of a qualitative survey investigating how adolescents perceived the influence of the environment on dietary and physical activity behaviors. Sixty streets (148 street segments) in six neighborhoods were randomly selected as the study sample. Two raters assessed the inter- and intra-rater reliability and criterion validity, comparing the virtual audit tool to a field audit. The results were presented as percentage agreement and Cohen’s kappa (κ). Results: Intra-rater agreement was found to be moderate to almost perfect (κ = 0.44–0.96) in all categories, except in the category aesthetics (κ = 0.40). Inter-rater agreement between auditors ranged from fair to substantial for all categories (κ = 0.24–0.80). Criterion validity was found to be moderate to almost perfect (κ = 0.56–0.82) for most categories, except aesthetics and grocery stores (κ = 0.26–0.35). Conclusion: The adapted version of the S-VAT can be used to provide reliable and valid data on built environment characteristics deemed relevant for physical activity and dietary behavior among adolescents. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adolescence; Built environment; Dietary behavior; Physical activity; Virtual audit","adolescence; consumption behavior; dietary intake; neighborhood; physical activity; public health; adolescence; adolescent; adult; article; built environment; controlled study; diet; esthetics; female; grocery store; human; human experiment; interrater reliability; intrarater reliability; juvenile; male; neighborhood; physical activity; randomized controlled trial; validity; demography; exercise; questionnaire; reproducibility; Adolescent; Adult; Built Environment; Exercise; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Residence Characteristics; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100128156

Much attention has been on users’ involvement in IT design, while users’ engagement in later further utilization of IT is less explored. This paper reports on action research (AR) that sought to stimulate local learning processes and increase the exploitation of a case-handling system. The experiment is done in a county administration where the senior management has, for some time, felt that the IT is not fully utilized. The local intervention was based on an awareness of a need to overcome defensive routines to establish communicative spaces to facilitate communication between various units with strong local identities. The AR project was carried out in three local interventions and presented as an experimental approach. We could not guarantee that the design could overcome the issues identified after the first round of interviews with senior management and department managers.

With each of the data sets, we analyse the effective tax rates that US MNCs face in each country and the amount of profits they report. Using country-by-country reporting data, we have been able to establish that lower effective corporate tax rates are associated with higher levels of reported profits when compared with different indicators of real economic activity. This corresponds to the notion that MNCs often shift profits to countries with low effective tax rates—without also shifting substantive economic activity.

Building on a mixed method study of Danish visual artists’ livelihoods and drawing on the total social organization of labour perspective, the article maps a diverse spectrum of labour practices ranging from formal paid/unpaid work to informal cash-in-hand work and non-monetized barter exchanges, to wholly non-commodified everyday practices of mutual aid and favour-swapping, as well as ‘consumption work’ such as thrift and self-provisioning.

However, extant theories, emphasizing structural factors such as initial endowments and warfare, do little to explain the initial emergence of institutions of urban self-government before CE 1200 or why similar institutions did not emerge outside of Europe. We argue that a large-scale collapse of public authority in the ninth and tenth centuries allowed a bottom-up reform movement in West Francia (the Cluniac movement), directed by clergy but with popular backing, to push for ecclesiastical autonomy and asceticism in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. These social realignments, facilitated by new norms about ecclesiastical office holding, stimulated the urban associationalism that led to the initial emergence of autonomous town councils. Using a panel data set of 643 towns in the period between 800 and 1800, we show that medieval towns were substantially more likely to establish autonomous town councils in the period between 1000 and 1200 if they were situated in the vicinity of Cluniac monasteries. These findings are corroborated by regressions that use distance from Cluny - the movement's place of origin - to instrument for proximity to Cluniac monasteries.

This review aims to synthesize case studies of rural place branding in order to identify different types of processes applied and relating them to the contextual factors underlying their application. A typology of five rural place branding processes (PBP) is proposed, based on the existence and dominance of a focal actor, and other actors involved in the process. Six contextual factors that affect the application of the various PBP are identified: (1) type of place distinguishing between places with or without administrative power, (2) initiative referring to the difference between political/administrative, community, mixed, (3) support base for the branding distinguishing between strong political/organizational, strong community, strong identity, (4) brand purpose, i.e., competitiveness, identity, conservation; (5) target group, and (6) type of place brand referring to the difference between sectoral and integrated place brands. Patterns of the contextual factors have been identified that seem to be typical for the application of the different PBP types. The findings provide guidance to rural place managers and communities to apply a PBP that matches their specific context. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.","Co-creation; Contextual factors; Place branding; Processes; Resource integration; Rural places",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092465905

This study explores the influence of bonding, bridging, and linking social capital networks and the inherent notion of trust on co-production with vulnerable citizens. The study has found the formation of social capital to be a significant influencer on enabling co-production with vulnerable citizens. This is particularly so when engaging the citizens at earlier stages in the public service cycle than the implementation phase. Being engaged at these stages positively influences the motivation to participate. The end-user as co-designer, or co-initiator of public services, is rarely found in the literature. This study contributes to fill this gap. Furthermore, calculus-based trust is identified as a main factor influencing the willingness of potential co-production partners to engage in co-production. The findings are based on observations, documents, and interviews from an extreme case where a group of Danish-Somali women, (this particular group being among the most vulnerable in Danish society), changed from being dismissive potential co-implementers to becoming co-initiators of co-production aimed at preventing crime among Danish-Somali youth. © 2020, International Society for Third-Sector Research.","Calculus-based and relational trust; Extreme case study; Marginalized communities; Public co-production; Social capital networks","crime; public service; social capital; welfare provision; womens organization; young population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085323199

We propose that entrepreneurship holds a low rather than a negative information value, increasing the uncertainty around a job applicant's future productivity. Employers respond to this uncertainty by discounting the offered wage. The theory predicts that uncertainty in hiring—and thus the wage penalty—is more pronounced for entrepreneurs (a) who were in the upper tail of the wage distribution before the entrepreneurial spell, (b) who exited entrepreneurship quickly, and (c) who are hired by small employers. We test and find empirical support for these predictions using a novel dataset of matched entrepreneurs and employees from Belgium. Managerial Summary: We investigate the effect of past entrepreneurial experience on the future wages of entrepreneurs who go back to paid employment. We propose that former entrepreneurs receive a pay cut because employers consider them as risky hires. In line with our theory, we find that former entrepreneurs are penalized the most (a) if they were highly paid employees before becoming founders, (b) if they were entrepreneurs only for a few years, (c) and if they are hired by small employers. Our findings caution star employees from experimenting with an entrepreneurial career, as failing fast is costly. Moreover, we suggest that firms value probationary contracts to lower the risk of hiring entrepreneurs while learning about their skills. © 2019 Strategic Management Society","entrepreneurship; prior wage; returns; stigma of failure; uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075742695

The authors further investigate the effectiveness of using recovery co-creation in minimizing customers’ counterfactual thinking. Design/methodology/approach: This research includes textual analysis of online reviews (Study 1) and three scenario-based experiments (Studies 2, 3a and 3b). In addition to using item-response scales, the authors analyze negative online reviews and participants’ open-ended responses to capture their counterfactual thinking. Findings: Failed recovery (vs failed delivery) increases counterfactual thinking, which, in turn, increases negative eWOM. These mediating effects of counterfactual thinking are consistent across textual analyses and experimental studies, as well as across different measures of counterfactual thinking. Counterfactual thinking also impacts customer anger in experiments; however, anger alone does not explain the effects of failed recovery on negative eWOM. Counterfactual thinking can be minimized by co-created recovery, especially when it is used proactively. Practical implications: The findings demonstrate the detrimental effects of counterfactual thinking and offer managerial insights into co-creation as a strategy to minimize customers’ counterfactual thinking. The authors also highlight the importance and ways of tracking counterfactual thinking in digital outlets. Originality/value: The authors contribute to counterfactual thinking and service recovery research by demonstrating the effects of failed recovery on counterfactual thinking that, in turn, impacts negative eWOM and offering a novel way to measure its expression in online narratives.

The study first explores the experiential value co-created when consumers voluntarily self-disclose on public platforms. Second, it sheds light on what motivates such consumers to disclose private self-images and experiences, thus giving up some degree of privacy on an unrestricted platform. Design/methodology/approach: This study conducted 65 laddering interviews and observed the profiles of ten consumers, who actively posted self-images on Instagram, through a netnographic study. Then, this study implemented a means-ends chain analysis on interview data. Findings: This study found that online private self-disclosure can involve a co-created experiential value that consists of consumers’ self-affirmation, affective belief and emotional connection. These value components derive from three higher-order psychological consequences – empowerment, buffering offline inadequacy of self-worth and engagement – and four functional consequences – opportunity to learn, online control, self-brand authenticity and impression management. Implications: Operationally, this study proposes that Instagram could be configured and synched with other social networking sites to provide a more complete representation of the online self. Using algorithms that simultaneously pull from other social networking sites can emotionally connect consumers to a more relevant and gratifying personalized experience. Additionally, managers could leverage the findings to tailor supporting tools to transfer consumers’ private self-disclosure skills learned during online communication into their offline settings. Originality: This research contributes to the extant marketing literature by providing insights into how consumers can use private self-disclosure to co-create experiential value, an emerging concept in modern marketing that is key to attaining satisfied and loyal consumers. This study shows that, even in anonymous online settings, consumers are willing to self-disclose and progress to stable intimate exchanges of disclosure by breaking their inner repression and becoming more comfortable with releasing their desires in an emotional exchange. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Experiential value; Laddering; Means-ends chain analysis; Private identity; Self-disclosure; Social networking sites",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115216038

The following questions are addressed: How do business networks impact organizational learning at trade shows? Can relational ties between networks influence organizational learning? Does trust play a role between different network types and organizational learning? Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical framework for this research is based on the broad spectrum of social exchange theory (Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005; Foa and Foa, 1974, 1980; Kelley and Thibault, 1978; Kelley, 1997). Social exchange theory has several different interpretations; one common view of this theory involves a series of interactions that result in obligations for the participating members (Emerson, 1976; Cropanzano and Mitchell, 2005). This model extends the Levin and Cross (2004) model presented in their article, “strength of weak ties you can trust: the mediating role of trust in effective knowledge transfer”. Findings: This paper is a review and synthesis of trade show, trust, organizational learning and business network literature. This conceptual paper concludes with eight propositions, which delve into connections between micro and macro networks, strong and weak ties in these networks and the effect on organizational learning. Trust is the mediating variable between networks and organizational learning. High levels of trust could change the learning approach (adaptive, generative or transformative) of the different networks. Research limitations/implications: The propositions integrate extant research on trade shows and will guide future research regarding the relationship between types of business networks, trust and organizational learning. Practical implications: This conceptual paper looks at trade shows from a network perspective; specifically, how do trade show networks impact organizational learning. Trade show participation results in different approaches to organizational learning, which can be modified based on the level of trust that exists between network members. Trade show participation enables both adaptive and generative learning. However, atypical interactions between business networks occasionally produce transformative learning. Originality/value: This conceptual paper offers an innovative approach to trade show research by analyzing the relationship between trade shows and organizational learning from a network perspective, using trust as the mediating variable. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive; Generative; Micro/macro networks; Organizational learning; Trade shows; Transformative; Trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086775528

However, the analysis of MPs and NPs is impeded by the lack of standardized methods with the shortage of the knowledge on chemical composition (e.g., molecular weight) of plastic polymers and on the interactive roles between physico-chemical, biological (e.g., plastic-microbe interactions), and environmental attributes. Also, the gap between accurate quantitative analysis of plastic particles and the health hazards is huge. As such, standardized analytical protocols for these hazardous plastic particles, if established, would help monitor their behavior to safely manage the human health. In this work, critical analysis on the current status, issues, and challenges for future development in the monitoring of MPs and NPs is presented with an emphasis on monitoring of plastic particles in terrestrial (soil/sediment), atmosphere (air), aquatic (marine and freshwater), and biotic systems (model organisms and food webs). Further, an in-depth discussion on multiple methodological approaches for sampling, sample treatment, and preparation (e.g., separation, extraction, and digestion), and analysis (identification, detection, and characterization) of MPs and NPs has been made. The benefits and drawbacks of these approaches are also described to help open the new paths for the efficient monitoring of plastics in various environmental systems.

The authors offer guidance to theorization through literature reviews. The key to theory advancement is consistency between the state of theory and the chosen review type. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual approach is taken. The authors identify shortcomings in literature reviews of logistics and supply chain management (L&SCM) research and develop a framework to aid theorization from literature. Findings: Literature review types are categorized as inductive theory building, contextualized explanations, theory testing and interpretive sensemaking. The authors argue that the effectiveness of a review type depends on the prior state of theory, which ranges from nascent, to intermediate, to mature. The authors propose the interpretive sensemaking review as a novel review type rooted in the interpretive paradigm. Practical implications: This study should be of immediate interest and value to logistics and supply chain management scholars—as well as scholars in other fields—because it offers a pathway to theory development through literature reviews. Appropriate applications of the proposed review types will result in more comprehensive theories. Originality/value: This article lays down arguments for the need to change the way L&SCM scholars use literature reviews.

This study aims to investigate how TMC influences Lean team members’ prosocial voice behaviour and how such changed voice behaviour affects the outcome of Lean implementations. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have used a qualitative research methodology to examine six dimensions of TMC (communication, involvement, support, empowerment, encouragement and monitoring) in two ready-made garment (RMG) factories in Bangladesh. Operational performance was measured by efficiency, quality, value stream mapping, single-minute exchange dies and 5S scores. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) was assessed by acceptable head and back positions, machine safety, use of masks and housekeeping. Findings: The findings reveal that TMC influences Lean team members' voice behaviour positively and, thereby, company's performance. Six dimensions of TMC are all critical for mobilizing prosocial voice, which then improves productivity, OHS and enhancing employee capacity and job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: This research involved two sewing lines in two RMG factories in Bangladesh. Cross-sector and large-scale international quantitative research is also needed. Practical implications: This research shows how TMC and Lean problem-solving teams can mobilize employee voice. Originality/value: Employee voice is a central issue in the implementation of Lean.

This paper aims to present some of the challenges associated with the implementation of the sulfur cap and investigates its possible side effects as regard the drive of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Even though it would appear that the two issues (desulfurization and decarbonization) are unrelated, it turns out that there are important cross-linkages between them, which have not been examined, at least by the regulators. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and a qualitative risk assessment of possible CO2 contributors are presented first. A cost-benefit analysis is then conducted on a specific case study, so as to assess the financial, as well as the environmental impact of two main compliance choices, in terms of CO2 and sulfur oxide. Findings: From a financial perspective, the choice of a scrubber ranks better comparing to a marine gas oil (MGO) choice because of the price difference between MGO and heavy fuel oil. However, and under different price scenarios, the scrubber choice remains sustainable only for big vessels. It is noticed that small containerships cannot outweigh the capital cost of a scrubber investment and are more sensitive in different fuel price scenarios. From an environmental perspective, scrubber ranks better than MGO in the assessment of overall emissions. Research limitations/implications: Fuel price data in this paper was based on 2019 data. As this paper was being written, the COVID-19 pandemic created a significant upheaval in global trade flows, cargo demand and fuel prices. This made any attempt to perform even a rudimentary ex-post evaluation of the 2020 sulfur cap virtually impossible. Due to limited data, such an evaluation would be extremely difficult even under normal circumstances. This paper nevertheless made a brief analysis to investigate possible COVID-19 impacts. Practical implications: The main implication is that the global sulfur cap will increase CO2 emissions. In that sense, this should be factored in the IMO greenhouse gas discussion. Originality/value: According to the knowledge of the authors, no analysis examining the impact of the 2020 sulfur cap on CO2 emissions has yet been conducted in the scientific literature. © 2021, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.","Carbon emissions; CO2 emissions; Cost benefit analysis; Covid-19; Global sulfur cap; Initial IMO strategy; Sulfur emissions; Sulfur legislation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115816753

Design/methodology/approach: For that purpose, we carried out a cognitive ethnographic study in a Danish hospital, where we video-recorded three pre-ward round meetings, five discharge conversations and conducted seven semi-structured interviews. Fieldnotes and interview transcripts were analyzed using the method Cognitive Task Analysis, and video-recordings were analyzed via the interactivity-based approach Cognitive Event Analysis. Findings: Our findings show that practitioners coordinate multi-scalar resources (e.g. verbal patterns and cognitive artifacts) in order to discharge patients in a safe and integrated way, which we propose amounts to the social and intercorporeal ability to align simultaneously emerging factors, like organizational procedures in the hospital, artifacts in use, sociocultural resources and the individual medical expertise of the practitioner in the emerging social interaction with the patient. In pursing this claim, we investigate the linguistic and cognitive processes emerging in a single case study of a nurse who discharges a patient. We propose that the interaction-sensitive skill which enables the nurse to solve the task of discharging the patient can be characterized via hybrid cognition.

What distinguishes ROC from the established research on Organizational Cognition is that it remains faithful to radical, anti-representationalist principles of contemporary cognitive science. However, it is imperative for proponents of ROC to legitimize their approach by considering how it differs from the established research approach of Distributed Cognition (DCog). DCog is a potential contender to ROC in that it not only counters classical approaches to cognition but also provides valuable insights into cognition in organizational settings. Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a conceptual/theoretical approach that expands Secchi and Cowley's introduction of ROC. Findings: The paper shows that DCog research presupposes a task-specification requirement, which entails that cognitive tasks are well-defined. Consequently, DCog research neglects cases of organizational becoming where tasks cannot be clearly demarcated for the or are well-known to the organization. This is the case with the introduction of novel tasks or technical devices. Moreover, the paper elaborates on ROC's 3M model by linking it with insights from the literature on organizational change. Thus, it explores how organizing can be explored as an emergent phenomenon that involves micro, meso and macro domain dynamics, which are shaped by synoptic and performative changes. Originality/value: The present paper explores new grounds for ROC by not only expanding on its core model but also showing its potential for informing organizational theory and radical cognitive science research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","4E cognition; Distributed cognition; Radical organizational cognition; Synoptic and performative change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102955366

Despite the scholars and decision-makers acknowledging the importance of university social responsibility (USR), a review of previous research indicates that on one hand, not much agreement has been reached on the criteria and dimensions proposed by previous conceptual models, and on the other hand, no particular model and framework has yet been introduced to measure USR. The proposed measurement framework must be capable of dealing with large numbers of criteria and dimensions as well as the incomplete and inaccurate university data in this field. Therefore, this study aims to design a model to measure social responsibility in universities. In this survey, the initial model is extracted from the literature review and then presented to the experts to confirm and extract weights for the indicators. The required data for the indicators of the model were collected through various tools and from different groups of stakeholders. Given the Rough Set Theory's ability in dealing with similar situations, it has been used to determine the level of university social responsibility. Besides, this theory provides the chance to predict a university's USR based on the values of conditional variables by providing decision-making principles. The model is applied for the University of Tehran to illustrate the availability and utility of the proposed model in a real-world case. The results show that using the proposed approach, universities can accurately estimate their social responsibility level while they can save time and expense by measuring only a few indicators. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Rough set theory; Social responsibility; University of Tehran; University social responsibility (USR)","Decision making; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Conceptual model; Decision makers; Decisions makings; Literature reviews; Mutual benefit; Real-world; Social responsibilities; University of Tehran; University social responsibility; Rough set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116753329

The first three scenarios were based on real full-scale processes in Scandinavia, furthermore two original biorefinery scenarios for carboxylates and biogas production were proposed. Data from the actual plant of one scenario was used in order to calibrate the simulation, creating five realistic models for sludge valorization. Two downstream technologies were simulated for the valorization of carboxylates: anion exchange chromatography and biological separation (through PHA production). Even though none of the models was profitable without subsidies, the biorefinery scenario with biological separation was the most promising one, with the operating costs (2.79 million €) closest to the total revenues (0.8 million €). The use of anion exchange chromatography created an economic bottleneck in the model (57% of the operating costs), suggesting the need for more simple and cost-effective downstream technologies, when developing biorefineries for the valorization of waste streams. Moreover, the importance of public subsidies, gate fees for organic wastes and the amount of treated material were found to be key aspects for the economic feasibility of these facilities treating waste, increasing the total revenues between 2 and 15 times, depending on the modelled scenario. © 2021","Anaerobic digestion; Biorefinery; Carboxylates; PHA; Sewage sludge; Techno-economic analysis","Carboxylation; Chromatography; Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Operating costs; Refining; Sewage sludge; Sludge digestion; Anion exchange chromatography; Biorefineries; Codigestion; Down-stream; Organic wastes; PHA; Scandinavia; Techno-Economic analysis; Total revenue; Valorisation; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116592941

The great differences across such DQ classifications (DQCs) imply a lack of clarity about what DQ is. For an improved foundation for future research, this paper aims to clarify the ways in which DQCs differ and provide guidelines for dealing with this variance. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review identifies DQCs in conference and journal articles, which are analyzed to reveal the types of differences across these. On this basis, guidelines for future research are developed. Findings: The literature review found 110 unique DQCs in journals and conference articles. The analysis of these articles identified seven distinct types of differences across DQCs. This gave rise to the development of seven guidelines for future DQ research. Research limitations/implications: By identifying differences across DQCs and providing a set of guidelines, this paper may promote that future research, to a greater extent, will converge around common understandings of DQ. Practical implications: Awareness of the identified types of differences across DQCs may support managers when planning and conducting DQ improvement projects.

International market expansion offers huge opportunities for companies to increase their revenue, but there are also challenging tasks such as the establishment of a business company and the occupation of a strategic position abroad. Practitioners consider this process as the act of incubation, but the theoretical discussion lags behind the practice-led debate. Design/methodology/approach: An illustrative, and theory-led, case study is presented that describes market expansion to BRIC countries through a network-based IBI. The empirical case is an illustrative Danish company with international operations in BRIC countries both with and without an IBI. Findings: International business incubation represents a process, which can be influenced through an IBI, and business networking during foreign market entry is shaped by IBI brokerage (bridging, bonding and protecting) in different phases. IBI activities that are embedded in business networking support a company’s endeavours in getting a foothold and acquiring a strategic position in BRIC markets and facilitates the market penetration. Research limitations/implications: The IBI’s activities to enter foreign markets should be thoroughly managed. Further studies should be conducted with cross-case comparisons and larger samples to reflect on the propositions established. Originality/value: By linking the business networking theory with the practice-led understanding of business incubation, the study explores an under-conceptualised topic for international business and entrepreneurship scholars.

Design/methodology/approach: Employing a multiple case study design, the authors examine 38 student teams from three different entrepreneurship courses with different team formation paths to uncover potential links between team formation and learning outcomes. Findings: The authors find that team formation mode matters. Randomly assigned teams, while diverse, struggle with handling uncertainty and feedback from potential stakeholders. In contrast, student self-selected teams are less diverse but more robust in handling this pressure. Results suggest that in randomly assigned teams, the entrepreneurial project becomes the team's sole reference point for well-being. Seeking to protect the project, the team's ability to deal with uncertainty and external feedback is limited, stifling development. In student self-select teams, team well-being becomes a discrete reference point. This enables these teams to respond effectively to external project feedback while nurturing team well-being independently. Originality/value: Education theories' implications about the benefit of team diversity may not apply to experiential learning-based entrepreneurship education's typical level of ambiguity and uncertainty. Therefore, educators may have to reconsider the unique dynamics of team formation strategies to ensure strong teamwork and teamwork outcomes. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship education; Higher education; Reference points; Team formation; Teamwork",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113871795

Thus, the present paper contributes to the small but growing literature analyzing local FVCs by providing and analyzing quantitative survey data. More specifically, the authors aim at investigating (1) how agricultural producers and processors define and perceive local food, (2) which drivers are important for the decision to become involved in local FVC and (3) whether these drivers differ in a systematic way across producers and processors. Design/methodology/approach: In order to address these research questions, empirical data from a quantitative stakeholder survey carried out in spring in 2017 is used. Data are analyzed via descriptive and inductive statistics including a cluster analysis. Findings: The survey results concerning the definition and perceptions of local food are in line with previous studies showing that there is usually a strong emphasis on geographic proximity. Besides, local (organic) food producers and processors are diverse and heterogeneous with differing distribution and product differentiation strategies being implemented and pursued. In particular, businesses employing primarily a personified distribution strategy (e.g. direct sales via farmers markets) differ quite substantially from businesses employing mainly a standardized distribution strategy (e.g. via retail) in their economic characteristics. Moreover, differences in the perception of potential benefits of local food as well as in the underlying drivers to become part of local FVCs were detected across businesses with different distribution strategies. Research limitations/implications: Although the employed data sample is considered adequate for analyzing heterogeneity in firms' business strategies, the sample is not representative for Denmark and cannot straight-forwardly be extrapolated to the population level. Originality/value: One of the first quantitative study on producers' and processors' perceptions of local food and its interaction with organic farming. So far, there is a large literature on consumers' perceptions but empirical evidence for other stakeholders is scarce. Hence, the present study provides a complementary perspective on the topic of local food. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Concept of proximity; Local food; Organic food; Producer perceptions","article; cluster analysis; consumer; Denmark; farmers market; human; organic farming; organic food; perception; quantitative analysis; spring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106262035

Events in state space are classified into risky and ambiguous events, which correspond to different types of uncertainty generated by different sources. In this TSE model, uncertainty of two different types are evaluated by decision maker (DM) in different stages. In the first stage, DM evaluates more uncertain consequences of an act locally by applying local subjective expected utility (SEU) models, which are then embedded into the second-stage evaluation based on SEU defined globally over all events. To axiomatize such a model, the small domain SEU over risky acts is extended to both risky and nonrisky (ambiguous) acts. When evaluating a risky act, TSE model reduces to Savage's SEU with one stage. When evaluating an ambiguous act, local SEU with a different uncertainty aversion defined on ambiguous events gives TSE model some flexibility in describing preferences. It can be shown that TSE model can accommodate Ellsberg's paradoxes and Machina's paradoxes in the literature. When applied to portfolio selection problem, TSE model enjoys some nice properties other models do not have. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Before this background, we examine how innovation practices such as open innovation and dominant design impact innovation performance, particularly in the case of digital innovation. We develop a theoretical framework that is tested on a long panel of patent data for 788 technologies over 32 years. Open innovation has no impact on the innovative performance of technologies in general, but for digital innovation, we find a positive effect. In addition, dominant design has a stronger impact on the innovative performance for digital innovations than for other innovations. We conclude that the management of digital innovation is different from that of other innovations since both open innovation and dominant design are more important for innovative performance. Indeed, some of the benefits of openness may only apply to digital innovation. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Digital innovation; dominant design; innovation performance; open innovation; patents; standardisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121268457

Yet, a review of the disparate literatures on rural venturing reveals that this research has largely escaped the attention of management and entrepreneurship scholars. Our analysis suggests that scholarly progress has been forestalled by three interconnected research practices: gap-spotting scholarship, decontextualized theory-building, and an allegiance to binary oppositions. In response to the challenges posed by these practices, this article identifies three alternative, multiparadigmatic research tools to enhance the effectiveness of management scholars in contributing to multidisciplinary fields of inquiry such as rural entrepreneurship: problematization, hybridization, and contextualization. Through the application of these tools, we develop new avenues to consider the complex interplay between community, space, and place; novel innovation pathways; the power of traditional values and contexts; and the varied nature of modern business venturing. Our work also contributes fresh perspectives on the manner in which management scholars can offer more effective conceptual leadership in multidisciplinary fields to theorize complex phenomena.

Concern has been raised, however, as to their ‘black box’ nature, in which calculations are so complex they are difficult to understand and independently verify. In considering the use of ML in healthcare, we divide the question of transparency into three different scenarios: 1) Solely automated decisions. We suggest these will be unusual in healthcare, as Article 22(4) of the General Data Protection Regulation presents a high bar. However, if solely automatic decisions are made (e.g. for inpatient triage), data subjects will have a right to ‘meaningful information’ about the logic involved. 2) Clinical decisions. These are decisions made ultimately by clinicians—such as diagnosis—and the standard of transparency under the GDPR is lower due to this human mediation. 3) Patient decisions. Decisions about treatment are ultimately taken by the patient or their representative, albeit in dialogue with clinicians. Here, the patient will require a personalised level of medical information, depending on the severity of the risk, and how much they wish to know.In the final category of decisions made by patients, we suggest European healthcare law sets a more personalised standard of information requirement than the GDPR. Clinical information must be tailored to the individual patient according to their needs and priorities; there is no monolithic ‘explanation’ of risk under healthcare law. When giving advice based (even partly) on a ML model, clinicians must have a sufficient grasp of the medically-relevant factors involved in the model output to offer patients this personalised level of medical information. We use the UK, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden as examples of European health law jurisdictions which require this personalised transparency to support patients’ rights to make informed choices. This adds to the argument for post-hoc, rationale explanations of ML to support healthcare decisions in all three scenarios. © 2021 Miranda Mourby, Katharina Ó Cathaoir, Catherine Bjerre Collin","Clinical decision support software; Explanations; Healthcare; Machine-Learning; Patients’ rights; Transparency","Bioinformatics; Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Machine learning; Medical informatics; Patient treatment; Black boxes; Clinical decision support; Clinical decision support software; Decision support software; Explanation; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Medical information; Patient choice; Patient’ right; Transparency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118869912

Most universities use accepted lists of top-tier journals, citation counts, or other metrics to assess the value of research contributions. We first explore the metrics by which research contributions are evaluated. These metrics provide at least some indication of the impact and value of an academic's stream of research. We then consider the issue of value beyond the commonly accepted metrics of article counts and citations. Should high-quality research create value for students and, especially in the case of business academics, for managers and practitioners? If so, rather than focusing exclusively on theoretical contributions, researchers should demonstrate the value-in-use of the research stream to the broader community. We present a set of conditions to support a research stream that delivers value-in-use to students and practitioners. We then turn to whether high-quality research implies finding solutions to societal challenges and problems. This would require a rethinking of the traditional views on the university's relationship with society at large. We explore issues of research concerning its contribution to society. We conclude by distilling these issues into several pieces of advice to new and mid-career academics regarding strategies and challenges in developing high-quality research. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Citations; Clarivate™ web of science; DORA; Effectuation logic; Field weighted citation impact; H-index; Journal rankings; Observation-bridge-challenge model; REEAD model; Research quality; Stanford University composite index; UK REF",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118278692

In recent years, the sustainability of shipping has become a public concern, and various emissions control regulations to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from ships have been proposed and implemented globally. These regulations aim to drive the shipping industry in a low-carbon and low-pollutant direction by motivating it to switch to more efficient fuel types and reduce energy consumption. At the same time, the cyclical downturn of the world economy and high bunker prices make it necessary and urgent for the shipping industry to operate in a more cost-effective way while still satisfying global trade demand. As bunker fuel bunker (e.g., heavy fuel oil [HFO], liquified natural gas [LNG]) consumption is the main source of emissions and bunker fuel costs account for a large proportion of operating costs, shipping companies are making unprecedented efforts to optimize ship energy efficiency. It is widely accepted that the key to improving the energy efficiency of ships is the development of accurate models to predict ship fuel consumption rates under different scenarios. In this study, ship fuel consumption prediction models presented in the literature (including the academic literature and technical reports as a typical type of “grey literature”) are reviewed and compared, and models that optimize ship operations based on fuel consumption prediction results are also presented and discussed.

Instead, they express different degrees of focus on various parameters of sustainability, thereby shaping the actors' ‘sustainability DNA’. The analysis shows how different DNAs are incommensurable and that this limits nature tourism development. The incommensurability arises from underlying ontological beliefs about sustainability, including the reasons for which sustainability is included in organisational strategies.

Mystery shoppers had a service encounter with an employee across a set of physical commercial settings that were classified according to their gender image. The mystery shoppers noted the gender of the employee, provided employee evaluations, and indicated word-of-mouth (WOM) ratings. Shoppers who had a gender congruent service encounter (e.g., a female employee in a “feminine” consumption context) reported more favorable employee evaluations and WOM ratings than shoppers who had a gender incongruent service encounter (e.g., a female employee in a “masculine” consumption context), with the impact of gender congruency on WOM ratings mediated by employee evaluations, particularly with respect to competence inferences. These findings highlight the ethical dilemma of a positive gender congruency effect, as it can generate superior consumer responses but also risks resulting in gender occupational segregation. © 2021 The Author(s)","Congruency; Employee evaluations; Femininity; Gender; Gender equality; Gendered marketing; Masculinity; Processing fluency; Stereotypes; Word-of-mouth","cultural identity; cultural influence; feminism; gender relations; masculinization; womens employment; womens status",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113298491

MPCs aim to relate financial and operational concerns by sensitising operators to the financial consequences of their actions and by triggering financial improvements. MPCs, however, also create many small interdependent responsibility centres, which makes it difficult to delegate financial accountability. The paper studies the dynamic construction of relations between financial and operational concerns when structural interdependencies are important. It analyses such construction as a process of mediation. While extant studies focus on how accounting calculations, as mediating instruments, help linking dispersed people, aspirations and domains, the paper studies how accounting requires itself to be mediated to relate financial and operational concerns and to become powerful. It shows that people, spaces and instruments form a heterogeneous ‘web of mediators’ by which relations between accounting and operations are constructed. It shows how structural interdependencies take part in this mediation of relations. Finally, this study shows that mediation does not link, but transforms mediated entities including accounting, which forms, per-forms and trans-forms along the chain of mediation it helps constituting. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Interdependencies; Mediating instruments; Mediation; Micro-profit centres; Web of mediators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112740320

This paper contextualizes its research within the theoretical literature of smart cities, innovation, knowledge management, and governance and compares 17 smart city pilot projects in North America, Europe, and Asia. The cases were selected according to the research objective and analyzed using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings show two paths of city-wide scale-up, which we term “bureaucratic tailoring” and “low-uncertainty partnering.” This article makes three important theoretical contributions. First, it is possible for smart city pilot projects to scale-up to an entire city through different paths. Second, differentiating the role and capabilities of the municipality in terms of these different paths and in relation to the other governance conditions is essential. Third, the social perception of technological uncertainty is not static but fluid, and is highly related to other governance conditions. Future-oriented policy makers might find the paths explained here useful for anticipating how projects might scale-up. © 2021","Governance; Grand challenges; Innovation diffusion; Mission innovation; Smart city; Transformative innovation","Knowledge management; Public policy; Condition; Governance; Grand Challenge; Innovations diffusion; Mission innovation; Pilot projects; Project governance; Research objectives; Scale-up; Transformative innovation; Smart city; governance approach; innovation; knowledge; perception; project management; smart city; technology diffusion; Asia; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111316727

Urban metabolism, which mimics metabolism of organisms as both require material and energy to function and further generate waste and emissions, is a useful framework to analyze levels of sustainability of a city through quantification of material and energy flows it uses and discards. The present study quantifies and compares the metabolic patterns of the four main Danish cities, Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense, and Aalborg, from 2010 and 2015. We found their inflows of energy, water, and food and outflows of greenhouse gas emissions, wastewater, municipal solid waste, and construction and demolition waste have downsized over the six years. Our results affirm the impact of relevant policy and regulations in urban sustainability, with Danish cities showing more sustainable metabolic patterns than other world megacities previously reported in the literature. They also indicate that urban metabolic patterns can be highly dependent on the role and services that a city offers to its surrounding region (as a multicellular organism). Further strengthening of policies and regulations on “cities for sustainability” (i.e., focus on the sustainability of the entire multicellular organism) instead of a sole focus on “sustainable city” (i.e., each cell aiming at being sustainable independently from the others) would be important. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Denmark; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Resource use; Urban metabolism","municipal solid waste; policy approach; quantitative analysis; regulatory framework; resource use; sustainability; sustainable development; urban area; waste management; Aalborg; Aarhus [Midtjylland]; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Fyn; Hovedstaden; Midtjylland; Nordjylland; Odense; Syddanmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111247290

Yet, the research has evolved in parallel streams, and scholars have used CEO tenure as a proxy for various aspects of CEO givens and behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to consolidate, assess, and integrate the extant knowledge about CEO tenure from the fields of management and accounting/finance and, on that basis, stimulate future research. Research Findings/Insights: Our review reveals five key themes in CEO tenure research that have been studied across the management and accounting/finance fields: (1) CEO tenure and motivations; (2) CEO tenure and power; (3) CEO tenure and social capital; (4) CEO tenure and human capital; and (5) CEO tenure and stakeholder perceptions. We review the extant research along these research themes, highlighting the collective insights, contributions, and shortcomings within and between these themes. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our review suggests that CEO tenure is a multifaceted, complex construct. To advance extant knowledge, we propose three pathways for future research: (1) substantiating knowledge within themes; (2) expanding knowledge across themes; and (3) advancing knowledge about temporal dynamics. We hope that research along those lines will help foster a richer and deeper understanding of the dynamic and complex nature of CEO tenure, which will also advance our understanding about CEOs in general. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our study offers a comprehensive understanding of the nature of CEO tenure and its implications. Such an understanding can be leveraged to define appropriate policies and governance decisions that account for the dynamic nature of the CEO position. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CEO tenure; chief executive officer; corporate governance; strategic leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110566147

Through a comparative analysis of Research and Innovation (R&I) instrument choices in countries characterized by different paradigmatic models of policy (Italy and France), the paper investigates how the politics of different cabinets influence the formulation of national R&I strategies and the extent to which these decisions are constrained by the legacy of previous choices. By capitalizing on a new proposed treatment of policy instruments, the paper contributes to the definition of the types of tools found in policy mixes, investigating how national R&I instrument mix variations develop. The results of the analysis indicate how the selection of R&I policy instruments does not closely follow traditional left versus right-wing political cleavages, and their evolution is generally influenced by a combination of different context-dependent dynamics. However, when partisan acceptance of consolidated R&I instrument mixes across cabinets is present, this triggers a consolidating effect on path-dependency forces. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Instrument mix; Politics of instrument choices; Qualitative Content Analysis; Research & Innovation Policy","Combined effect; Comparative analysis; Context dependent; Instrument choices; Instrument mix; Paradigmatic models; Path dependency; Policy instruments; Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110382067

While extant research primarily examined it in the context of affluent consumer segments, the sharing economy may offer opportunities for consumers at the base of the economic pyramid, where ownership risks prevent access to products that could create societal benefits. Drawing from risk perception theory, we examine how access-based services, as an alternative to ownership, can mitigate perceived risk dimensions. An experimental study reveals that, in contrast to consumers with higher income, low-income consumers perceive access-based services to entail less financial risk, resulting in a greater inclination to access a good than to own it. In a second study, we explore these differences by comparing access with a risk mitigation strategy. We find that at the base of the pyramid, access is perceived to entail less financial risk than both ownership and ownership with a warranty. The results indicate the importance of the sharing economy for addressing the limited availability of resources for alleviating poverty.

Although the advantages of teams for innovating are virtually undisputed, we have only a very rudimentary understanding of their success drivers. To shed more light on innovation teams, we conceptualize multiplicity in expertise as nonredundant expertise and distinguish it from factors that facilitate or hinder the integration of this expertise. These factors are overlap in expertise, disparity in team members’ status, and whether or not teams use automation technology. We use the empirical context of molecular biology, especially the part of this field in which teams produce and exchange genetic material in the form of so-called plasmids. Combining data about plasmids from a central plasmid repository (AddGene) with bibliometric data endows us with a rich dataset capturing information about team diversity in addition to two innovation performance measures (the number of plasmid orders and the number of citations attracted by publications). Our analysis shows that multiplicity in expertise increases innovation performance; this relationship is strengthened by the overlap in expertise and weakened by disparity in status and the use of the automation technology. Our paper provides a more detailed theory of expertise diversity and contributes to the diversity literature.

Catholic Christian Democrats framed the unification of Europe as a relatively exclusionary cultural-civilizational endeavour, while Protestant Christian Democrats favoured a more inclusive conception of Europe that prioritised free trade over cultural homogeneity. Focusing specifically on Germany, we suggest that the eventual resolution of the intra-party struggle between the two camps in the early 1970s was a crucial enabler for including more and more countries into the European project.

Research Findings/Insights: Using a panel data set of US listed firms, we find that a greater inequality in executive pay is positively associated with the exit of female executives from the firm's top executive team. This effect is economically larger when the starting level of female representation in the executive team is low, when the firm uses more variable compensation to reward executives, and when the firm operates in geographic areas featuring stronger aversion toward income inequality. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Our study expands existing knowledge on the organizational and external factors promoting gender diversity at the top of companies. Although this literature has widely analyzed women's entry into corporate positions, exit has been largely neglected. Our study fills this gap by documenting significant gender differences in the relationship between executives' pay inequality and exit from the top executive team. In so doing, we connect the literatures on gender diversity and executive pay distribution, which have developed in a rather independent manner. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Drawing on insights from corporate governance and behavioral economics, this study offers novel evidence to policy-makers interested in addressing the under-explored challenges associated with the retention of women in corporate positions and their upward mobility within the corporate hierarchy. Moreover, the contextual variations behind our main finding suggest that cultural values and norms may play a key role in shaping the effectiveness of public policies aimed at increasing diversity in corporate governance positions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","corporate governance; executives; exit; gender; pay inequality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106731068

We couple qualitative data (observations from 150 counterfeit sales points worldwide, two focus groups, a survey with 151 respondents, interviews with 90 informants) with econometric analysis of 3,333 fights the focal firm undertook against more than 2,000 counterfeiters in 75 countries over 6 years (2006–2011). We focus on firm's seizure of counterfeit products when consumers' safety is at risk. As the firm is more sensitive to product safety than counterfeiters, we found that the firm generally performs larger seizures when unsafe products are involved, but this is less true in the firm's main market, likely because higher profitability offers higher incentives to counterfeiters. Managerial Summary: In companies' fight against counterfeiters, product safety plays a pivotal role. We suggest that companies have a particularly high incentive to seize counterfeit products when the product carries potential safety risks, because the occurrence of safety issues seriously harms its reputation. This research explores the anti-counterfeit strategy undertaken by a large manufacturer operating in the market of mobile phones and in the market of ancillary products (e.g., batteries and chargers). Results show that larger seizures occur in the ancillary rather than in the mobile phone market because while authentic companies have high incentives to seize mobile phone and accessories, as both involve safety risks, counterfeiters have a greater incentive in the main market and thus put less effort in ancillary markets. © 2021 The Authors.

Besides, in order to capture dynamic interaction between yield curve and macroeconomic/financial factors, a panel vector autoregressive (VAR) analysis based on the system generalized method of moments (GMM) approach is utilized. Empirical results suggest that the level factor responds to shocks originated from inflation, domestic financial variables, and global variables. Furthermore, the slope factor is affected by shocks in global variables, and the curvature factor appears to be influenced by domestic financial variables.

Drawing on the practice theory, we seek to uncover how participation in such practices might enhance users’ well-being as an integral part of social sustainability. We assume that both ageing and well-being are not pre-given but they rather co-evolve when users of wearables engage in situated practices. Hence, wearables such as smartwatches and fitness trackers might positively reconfigure the existing practices of consumers over 50, or even recruit them into new ones, resulting in higher well-being and social sustainability. The phenomenon is examined in Russia and Finland, as ageing has been high on the agenda in these countries due to controversial pension and social welfare reforms. Though these countries are different in terms of possibilities (access to medical help, employment, social participation and so forth) for their ageing populations, an active ageing framework with an emphasis on individual responsibility over one’s well-being has been gaining popularity in both Russia and Finland. This framework is compatible with the use of wearable devices that measure physical activity and basic health characteristics. Based on data elicited through 17 semi-structured interviews with Russians and Finns aged between 50 and 73 y.o., this study suggests that engagement in practices with wearables might have a positive effect on consumers’ well-being. This is achieved, for instance, by helping manage one’s daily tasks, reducing stigma that is sometimes attached to ageing individuals and/or boosting feeling of togetherness in social interactions that might decrease with ageing. In addition, an important difference between the two countries lies in how ageing consumers see themselves in relation to other ageing people when using a wearable: in Russia, the use of a wearable can signal one’s social distance from an “average” ageing person, while Finnish consumers regard themselves as doing what everyone of the same age does. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","50+ consumers; practice theory; wearable technology; well-being",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100551231

These variables remain underexplored as empirical objects of analysis on a company level in the financial sector. By applying a case study research strategy, 100 launched financial service innovations’ performance is compared with qualitative data assessing flexibility and complexity in the project work, leading to the launch of these products into the marketplace by a major Danish financial company. Finally, these data are quantitatively tested with a multinomial logit model. The results contribute to the differing views on how regulations influence innovation by showing links between high flexibility and low complexity in firm response for improved innovation performance.

By referring to ‘advanced structural’ internationalization, we want to distinguish between what might be broadly defined as internationalization at home and internationalization abroad, which we consider ‘structural’. ‘Advanced structural’ precisely because it involves transporting and re-engineering relations with governments, partners, students and other stakeholders and tends to be high risk, high commitment, and high cost. We ‘look’ at ‘advanced structural’ internationalization through the theoretical lenses of university autonomy. Since there is limited research at the intersection of international business and university autonomy, along with our experience, we draw on publicly available data relating to issues and challenges which arise from the pursuit of ‘advanced structural’ internationalization in higher education to construct an analytical narrative and ethical discourse appropriate to the radically changing structural, theoretical, and ideological realities we now face in this field. ‘Advanced structural’ internationalization poses serious ethical questions, which suggest that it does not have strong ethical foundations. In this conclusion, we are influenced by the degree of difference between university autonomy settings at home and the operation in the host country. The greater the disparity the more it is likely that the standards and practices which would be applied in the home environment fail to apply in the host. Hence, our thesis: ‘advanced structural’ internationalization of universities is unethical. © The Author(s) 2020.","Advanced structural internationalization; de-internationalization; ethics; higher education; international business; university autonomy; university internationalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096233009

We draw on Foucault’s notion of pastoral power to argue that these quasi-therapeutic practices help to produce and to normalize what we describe as a confessional culture of leadership development that prepares would-be student leaders to submit themselves to similarly or even more psychologically demanding regimes of governmentality in the workplace after they graduate. We conclude with a call for future research on the central role of such leadership development practices—and the institutions, industries, and actors that promote them—in folding together the ways that individuals seek to claim agency and to develop themselves as leaders with the ways that organizations function to constrain that agency and to govern them as willing but compliant subjects. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Critical leadership studies; Higher education; Leadership development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087561177

One crucial question is the impact that the purpose of a loan—either business investment or basic necessities—may have on the success of a campaign. Investigating a prosocial crowdfunding platform, we find that loans taken out to meet basic needs are funded faster than business-related loans, especially for small amounts, which can be explained by the prosocial motivation of microlenders. Moreover, female microborrowers are funded faster than men, especially for basic needs loans. Our results therefore suggest an ethical blind spot, since prosocially motivated crowdlenders may unintentionally end up producing adverse effects, replicating gender role by supporting women to a lesser extent when they apply for business loans.

Consequently, the role of social relations and practical understandings embodied in humans has been downplayed. We give two possible explanations to this rather one-sided focus; first, a general focus within social sciences on rethinking the role of the material in the wake of the cultural turn and second, engagement with science and technology studies. In this article, we use Bourdieu’s theoretical framework and his concept of habitus to (re)introduce embodied practical understandings to the sociology of sustainable consumption. By showing interconnections between the perspective focusing on practical understandings embodied in systems of dispositions and the perspective focusing on practical understandings embedded in systems of material entities, the article provides a basis for applying both perspectives to better understand the complexity of sustainable consumption practices and how they reproduce and change. Accordingly, we encourage more studies focusing on how sustainable consumption practices reproduce and transmit through social interaction. © The Author(s) 2019.","Bourdieu; habitus; practical understandings; practice theory; sustainable consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067650823

In particular, we aim to maximize the total number of the allocated tasks while minimizing the average allocated task number difference. To solve the problem, we propose a two-phase framework, called Task Allocation with Geographic Partition, consisting of a geographic partition phase and a task allocation phase. The first phase is to divide the whole study area based on the allocation centers by using both a basic Voronoi diagram-based algorithm and an adaptive weighted Voronoi diagram-based algorithm. In the allocation phase, we utilize a Reinforcement Learning method to achieve the task allocation, where a graph neural network with the attention mechanism is used to learn the embeddings of allocation centers, delivery points and workers. Extensive experiments give insight into the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed solutions. © 2021 ACM.","geographic partition; reinforcement learning; spatial crowdsourcing; task allocation","Computational geometry; Crowdsourcing; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Reinforcement learning; Allocation phasis; Allocation problems; Center-based; Geographic partition; Geographics; Mobile connectivity; Multiple allocation; Spatial crowdsourcing; Task allocation; Two phase; Graph neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119201296

In this paper, we propose an authentication scheme for centerpoint queries, grounded on the algorithm for centerpoint queries on a finite planar set of points and authenticated aggregation R-trees and accompanying authenticated aggregation queries. We also provide methods for finding the centerpoint of a subset of the complete data set, and implement a range-based method. Our solution has a worst-case time-complexity of O(n log n) and space-complexity of O(n). Our experimental study confirms these claims. © 2021 ACM.","centerpoint query; query authentication","Authentication; Digital storage; Query processing; Authentication scheme; Centerpoint query; Geometric queries; Map service; Online maps; Query authentications; Query results; Service drives; Spatial data; Spatial queries; Decision trees",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119198531

Several methods extend this type of evaluation beyond relevance, making it possible to evaluate different aspects of a document ranking (e.g., relevance, usefulness, or credibility) using a single measure (multi-aspect evaluation). However, these methods either are (i) tailor-made for specific aspects and do not extend to other types or numbers of aspects, or (ii) have theoretical anomalies, e.g. assign maximum score to a ranking where all documents are labelled with the lowest grade with respect to all aspects (e.g., not relevant, not credible, etc.). We present a theoretically principled multi-aspect evaluation method that can be used for any number, and any type, of aspects. A thorough empirical evaluation using up to 5 aspects and a total of 425 runs officially submitted to 10 TREC tracks shows that our method is more discriminative than the state-of-the-art and overcomes theoretical limitations of the state-of-the-art. © 2021 Owner/Author.","evaluation; multiple aspects; partial order; ranking","Document ranking; Evaluation; Evaluation measures; Maximum score; Multi aspects; Multiple aspect; Partial order; Ranking; Retrieval evaluation; State of the art; Search engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119194348

In particular, our model assumes that information propagates from one user to another if both users are interested in the topic and ideologically aligned with each other. To infer the parameters of our model, we devise a gradient-based optimization procedure maximizing the likelihood of an observed set of information cascades.

Harmful content in the form of hate speech causes a person distress or harm, having a negative impact on the individual mental health, with even more detrimental effects on the psychology of children and teenagers. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution with real-time capabilities to detect harmful content in real-time and mitigate its spread over the network. Our main contribution is Sparse Shield, a novel method that out-scales existing state-of-the-art methods for network immunization. We also propose a novel architecture for harmful speech mitigation that maximizes the impact of immunization. Our solution aims to identify a set of users for which to move harmful content at the bottom of the user feed, rather than censoring users. By immunizing certain network nodes in this manner, we minimize the negative impact on the network and minimize the interference with and limitation of individual freedoms: the information is not hidden but rather not as easy to reach without an explicit search. Our analysis is based on graphs built on real-world data collected from Twitter; these graphs reflect real user behavior. We perform extensive scalability experiments to prove the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art network immunization techniques. We also perform extensive experiments to showcase that Sparse Shield outperforms existing techniques on the task of harmful speech mitigation on a real-world dataset. © 2021 ACM.","counteractive immunization; harmful speech detection; network immunization; preventive immunization","Behavioral research; Fake detection; Immunization; Social networking (online); Speech communication; Speech recognition; Counteractive immunization; End-to-end solutions; Harmful speech detection; Mental health; Network immunizations; Online platforms; Preventive immunization; Real time capability; Social media; Speech detection; Speech",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119170304

This paper explains the mechanisms by which brand denigration occurs, introducing and validating a model of the animosity transfer process as well as considering if various framing and timing strategies attenuate or lead to adverse consumer responses. Design/methodology/approach: Study 1 tests the animosity transfer model, utilizing a scenario in which English consumers respond to a German brand sponsoring the England soccer team. Study 2 assesses the generalizability of the model in the context of Indian consumers' responses to sponsorship of their cricket team by a Chinese company, and the extent to which an honest framing of the sponsorship choice through the announcement affects outcomes. Study 3 returns to an England–Germany country dyad, testing whether priming consumers with information about the sponsorship prior to a full announcement, attenuates or intensifies the impact of animosity on the studied outcomes. Findings: The three studies demonstrate that when consumers learn of a sponsorship, it triggers an evaluation process in which the agonistic emotion (anger) they feel plays a pivotal role. More intense emotional appraisals weaken perceptions of sponsor-sponsee congruence, which together act as consecutive process variables mediating the relationship between animosity and sponsorship outcomes. Framing the sponsorship announcement with an honest justification for the partnership can improve outcomes but not amongst those with the highest animosity. Providing consumers with an advanced warning (preannouncement) of the sponsorship also amplifies consumers' unfavorable evaluations showcasing how difficult animosity is to manage in this context. Originality/value: The animosity transfer model aids understanding of the mechanisms by which animosity affects brand attitude for foreign (out-group) sponsors. It identifies how animosity generates agonistic emotions and in turn weakens perceived fit between the sponsor and sponsee, leading to adverse consumer responses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agonistic emotion; Animosity; Attitude; Fit; Framing; Sponsorship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111971059

Design/methodology/approach: Online surveys carried out in Denmark (Study 1), Germany and France (Study 2; N˜500 from each country). In Study 1, we develop an environmental country image instrument and investigate its nomological validity vis-à-vis other country image constructs and Danish consumers' evaluation of organic milk from Germany. In Study 2, we validate the instrument with consumers from Germany and France, evaluating organic milk from Denmark. Findings: Consumers differentiate between a country's environmental image and its general and production-related images. The country's environmental image is important to consumers' evaluation of an environmentally differentiated product from the country. Specifically, we find that a country's environmental image strongly influences its product-specific images and, through these, the consumer's evaluation of an organic food product from the country. Practical implications: Consumers' use of a country's environmental image as a cue to the credibility of environmental claims gives competitive advantages to exporters from countries with a favorable environmental image, while exporters from countries with an unfavorable environmental image need measures to compensate. Companies and countries should monitor how the environmental image of their country evolves in important markets and be ready to act when facing damages to their country's environmental image.

A certain degree of standardization is necessary so that firms are able to focus on process innovations that make the technology accessible to the masses. In this context, this paper studies how technological centrality and home bias in the innovation process influence the emergence of dominant designs in the mobility sector. An analysis of over 5000 electric-vehicle innovations shows that technological centrality hinders a dominant design from emerging. However, a bias in favor of innovations from the home continent mitigates this negative effect. Thus, innovations from East Asia do not consider European and U.S. innovations and vice versa. East Asian firms are different from both European and North American firms in how home bias affects the emergence of dominant designs. In East Asia, home bias has more impact on the emergence of dominant designs for central technologies than in other continents, while it has less impact for other technologies. Home bias is hence not only a firm-level mechanism, but also a helpful construct for the study of innovation systems. A lack of international standard cooperation might further influence future managerial and governmental decisions fostering developments towards cleaner technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dominant design; Electric vehicle; EV; Home bias; Innovation; Internal combustion engine; Standardization; Technology diffusion","Electric vehicles; Environmental technology; Internal combustion engines; Dominant design; East Asia; EV; Home bias; Innovation; Innovation system; Innovations process; Process Innovation; Technology diffusion; Vehicle industry; Standardization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115339200

While inter-firm learning (e.g., imitation) helps the focal firm adapt in the process of conformity, intra-firm learning (e.g., independent experimentation) helps a firm stand out from rivals in the process of differentiation, both of which can gain competitive advantages. This study investigates how the conformity-differentiation balance can be achieved from the cross-level learning perspective. Adopting a mixed-method design, we first conduct a case study on the Chinese photovoltaic industry. The case suggests that firms are inclined to conform in upstream and bottleneck technological domains but differentiate in the downstream market applications. We then extend the case findings through a computational simulation based on March's learning model. When experimentation and imitation are possible, the balance between conformity and differentiation can be reframed as the classical balance between exploitation and exploration across the firm and industry levels: while experimentation is often exploitative at the firm level but exploratory at the industry level, imitation is often exploratory at the firm level but exploitative at the industry level. The study makes a new attempt to bridge the optimal distinctiveness literature with the organizational learning literature. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

In recent decades, population growth, migration from rural to urban areas, industrialization, and climate change have increasingly jeopardized the sustainability of cities, especially in developing countries, including Iran. The purpose of this study is to assess recent and future perspectives for urban water security in Iran. To do so, the paper extends previous water security studies within the region by collecting data on urban water security from a cohort of cities rather than a single location. To assess the state of water security in the recent past, from 2013 to 2019, we introduce a dedicated framework comprised of five dimensions and twelve indicators. In estimating future water resources for Iran in the period up to 2100, ensemble-based hydro-climatic regional climate model projections for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 were analyzed in time and space. The results show that four of the five dimensions of present-day urban water security, including accessibility, availability, water health and sanitation, and the economic value of water, all demonstrate general improvements in water-related urban infrastructure, whereas the environmental indicator depicts a decreasing trend. Future projected trends for Iran's hydro-climate show a general decline in its net availability from already scarce conditions and also increased variability due to climate change. In general, the study indicates both advances in Iran's urban water security recently and severe implications for future water availability in certain regions and periods in the decades to come. The study also advises policymakers to seek to mitigate the water crisis in so far, as also enforced by climate change, by increasing the appropriate infrastructure and using new technologies in the water and wastewater industry. © 2021","Climate change; Iran; Urban areas; Water indicators; Water resources; Water security","Climate models; Developing countries; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Water resources; 'current; Industrialisation; Iran; Population growth; Urban areas; Urban climates; Urban water securities; Water indicator; Water security; Waters resources; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114739146

Through horizontal transport collaboration (HTC), companies can consolidate their freight into fewer numbers of trucks, leading to cost and environmental savings. Therefore, HTC has been considered a promising strategy to boost the sustainability of freight transport. However, the successful applications of HTC are hampered by multiple barriers. This study contributes to the literature by identifying and prioritizing these barriers through integrating the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP). Firstly, a holistic list of 30 barriers divided into five categories is identified using literature review. Secondly, FDM is used to reach a consensus of experts' opinions regarding the important barriers that warrant undergoing the assessment process by AHP. Thirdly, AHP is used to identify the priority rankings of the five barrier categories and their associated barriers.

The variants are distinguished by the 'primary thinking-secondary thinking' structure between the combined elementary thinking. One of the variants, i.e., Neither-And thinking, is associated with James March's discussion of logic of consequences and logic of appropriateness. An examination of March's writings reveals an additional 'principle-practice' structure underlining March's unique solution to paradox. Incorporating the 'principle-practice' structure into the proposed typology in turn helps us better understand the other variants of 'both/and thinking' such as ambidexterity, contingency, and Zhong-Yong. The typology shows March's Neither-And solution is unique because it embraces a primary neither/nor thinking while all the other variants do not. To demonstrate the value of March's unique solution, I apply Neither-And thinking characterized by the 'principle-practice' relationship to paradoxes outside organization studies, e.g., in Deconstruction, Buddhism, and quantum physics. The wide application of Neither-And thinking implies that James March's unique solution to organizational paradox may have provided a key to understanding paradox in general.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate 751 acquisitions made by 158 UK nonfinancial firms and 202 CEOs in the 10-year period 2007–2016. The authors use the ratio of first-person singular pronouns to total first-person pronouns in CEO speech as the main proxy for CEO narcissism but the results are robust to the use of signature size and picture as alternative measures. Findings: The authors find that increased CEO narcissism is associated with an increase in M&A expenditures, an increase in deal size and a decrease in deal frequency. Thus, the authors find that narcissistic CEOs favor size over frequency (“go big”). Furthermore, the authors find that the stock market reacts less favorably to acquisitions announced by firms run by narcissistic CEOs. Originality/value: The paper contributes to upper echelon research by investigating the association between CEO narcissism and corporate decisions in a UK setting. More specifically, the paper contributes to the existing literature by investigating how CEO narcissism is associated with corporate acquisitions in terms of the size and frequency of deals and how such irrational behavior is penalized by the stock market.

In the ambition to harmonize LCA practices and increase the comparability of studies, the European Commission published the Product Environmental Footprint Guide, with the Circular Footprint Formula to model recycling. The formula considers the market situation of recycled materials, which is consistent with a consequential LCA perspective. Therefore, this paper evaluates the extent to which the Circular Footprint Formula follows a consequential LCA approach. To evaluate this, the considered consequential approach is first systematized in the form of a Causal Loop Diagram that shows the relevant parameters and their relationships. From the diagram, a formula is extracted in the same style of the Circular Footprint Formula, enabling comparison. It is concluded that the Circular Footprint Formula has the potential to, but at the moment does not, provide a full consequential approach. Main discrepancies between the Circular Footprint Formula and consequential LCA are 1) the lack of including the marginal suppliers and marginal users of materials instead of average or specific suppliers and users in the life cycle under study, 2) predetermined limitations of the extent to which substitutions can be modeled, and 3) an incomplete modelling of the effects of recycling when demand is constrained. A few inconsistencies were identified that merit to be corrected in an updated version of the Circular Footprint Formula. It is acknowledged that the Circular Footprint Formula does not claim to be consequential. However, alignment of the method with a clear LCA objective – such as a reduction of environmental impacts – could enable the production of LCA results that better inform decisions of companies, consumers, and policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Consequential LCA; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory; Product environmental footprint; Recycling; Substitution","Environmental impact; Life cycle; Substitution reactions; Assessment approaches; Assessment practices; Causal loop diagrams; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Environmental footprints; European Commission; Life Cycle Inventory; Market situation; Product environmental footprint; Recycled materials; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113953580

R&D subsidized loans (tiexi daikuan) is an effective market-driven solution to promote firms’ R&D outputs, including patent applications and new product sales, in China. However, empirical examination on the effects of subsidized loans is insufficient. Using a panel data of manufacturing firms of Jiangsu Province from 2010 to 2014, the study investigates the effects of R&D subsidized loans on firms’ R&D outputs in comparison to that of the direct R&D grants. The results show that R&D subsidized loan recipients significantly outperform those who only receive direct grants in terms of new product sales. Meanwhile, subsidized loans inhibit the recipients’ exploratory patent applications and discourage R&D activities with higher risks.

The extant literature doesn't mention clearly as to what drivers and sub-drivers are needed for adoption of circular principles in PSS business model. This paper aims to propose a multi-theoretical framework (the resource-based view, resource-dependence theory, and stakeholder theory) and identifies and evaluates drivers and sub-drivers. The paper adopts Grey-Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory multi-criteria decision-making method to evaluate the inter-relationship between the sub-drivers.

This study aims to explore a public–private partnership (PPP) that leverages advanced digital technologies via spinoffs to tackle the key challenge of showrooming that retail shops are facing. Showrooming is the phenomenon in which shoppers go to the physical stores to gather in-depth product information, and later on, decide to buy the product from online retail competitors. Design/methodology/approach: This research draws on a longitudinal qualitative study of a social context in which digital entrepreneurs are embedded. The empirical setting is a retail network in Italy, Germany and Finland with a particular focus on the process in which a PPP delivers innovation via spinoffs in the context of brick and mortar shops (B&M). The research design enables an understanding of the complexity of the phenomenon from a business and a social perspective. Findings: New technology to tackle showrooming enables the creation of substantial hybrid value in retail partnerships. Spinoffs are key actors in leveraging digital technologies to create value faster and more tailored compared with large software companies. Spinoff entrepreneurs leverage on specific technologies (e.g. virtual reality and artificial intelligence) available inside organizations’ network (i.e. PPPs). Spinoffs are found to be a fundamental actor in the process of dealing with showrooming because of their time to market. Large software companies usually are not interested in approaching B&M shops because of the high operational costs of product customization for B&M shops. Practical implications: Managers could use the success factors of the spinoffs in helping their B&M shops to improve both shopper experience and salesperson performance. For managers of B2B retail network, the results are useful towards increasing the involvement of shoppers while they are visiting physical stores, and it also improves salesperson performance. It also leads to the observation that cross-selling is one of the most effective responses to the phenomenon of showrooming. As practical implications for policymakers, the current research supports the view that PPPs should support the creation of spinoffs as a result of longitudinal innovation projects. Social implications: Retail technologies leveraged from a PPP and commercialized by spinoffs are powerful tools to enable a better quality of salespeople’s life in the working place. At the same time, these new technologies help shop owners increase the retention rates, conversion rates and reduce short-term loss, increasing the likelihood of B&M shops to survive in the condition of extreme competition caused by the showrooming phenomenon. Originality/value: This research proposes a model of hybrid value creation from networks in digital retail. The model indicates that PPPs create spinoffs to explore showrooming and deliver substantial hybrid value (i.e. business and social) for physical retail shops, mainly because it influences the companies’ growth, employee performance and customer satisfaction. This model expands the field of B2B marketing by identifying factors that enable spinoff creation from retail networks and proposes success factors and research propositions in retail networks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customer engagement; Digital entrepreneurship; Hybrid value creation; Public–private partnerships; Showrooming; Spin-off creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097012587

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a scoping media analysis of articles published over 1 year in six leading UK newspapers, followed by semi-structured interviews with ten key stakeholders in late 2019. The authors identified categories of arguments, distilled the core conflicts and analysed how arguments reflected different ideas about human nature, the role of the state and solutions to food system challenges. Findings: Arguments were categorised into five major topics: climate change and environment; human health; effects on animals; fairness; and acceptability of government intervention. Pro-meat tax arguments often aligned with modern liberal ideology, and sometimes echoed demand restraint or food system transformation perspectives on sustainable food security. Arguments against meat taxes were more likely to align with the efficiency perspective or classical liberal ideology. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first interpretive analyses of this controversial suggested policy.

To advance theoretical understanding of the topic, this paper develops a conceptual framework for analysing employee involvement in service innovations, reviews existing research on the topic and proposes a research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: Different modes of employee involvement in service innovation are distinguished based on two dimensions: (1) the intensity of employee influence on service innovation and (2) the breadth of the innovation activity in which employees are involved. This conceptual framework is abductively developed through a literature review of empirical service innovation studies to identify and analyse whether and how these modes of employee involvement are manifested in the service innovation literature. Findings: The findings delineate six modes of employee involvement in the reviewed service innovation studies. Employees are primarily seen as having a strong influence on situated innovation activities but a limited influence on systemic innovation activities. The findings show that more research is needed to assess the connections between different modes of employee involvement. Practical implications: The findings can be used by practitioners to assess the possibilities different modes of employee involvement may bring to service innovation activities. Originality/value: The proposed conceptual framework and the analysis of current research and research gaps in service innovation studies provide a clear research agenda for progressing multidimensional understanding of employee involvement in service innovation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee involvement; Employee participation; Innovation processes; Service innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111365934

An efficient intermediate product of such technologies is the biomethanol produced from biomass. Microalgae based technologies offer scalable solutions for the biofixation of CO2, where the produced biomass can be transformed into value-added fuel gas mixtures by applying thermochemical processes. In this study, the environmental and economic performances of biomethanol production are examined using artificial neural networks (ANNs) for the modelling of catalytic and noncatalytic hydrothermal gasification (HTG). Levenberg-Marquardt and Bayesian Regularisation algorithms are applied to describe the thermocatalytic transformation involving various types of feedstocks (biomass and wastes) in the training process. The relationship between the elemental composition of the feedstock, HTG reaction conditions (380 °C–717 °C, 22.5 MPa–34.4 MPa, 1–30 wt% biomass-to-water ratio, 0.3 min–60.0 min residence time, up to 5.5 wt% NaOH catalyst load) and fuel gas yield &amp; composition are determined for Chlorella vulgaris strain. The ideal ANN topology is characterised by high training performance (MSE = 5.680E-01) and accuracies (R2 ≥ 0.965) using 2 hidden layers with 17-17 neurons. The process flowsheeting of biomass-to-methanol valorisation is performed using ASPEN Plus software involving the ANN-based HTG fuel gas profiles. Cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) is carried out to evaluate the climate change potential of biomethanol production alternatives. It is obtained that high greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction (−725 kg CO2,eq (t CH3OH)−1) can be achieved by enriching the HTG syngas composition with H2 using variable renewable electricity sources. The utilisation of hydrothermal gasification for the synthesis of biomethanol is found to be a favourable process alternative due to the (i) variable synthesis gas composition, (ii) heat integration, and (iii) GHG emission mitigation possibilities. © 2021 The Authors","Artificial neural networks; Biomethanol; Cost analysis; Hydrothermal gasification; Life cycle assessment; Power-to-Liquid","Bioethanol; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Emission control; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sodium hydroxide; Sustainable development; Biomethanol; Carbon neutrals; Cost analysis; Fuels gas; Gas compositions; Global warming and climate changes; Hydrothermal gasification; Neural-networks; Power-to-liquid; Sustainability assessment; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112829670

To safely and consistently supply HFSs with power, the use of microgrids (MGs), including various flexible generation units, is considered to be a reliable choice. This paper proposes a competence MG scheduling model. In this model, an optimal coordination of HFSs with demand response (DR), energy storage systems (ESS), and appropriate multi-market mechanisms is addressed. Also, a reformulated version of a risk-constrained stochastic scheduling (RSS) model is used to minimize the MG operation cost. The uncertainties associated with the real-time market price, renewables, electrical loads, and HVs are handled by considering conservativeness parameters. In this model, linearized AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) equations are included in the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem to satisfy the security of MG operation. The proposed model is examined on a 21-bus MG while considering various case studies. The results show that the operation of HFSs provides a profit of 254.5$/day by selling hydrogen for MG operator. In addition, it is found that developing the HFS technology can reduce the total daily operation costs of MG by up to 9.6%. It is also shown that participation of MG in both day-ahead and real-time markets leads to a reduction of 11.7% in the operating costs. Moreover, we show that employing DR programs leads to operation cost reduction and load flattening during high-demand hours. The security constraints keep the voltage between 0.97 p.u. and 1 p.u and the loss of lines within a reasonable range. Finally, a comprehensive comparison between our perceptive RSS with traditional stochastic scheduling and conservative RSS is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Energy storage system; Hydrogen fueling station; Hydrogen vehicles; Microgrid; Risk-constrained","Commerce; Cost reduction; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Microgrids; Scheduling; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Demand response; Energy storage system; Hydrogen fuelling stations; Hydrogen vehicles; Micro grid; Microgrid operations; Operations cost; Risk-constrained; Scheduling models; Stochastic scheduling; Operating costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112580591

This phenomenon known as “de-risking” has been argued to have a negative impact on society, because it increases the possible risk of money laundering. The purpose of this paper is to analyze whether the de-risking strategy of financial institutions results in an expansion of the regulatory framework concerning anti-money laundering focusing on off-boarding of clients and, if so, is there a way to avoid further regulation by changing present behavior. Design/methodology/approach: This paper applies functional methods to law and economics to achieve higher efficiency in combating money laundering. Findings: In this paper, it is found that the continuing of de-risking by financial institutions because of the avoidance strategy of money-laundering risks will inevitably result in further regulatory demands regarding the off-boarding process of clients. The legal basis for the introduction of further regulatory intervention is that some of the de-risking constitutes a direct contradiction to the aim of the present regulatory framework, making the behavior non-compliant to the regulation. Originality/value: There has been very little research concerning de-risking related to money laundering. The present research has focused on the effect on society and not the relationship between the financial institutions and the regulator. This paper raises an important and present problem, as the behavior of the financial institutions constitute a response from the regulator that is contradicting the thoughts behind the behavior of the financial institutions. It is found that the paper is highly relevant if an expansion of regulation is to be hindered. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anti-money laundering; De-risking; Financial crime; Regulatory compliance; Risk regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111154404

The authors argue that an imperative to ‘think with mobility’ and to ‘aspire to be mobile’ shapes identities, futures, and family practices. Drawing on data that examines family travel practices – typically short-term trips – across the working-, middle-, and globally mobile middle-classes, Nurturing Mobilities describes how families travel, why they travel, and the role young family members play in curating family travel. Vitally, it examines the two biggest contemporary issues in global mobility: COVID-19 and climate change. How has COVID-19 changed travel motivations in a world beset by lockdowns and diminished finances? How are concerns around climate change, and engagements with global citizenship education, changing family travel practices? Nurturing Mobilities illuminates new ways in which social class divergence is forged through movements across borders. The authors’ theoretically inter-disciplinary approach delivers a full analysis of the apparently divergent processes that differentiate family travel along social class lines, yet also allow travel to play a core role in social mobility.

Consumer research has provided valuable insight into how individuals are created as responsible subjects but has yet to account for the crucial role of affective dynamics in subject formation. We draw upon affect theorizing and nascent research on ""affective governmentality""in organization and policy studies to theorize the formation of responsible subjects via affective encounters (i.e., consumption encounters through which consumers' capacities to affect and to be affected change), and to explore how affective encounters are mediated downstream. Through a qualitative investigation of the online microloan market, we explain how market intermediaries contribute to the creation of affective-entrepreneurial subjects who willingly supply interest-free loans to the disadvantaged. The intermediaries accomplish this by nurturing and dramatizing a structure of feeling that subtends affective encounters and by deploying apparatuses of affirmation and relatability to target and intervene into affective encounters. In addition to illuminating the affective dynamics involved in consumer responsibilization and subject formation more broadly, our study facilitates critical reflection on the subject-formative power of consumer experiences and experiential marketing and carries important implications for research on charitable giving and critical thinking on microcredit. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Weexamine domestic pharmaceutical firms in China during the 1990s and find that in this context, introducing new products was associated with lower average firm profitability but higher variance. In conformitywith our predictions, these relationships were stronger in areas where the rate of institutional change was higher and for product types that took longer to develop. Thus, we explain why, for particular strategic actions, high riskmay be associated with low returns.

However, little is known about whether experiences of psychological costs among benefit recipients can be relieved by reducing compliance demands in interactions with the state. Across three studies, we provide evidence that reducing demands causes relief. In a survey experiment, we show that psychological costs experienced by Danish unemployment insurance recipients change in response to information about actual reduced compliance demands. In two field studies, we exploit survey data collected around a sudden, exogenous shock (the COVID-19 lockdown of the Danish society in March 2020), which led to immediate reductions in compliance demands in Denmark's active labor market policies. We test whether two groups of benefit recipients experienced reduced psychological costs in response to these sudden reductions in compliance demands imposed by the state. Across all studies, we find that the reduction of compliance demands is associated with an increased sense of autonomy, and in two of the three studies, it is associated with reduced stress. Overall, our findings suggest that psychological costs experienced by benefit recipients are indeed affected by state actions in the form of compliance demands. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

This article demonstrates that quasi-market competition may also affect the distribution of users. First, we develop a simple theoretical framework that distinguishes between user sorting and cream-skimming as mechanisms through which quasi-markets may lead to high-ability users becoming more concentrated among one group of providers and low-ability users among a different group. Second, we empirically examine the impact of a nationwide quasi-market policy that introduced choice and activity-based budgeting into Danish public high schools. We exploit variation in the degree of competition that schools were exposed to, based on the concentration of providers within a geographical area. Using a differences-in-differences design - and register data containing the full population of students over a 9-year period (N = 207,394) - we show that the composition of students became more concentrated in terms of intake grade point average after the reform in high-competition areas relative to low-competition areas. These responses in high-competition regions appear to be driven both by changes in user sorting on the demand side and by cream-skimming behavior among public providers on the supply side. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We exploit concentration-increasing bank mergers and variation in banks' market shares across industries and show that higher credit concentration is associated with higher markups and that high-market-share lenders charge lower loan rates. We argue that this is due to the greater incidence of competing firms sharing common lenders that induce less aggressive product market behavior among their borrowers, thereby internalizing potential adverse effects of higher rates. Consistent with our conjecture, the effect is stronger in industries with competition in strategic substitutes where negative product market externalities are greatest. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

We find that support for economic inclusion is stronger among high-endowment subjects when incomes are known to be redistributed in the future compared to when redistribution is precluded by design. Income redistribution spreads both risks and returns of investments in the population, which in turn induces a higher rate of profitable investments, and this prospect tends to foster support for economic inclusion.

We add to the emerging literature on complaint handling via social media by examining how complaining customers on a company's Facebook page prefer to be treated. We built on the multi-attribute product concept and conducted four sequential studies in the air transport industry. Studies 1–3 were conducted to identify the service failures with a high magnitude of negative utilities as judged by consumers. The studies also served to build a service failure scenario involving relevant service recovery attributes related to the entire complaint process. The results showed that lost baggage had the highest magnitude of negative utility. The attributes that consumers found most appropriate in the case of lost baggage were timeliness and type of initial response, communication modes, compensation type, and types of information throughout the complaint process. Study 4 took this further by putting participants into the scenario to analyze their preferences, segments, and profiles. The findings presented in this study have practical implications for airlines and consumers because the results reveal four distinct consumer segments and indicate the presence of heterogeneous preferences for communication modes and interaction types across segments. © 2021 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","Airline; Customer complaints; Service recovery; Social customer care; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112089188

Despite an international resurgence of interest in institutional innovations for public engagement and a growing literature on democratic innovation, few have fully considered the effects of invited spaces in the form of formal local platforms for collaboration between public and private actors aimed at creating innovative climate policy solutions. This article assesses a model of ‘hybrid democracy’ in the form of a municipal institutional innovation designed as a ‘temporary committee’ consisting of elected councillors and appointed citizens who collaborate on designing a new local strategy for sustainable development. Using a qualitative approach, the article analyses the institutional design and the deliberations among the participants in the process. Two main findings emerge from the study. First, although there is a general appraisal of the more collaborative and participatory modes of engaging in deliberations, the politicians are reluctant to delegate power to non-elected actors. Second, the main effect of this hybrid model is enhanced legitimacy and a mutual understanding between politicians and citizens, rather than innovative policies and bold municipal climate governance. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid democracy; Institutional innovation; Local sustainable development policy; Place-based platforms","democracy; institutional development; institutional framework; policy approach; power relations; qualitative analysis; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108941874

However, how social media brand engagement behavior affects brand performance remains largely unexplored. We capture engagement along two dimensions – volume and variety – and measure brand performance using consumers’ brand attachment, attitudes, and purchase intentions. Based on the power law of practice and combining survey measures with social media data, our analyses reveal a diminishing marginal utility of engagement volume, as the positive impact of engagement behavior on brand outcomes declines at higher engagement levels. However, the variation across performed activities attenuates these diminishing returns on engagement volume. We find consistent evidence for these effects across two studies with 1347 consumers who interacted with different brands. The results question companies’ often unidimensional focus on increasing engagement volume. Instead, our findings suggest that to maximize brand performance on social media platforms, companies should also encourage engagement variety. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Brand engagement; Diminishing marginal utility; Learning curve; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108835482

This study examines the role of employees’ individual-level entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) in terms of proactiveness, risk-taking, and innovativeness, and their relational capital within the organization, on their performance in achieving organizations’ digital strategy goals. We hypothesize that all IEO dimensions are positively associated with employees’ digital strategy performance and that relational capital positively moderates the effect of proactiveness and risk-taking but negatively moderates the effect of innovativeness. The results of an intra-organizational survey of 166 employees at a medium-sized Northern European manufacturing firm provide partial support for our hypotheses. As part of the empirical design, we introduce a four-dimensional scale for organizational and individual digital strategy performance (Digital – Management, Infrastructure, Networking, and development – MIND). With this scale, we contrast the informants’ self-assessment of their individual performance against their assessment of the overall organizational performance.

The article contributes to the literature on household innovation by illustrating how social movement motivations may differ from motivations examined in prior studies focused on self-rewards, as well as examining the implications for free innovations and diffusion patterns in this setting. Social movement innovators are typically motivated by a common cause (such as a quest for a new life order and societal change) and create innovations that address a cause and “system change” rather than individual goals. I identify and define three types of social movement innovation: behavioral, product, and symbolic innovation. The common-cause motivation also creates a new form of diffusion problem that can only be solved through the spread and consumption of new products, behaviors, or techniques by a sufficiently large crowd. Common-cause motivations should thus encourage innovation diffusion, thereby reducing the risk of the diffusion-failure problem usually observed in household innovation research. © 2021 The Author(s)","Behavioral innovation; Common-cause motivations; Diffusion; Product innovation; Social movements; Symbolic innovation","Motivation; Diffusion patterns; Diffusion problems; Failure problems; Innovation diffusion; Innovation research; Social movements; Societal changes; System change; Diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107447625

Drawing on the compensation effect theory, this study investigates how verbal and nonverbal cues used by customer service agents during online service recovery processes affect customers’ perceptions of service chat agents’ warmth and competence and their willingness to cooperate with a service agent to complete the service recovery process. A 2 (message interactivity cues: high vs. low) × 2 (visual cues: high vs. low) between-subjects experimental design is utilized to identify the main and interaction effects of verbal and visual nonverbal cues used in online communications on customers attitudes and behaviors. Results show that use of verbal cues leads to higher perception of a chat agent's competence, but lower perception of a chat agent's warmth while use of visual nonverbal cues results in higher warmth perceptions but lower competence perceptions. The interaction effect of verbal and visual nonverbal cues indicates that visual nonverbal cues have a compensatory effect on message interactivity and vice versa, such that customer-perceived warmth and competence are prone to trade-offs between verbal cues and visual nonverbal cues. Furthermore, perceived warmth and competence mediate the indirect effects of verbal and nonverbal cues on customers’ cooperation intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of use of verbal and nonverbal cues during online communications in service recovery processes are discussed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Compensation effects; Competence; Nonverbal cues; Service recovery cooperation intention; Verbal cues; Warmth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107030277

This practice in energy systems is being challenged by the increasing integration of stochastic renewable energy sources. There is a growing need for exchanging operational flexibility among energy sectors, which requires to improve the sectoral coordination between electricity and natural gas markets. In addition, the dispatch of flexible units in both sectors needs to be made in a more uncertainty-aware manner, requiring to strengthen the temporal coordination between day-ahead and real-time energy markets. We explore the use of existing financial instruments in the form of virtual bidding (VB) as a market-based solution to enhance both sectoral and temporal coordination in energy markets. It is established in the literature that VB by purely financial players is able to enhance the temporal coordination between deterministic day-ahead and real-time markets. By developing various stochastic equilibrium and optimization models, we show that VB by physical players, i.e., gas-fired power plants, at the interface of power and natural gas systems is of great potential to improve not only the temporal coordination between deterministic day-ahead and real-time markets, but also the sectoral coordination between deterministic electricity and natural gas markets. We exploit a fully stochastic co-optimization model as an ideal benchmark, and numerically illustrate the benefits of VB for increasing the overall market efficiency in terms of reduced expected operational cost of the entire energy system. We eventually show that flexible resources in both electricity and natural gas markets are dispatched more efficiently in the day-ahead stage when VB exists. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Electricity market; Generalized Nash equilibrium; Natural gas market; Sectoral and temporal coordination; Stochastic programming; Virtual bidding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106482761

Foreign owned MNEs tended to use performance appraisal more than other organisations in our sample, which may be a reflection of country of origin pressure (with most originating in LMEs). MNEs were also more likely to make use of more comprehensive forms of performance appraisal than their domestic counterparts, including elements that went beyond review and rewards to encompass training and development and career planning.

Due to increased competition, firms employ various types of innovation activities to position themselves against their competitors. Ambidexterity and strategic agility have been found to strengthen this position. Whereas scholars analyzed strategic agility's and ambidexterity's impact on organizational performance, ambidexterity's impact on the competitive advantage of organizations remains largely unexplored. Tensions between exploration and exploitation within an ambidextrous strategy make it difficult to reap benefits in establishing competitive advantage. Contrary, strategic agility centers on organization's capacities to quickly respond to shifting demand, hence, increasing its competitive advantage. Through a mixed-method approach, comprising of a literature review and quantitative analyses of 150 German mid-sized firms in the engineering industry, it is demonstrated how ambidexterity, exploration and exploitation, in conjunction with strategic agility, affect the competitive advantage of firms. In order to sustain, firms should either favor an exploration strategy of innovation processes to come up with radically new knowledge, products and services, or combine an exploitation strategy with strategic agility. A strategy of sole exploitation is not beneficial towards increased competitive advantage, while an ambidextrous strategy seems to even negatively influence the competitive advantage of a firm. © 2020","Ambidexterity; Competitive advantage; Firm innovation; Strategic agility; Strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096398538

Nine hospital departments were chosen to change their management control system from a strict top-down productivity focus to a locally developed performance measurement system based on a patient focus. Thus, the management control system was changed with the aim of enhancing the social impact of the provided hospital services by integrating a patient focus. The paper portrays a three-year evolution through management narratives. Findings evidence initial embracement of the project followed by gradual operational management discouragement due to external productivity pressures and internal data issues. Despite these challenges, the regional management highlighted the project as a success and expanded it to the remaining departments. Thus, we find that the project became decoupled rather than institutionalized due to a sustained productivity logic. Through the lens of institutional theory, we argue that a decoupling of the patient focused project happens because of a surprisingly strong institutionalized productivity logic. We suggest that in this context of strong coupling of previous systems, organizations may paradoxically engage in decoupling practices that are intended to support their professional core practices but instead protect the administrative logic of efficiency and productivity. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Critical study; Hospital; Institutional Theory; Performance measures; Quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090306205

It develops the more general concept of gossip by combining it with concepts of organizational secrecy in order to propose confidential gossip as a distinctive communicative practice. As a communicative practice, it is to be understood as playing a particular role within the communicative constitution of organizations. That particularity arises from the special nature of any communication regarded as secret, which includes the fact that such communication is liable to be regarded as containing the ‘real truth’ or ‘insider knowledge’. Thus it may be regarded as more than ‘just gossip’ and also as more significant than formal communication. This role is explored, as well as the methodological and ethical challenges of studying confidential gossip empirically. © The Author(s) 2020.","communicative constitution of organizations (CCO); confidential gossip; ethics; gossip; secrecy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089989803

Yet, while aligning with the platform ecosystem rules, each member must decide whether to specialize in a given platform ecosystem or across multiple platform ecosystems to capture these benefits. We examine two common patterns through which platform ecosystem members (i.e., complementors) specialize within and across platform ecosystems, and the relative impact on their market performance. We look at the high relative standing of the complementary product as a reflection of complementors' specialization in the given product category or platform ecosystem. We then theorize that having products with high relative standing in a single product category and a single platform ecosystem, together, diminishes complementors’ market performance over time. Similarly, high relative standing in multiple platform ecosystems and multiple product categories, at the same time, adversely impacts the market performance. We find supportive evidence for our hypotheses, in a panel dataset of mobile app developers. This paper contributes to the burgeoning stream of research that investigates the trade-offs faced by complementors, suggesting that complementor strategies are more complex than simply trying to maximize market reach. © 2020","Complementors; Digital platform; Mobile app developer; Platform ecosystem; Specialization","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Complementary products; Digital platforms; Market opportunities; Market performance; Multiple platforms; Multiple products; Platform ecosystems; Product categories; Ecosystems; complementarity; performance assessment; software; specialization; technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083592905

This article aims to determine how discursive strategies employed by organizations to frame diversity are constructed in digital contexts. Drawing on the literature related to diversity in organizations and its framing in external digital contexts, this study adopts a critical perspective on the discourse analysis of corporate multimodal communication. This methodological approach allows us, first, to map the discursive strategies used to frame diversity in digital contexts through several semiotic modes; and second, to unravel in detail how this discursive construction is realized in terms of social actors, social actions, space, and time. This approach is empirically applied to the case of a leading global organization, Google. The study takes current research on diversity-related framing in corporate digital communication forward and shifts the focus to multimodal discursive strategies. Researchers can use this methodological approach to capture and analyze in detail the ongoing processes of discursive representations, and to produce longitudinal studies. Practitioners can become more aware of the multimodal character of contemporary communication and build on this study to ensure that their diversity-related framing is characterized by consistency across different digital platforms. © The Author(s) 2018.","corporate multimodal communication; critical discourse analysis; discursive digital strategies; diversity commitment and management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045302169

However, immediately after program termination, solid analysis of the growth of the treated firms in comparison with similar firms cannot be produced, so decision makers rely on less valid data. Moreover, the decision process is challenging because many players, alternative programs, decision levels and financial sources tend to be part of the process. In such a complex and volatile policy environment, successful programs may well be discontinued despite a clear continuation need. The purpose of the paper is to explore this weakness. Design/methodology/approach: The paper identifies four fundamental principles that are conducive for a rational continuation choice: “additionality,” “substitution,” “need” and “success”. It argues that if these principles are fulfilled, the rational choice would be to continue the program. To demonstrate that this rational outcome does not always happen in practice, an extreme case fulfilling the four principles well was selected. Findings: The program aimed to enhance growth in small firms through manager training. It encompassed about 700 growth-oriented small firms in three years and was comprehensively evaluated after program termination. This evaluation demonstrated a high success rate of the program in all respects, including in terms of achieved growth compared to a control group of similar firms. Originality/value: This discontinuation case suggests that non-rational reasoning plays a significant role in contemporary complex and volatile policy environments, which again points to a need for reform in this policy area. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discontinuation; Growth; Policy programs; Small business",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108300380

A hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/refueling station (EHGRS) powered by renewable energy in an off-grid region is proposed. It supplies electricity for electric vehicles (EVs), and hydrogen for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs) and produces natural gas for natural gas vehicles (NGVs) simultaneously. A hybrid stochastic/information gap decision theory (IGDT) optimization method is employed for the scheduling problem of the hybrid EHGRS in an uncertain environment. The uncertainties of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power is modelled via scenarios, while the uncertainties of the demands of EVs, HFCVs and NGVs, depending on human behavior, are formulated with a bi-level IGDT method without knowing the accurate distribution information. The work aims to find the maximum expected profits of the hybrid EHGRS. Two different scheduling strategies, i.e. risk-averse and risk-seeker, with two contradictory attitudes under the uncertain demands are proposed. Results indicate that 1) The proposed hybrid EHGRS can simultaneously provide different fuels to EVs, HFCVs and NGVs. 2) Under the same condition, the profit for the risk-averse scheduling is decreased and the risk-seeker scheduling is increased, compared to the results obtained by the pure stochastic optimization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/ refueling station; Information gap decision theory; Renewable energy; Scheduling; Stochastic optimization","Behavioral research; Decision theory; Electric power transmission networks; Fuel cells; Optimization; Profitability; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Hybrid electricity/hydrogen/gas/ refueling station; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen gas; Information gap decision theory; Information-gap; Off-grids; Renewable energies; Risk averse; Stochastic optimizations; Uncertainty; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109437255

Historically, efforts to reduce CO2 emissions focused on Operational Energy (OE) of the finished buildings. However, in recent years the Embodied Energy (EE) of the building’s construction process has gained attention because of its essential role in construction renovations projects. In this context, construction efficiency, and more precisely, workers’ efficiency, is a vital catalyst to achieve the European Union (EU) targets. To identify the impact of Construction Labour Productivity (CLP) on the renovation wave an exploratory case study was adopted as research strategy. Data from four domestic housing renovation projects were gathered. Three specific research goals are outlined. The first is to demonstrate the effect of the adoption of Lean tools and methods to increase CLP. The second is to quantify the correlation between improved productivity and the EE emissions saved during the construction phase. The third goal is to estimate the effect the higher productivity has on OE emissions. The results show that the adoption of several Lean tools and methods has a potential to improve CLP to 45%. This rate of improvement for the 35 million housing units to be renovated could save 6.9 million tonnes CO2 e from EE and 386 million tonnes CO2 e from OE. This novelty link between process improvements and reduced energy consumption and emissions can support politicians and infrastructural developers in decision-making for a more sustainable construction industry. © 2021 by the author(s).","Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions; Construction Labour Productivity (CLP); Embodied Energy (EE); Lean Construction; Renovation Wave",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116572434

The majority of research on project complexity is descriptive and deploys a retrospective perspective on projects, where projects are seen as final objects. The use of an ex-ante approach, used for assessment in the initial phases of projects, is less commonly seen in research but has got some attention. However, for the involved managers, the project complexity is a lived experience as the projects evolve in dynamic interactions with the stakeholders. Not much research has focused on this perspective. This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining the unpredictability of events course by project complexity. The theorizing is based on critical realism and focuses on the identification of generative mechanisms as the methodology. The paper then discusses the potential value of the proposed theory - both to the research of project complexity and for practitioners of project management. © 2021 Editora Mundos Sociais.

We propose a way of approaching and gathering such examples, and introduce a tool for constructing and analyzing the design spaces these collections form. Each example is deconstructed in terms of aspects of concern and options for how these aspects can be implemented. The example is then represented within a design space schema comprising aspect-option sets. This makes it possible to conceptualize a design space of aspect-option sets reflecting the focal collection, and to position individual examples within that design space. We demonstrate our approach through an analysis of 54 media architecture installations listed on the Media Architecture Biennale award nomination lists from 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. We discuss how this approach compares to similar approaches, and detail the knowledge building process that it enables, which includes two main elements: 1) developing a language to describe the examples in terms of the aspect-option sets; and 2) exploring the design space through filtering the design space. © 2021 The Authors","Design collection; Design creativity; Design repertoire; Design space; Media architecture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118576688

Hence, cultural effects in teams are a relevant matter of subject clarifying the ambiguous findings from previous research. With this background, we investigate how the macro-constructs of conflict, communication effectiveness, social integration, creativity and satisfaction interact with cultural diversity on team performance in an environment characterised by a largely homogeneous and ethnic workforce. We test our hypotheses on a sample of firms in Thailand. Our results indicate that creativity and satisfaction have a significant positive impact on team performance whereas cultural diversity has a significant positive impact on influencing conflict in a team-based environment. However, cultural diversity has no significant impact on communication effectiveness and social integration, and it has no significant impact on team performance. The key theoretical contributions from our study are that cultural diversity can contribute to conflict even in a team composition that is seemingly cohesive and homogeneous in nature.

Firms' internationalization process is a central and enduring theme in international business. However, most of the theoretical models are built on the analysis of advanced economy multinationals. Emerging market multinationals differ crucially in the role that the home country plays in their behavior, resulting in different patterns of internationalization. We propose that the discussion of the applicability of extant theory can be advanced by differentiating internationalization theories according to three different ontological perspectives: resource oriented, transaction oriented, and process oriented. We further suggest that the study of emerging market multinationals' internationalization processes reveals three contextual accelerators: government, catch-up, and global value chains. These accelerators help adapt internationalization process models to new contextual realities. © 2021 The Author(s)","Emerging markets; EMNCs; Internationalization process; Multinational companies; Outward foreign direct investment; Resources and capabilities; Transactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115296735

Extant research focuses on the deliberative potential of internal governance structures yet neglects the influence of broader sociopolitical contexts on the members that participate in them. Anti-corruption is one CSR issue that MSIs increasingly address which is particularly context dependent. Therefore, this study examines how different sociopolitical contexts influence members’ justifications and approaches to anti-corruption during MSI deliberations and ultimately, how this impacts the MSI’s approach to anti-corruption. Through a single case study of an MSI, the ASEAN CSR Network which is situated in Southeast Asia with members representing business and CSR organizations in six different countries, the findings show that the different National Business Systems clearly influence the member justifications and approaches to anti-corruption. Further, the MSI reinforces and promotes the adoption of the different national business system-related justifications and approaches ultimately, leading to an MSI approach to anti-corruption which is a composite of the different national business system-related approaches. This paper makes three contributions to the literature on MSI deliberations. First, it proposes a novel framework that links the influence of national business systems to member justifications and approaches to anti-corruption during MSI deliberations by leveraging the orders of worth framework. Second, it shows that the concept of compromise may be more relevant to understanding and evaluating MSI deliberations than the notion of consensus. Third, it contributes through the empirical study of an MSI developed in Southeast Asia addressing anti-corruption. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115110830

This article compares two national debates in Germany and British India from the 1880s to the 1930s. Despite significant differences in the cultural and economic contexts of the two countries and in the emergence of futures trading, there are interesting similarities. In both countries, individual futures exchanges were organized and controlled by small privileged groups of traders. These minorities were glued together by social ties, de facto controlling (or profiting from) access to futures markets and facing criticism because of their privileged position. While contemporaries and historians often focus on futures trading as trading without intent to deliver, the historical analysis in this article shows that an equally important issue was the conflict over distribution and power between more and less privileged interest groups and their respective market access. © 2021 The Author(s).

Superfluous work is a kind of hidden waste and comprises the gap between necessary work and the work that is actually carried out, either on handling daily tasks at the shop floor, accomplishing decision-making processes, or implementing workarounds. By using an abductive approach, the research systematically combines a theoretical conceptualization of shopfloor decision-making processes in smart-manufacturing with an empirical enquiry into a highly digitalized manufacturing company. The paper reveals superfluous work if the decision-making process involves collaboration across disciplines and/or organizational boundaries. Superfluous work occurs because of a lack of data and information to guide re°ective thinking and knowledge sharing. In relation to highly complex decision-making, the ongoing implementation of workarounds also causes superfluous work. Prerequisites for reducing superfluous work are enhancing the accessibility of applicable data to guide re°ective thinking and knowledge sharing at the shopfloor level. © World Scientific Publishing Co.","Decision-making; Knowledge sharing; Shopfloor management; Smart-manufacturing; Superfluous work","Concrete pavements; Floors; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Data and information; Decision making process; Knowledge-sharing; Manufacturing companies; Organizational boundaries; Shop floor management; Shopfloor levels; Smart manufacturing; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112845681

The resulting intercultural contact have been examined using the theory of globalization-based acculturation. However, little is known about possible differences and similarities in processes underlying the effects of direct (e.g., through contact with immigrants) and indirect (e.g., engagement with cultural elements through media) forms of new cultural exposure. Drawing on the contact hypothesis, social identity theory, and symbolic threat theory, we examined whether perceived intercultural threat and local and global identities would explain whether both forms of contact result in multicultural acquisition or in ethnic protection. In Study 1 (N = 402), indirect, but not direct, intercultural contact was positively associated with multicultural acquisition; and both types of intercultural contact were negatively linked with ethnic protection. Global identity significantly mediated the association of both direct and indirect intercultural contact with both multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection, whereas perceived cultural threat only significantly mediated the associations of direct intercultural contact with multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection. In Study 2 (N = 424), higher levels of ethnic protection, and lower levels of multicultural acquisition, emerged in the experimental group primed with indirect, versus direct, intercultural contact. Furthermore, intercultural threat was negatively, and global identity positively, associated with multicultural acquisition, while intercultural threat was positively, and global identity negatively, associated with ethnic protection. Results are discussed in relation to similarities and differences across direct and indirect intercultural contact, providing a nuanced understanding of contemporary intercultural contact and globalization-based acculturation among majority populations. © 2021 The Author(s)","Acculturation; Contact hypothesis; Cultural threat; Globalization; Immigration attitudes; Intercultural relations; Social identity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111260876

To better understand how MNEs respond to positive institutional changes in challenging markets, we examine the relative effects of peace agreements and MNE capabilities on foreign direct investment. We expect that MNEs can engage in institutional arbitrage by leveraging political capabilities in their home market as well as their environmental, social, and governance capabilities to enter conflict-affected countries. Thus, rather than focusing solely on managing downside risk, we also analyze the relative value of MNE capabilities as countries strive to become more peaceful.

For organisations, the consequences of these changes are to replace static capabilities with dynamic capabilities, such as futures literacy. This paper explores the concept of futures literacy and identifies some of the barriers to developing futures literacy in organisations. As research related to futures literacy is still in its infant stage, no existing research has identified barriers to developing futures literacy in organisations. This article aims to make that contribution to advance this field of study and provide understanding of where best to invest to overcome such barriers. Due to the nature of futures literacy and its relation to foresight, we put forward the hypothesis that for all its merits, futures literacy may be faced with several barriers when developed in organisations, such as organisational culture, lack of experience, mental models, measurability and clarity on investment. We explore this hypothesis through a literature review on barriers to develop foresight in organisations, combined with an additional literature review on barriers to enhance learning environments in organisations, followed by a single retrospective case study to test if the identified barriers are present. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Capabilities; Foresight; Futures studies; Innovation; Learning","future prospect; innovation; learning; literacy; organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110503917

However, as a common problem of non-financial disclosure regulation, companies can decide the extent and content of their reporting, which could potentially result in merely symbolic disclosures with little substance. We examine the disclosure of substantive actions in modern slavery statements, defined as those disclosures of corporate actions that can positively affect working conditions in supply chains. We examine the corporate disclosure of these actions over time in order to evaluate whether legally mandated disclosure requirements could lead to progress in combatting modern slavery. For this purpose, we collected modern slavery statements from companies that had issued such statements for at least two different years after the introduction of the regulatory requirement in the United Kingdom and performed a content analysis with a coding instrument that captures substantive actions against modern slavery. Our analysis uncovers extremely heterogeneous reporting practices, especially regarding the disclosure of the effectiveness of actions against modern slavery. Based on our analysis, we identify best practices of substantive disclosures to offer a benchmark for corporate self-reports of modern slavery and inform policymaking on modern slavery reporting. © 2021 The Authors","Content analysis; CSR Disclosures; Legitimacy theory; Modern slavery statements; Social sustainability; Substantive disclosures","Laws and legislation; Condition; Content analysis; Corporates; CSR disclosure; Financial disclosure; Labor standards; Legitimacy theories; Modern slavery statement; Social sustainability; Substantive disclosure; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110306229

However, practicing and adopting product longevity remain challenging. Currently, the literature primarily focuses on various proposals and strategies that could lead to an increase in the longevity of products. However, adopting product longevity in practice demands an overview of barriers that must be accounted for before appropriate strategies and proposals can be selected and implemented. Until now, such an overview of the barriers for longevity is largely undefined. This paper contributes by identifying 14 distinct barriers that are likely to obstruct companies from introducing long-lasting products, to challenge their product development or to make it difficult for consumers to keep or maintain their products for a long time. In this paper, a comprehensive review provides a list of barriers that have been identified through the existing literature across three perspectives: 1) companies and manufacturers, 2) designers, engineers and developers and 3) customers/consumers and users. A systematic search revealed 4204 academic papers that relate to the topic. After reviewing the titles, abstracts and keywords of these papers, a total of 143 papers combined with additional 62 articles identified through snowballing and post-identification were identified as eligible to constitute the foundation of this review. From these, a list of 14 product longevity barriers was created. The result is a unique identification and overview of barriers to product longevity as well as a categorisation of these barriers with respect to stakeholders. © 2021","Long-lasting products; Planned obsolesce; Product durability; Product lifetime; Product lifetime extension; Prolonged product life","Obsolescence; Planning; Business products; Circular economy; Long lasting; Long-lasting product; Planned obsolesce; Product durability; Product lifetime; Product lifetime extension; Prolonged product life; Users perspective; Product development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109071200

Novel preparation methods for anodes as catalysts should be considered in order to achieve larger active sites and diverse oxidants production, which can directly enhance the degradation performance. Therefore, in this work, a new cheap and green electrode material modification or synthesis method was studied. A graphene-like carbon mesoporous layer and SnO2 layer over TiO2 was produced and it resulted in higher porosity and stability of the electrode. This led to dominating advantage on photo/electrocatalytic activity and degradation performances. Synthesized electrodes attribute better charge separation and it was analyzed by electrochemical characterization. Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide (O2−) radicals were dominant oxidants in the degradation process based on the catalytic and degradation mechanism. However, the synergistic effect of photo and electro-catalytic degradation performances shrank under unoptimized PEC operational parameters. Therefore, the effect of various PEC parameters for the degradation of emerging pollutants was optimized. It was found that 90% degradation of emergent pollutants was achieved at optimized PEC operational parameters within 60 min of reaction time. Intermediates via PEC degradation of emerging pollutants were identified and a possible removal pathway was thus proposed. The three-dimensional SnO2-G-TiO2 electrodes hold great potential for PEC treatment of wastewater treatment. © 2021","% degradation; Pharmaceutical wastewater; Photo-electrocatalysis; SnO2-G-TiO2 electrodes; TOC","Anodes; Carbon; Catalyst activity; Degradation; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical electrodes; Oxidants; Pollution; Reaction intermediates; Wastewater treatment; % degradation; Graphene likes; Performance; Pharmaceutical wastewater; Photo-electrocatalysis; Photoelectrocatalysis; SnO$-2$; SnO2-G-TiO2 electrode; TiO$-2$; TOC; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109007901

Building on the literatures on employee-driven innovation and motivation, the main goal of this study is to investigate the behaviours performed by employees to support and refine others' ideas and their underlying motivations to do so, thus going beyond the role of innovators.

To explain how such rhetorical framing occurs, this paper explores kairos as a conceptualization of the duality of encountering and enabling “the decisive moment.” Following a process of advocating a new IT strategy in a financial firm, we find that kairos appears when the rhetorical framing of time is consistent with dominant interpretations of the interrelations between the past, present and future of the organization.

Denmark has set ambitious targets to lower its territorial carbon emissions in the next decades. In 2019, the Danish Agriculture and Food Council announced a strategy to make Denmark's food production systems climate-neutral by 2050. Therefore, detailed information concerning Denmark's food consumption's environmental impacts is required to implement effective climate mitigation and resource conservation policies that lead to positive local to global results. Using an environmentally extended multi-regional input-output (EE MRIO) analysis and the EXIOBASE v3.4 database, we evaluate Denmark's global food-related consumption-based (CB) greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and resource (land and water use) accounts from 1995 to 2014. Although Denmark's CB food-related blue water use remained relatively stable during the studied period, its food-related CB GHG emissions (excluding land-use change emissions) decreased continuously by 30%. Also, Denmark's cropland and grassland footprints for food declined by 16% (3555 km2) and 27% (621 km2), respectively. Almost two-fifths of Denmark's food consumption was produced abroad in 2014, corresponding to 51% of Denmark's food-related CB GHG emissions and land use apiece and 84% of its food-related blue water use. Whereas animal-based foods accounted for the largest share of Denmark's food-related CB GHG emissions, plant-based diets were responsible for the bulk of Denmark's CB land and blue water use. Dietary changes towards plant-based foods are essential to mitigating Denmark's food-related climate impacts. We recommend that Denmark transfers its sustainable food production technologies to its pollution-and-resource intensive food-exporting trade partners to enhance global climate change mitigation and resource use efficiency. © 2021","EXIOBASE; Food products; GHG and Resource footprints; Life-cycle assessment; Multi-regional input-output analysis","Biodiversity; Commerce; Environmental impact; Food supply; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Natural resources; Blue water; Denmark; EXIOBASE; Food consumption; Food production; Greenhouse gas emission and resource footprint; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Multi-regional input-output analyse; Water use; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107946590

This study uses two datasets: an exploratory dataset on 253 FLEs and a multilevel and multisource dataset on 444 FLEs and 55 service managers. Findings reveal that managers who are unsuccessful in their careers still stimulate frontline learning processes, but their subordinates generally use only their service-related personal learning to generate ideas for service improvement.

Thus, new challenges have arisen in terms of people's quality of life, natural resources renewal, and urban environment sustainability. The smart city concept was developed to deal with these challenges by incorporating new technologies in order to find solutions that preserve cities’ environment while promoting their residents’ wellbeing. However, for cities to be truly “smart”, they should be evaluated, and, to that end, determinants that facilitate their creation need to be identified. This study thus sought to combine cognitive mapping and the system dynamics approach to find which factors foster smart city success, as well as the cause-and-effect relationships among these determinants. In two groupwork sessions, a panel of experts identified a wide range of smart city determinants and analyzed the dynamics of their relationships. The results were validated by the panel members and senior representatives of Cascais and Évora City Councils, Portugal, who confirmed that the analysis system developed provides a deeper understanding of this research context.

However, recreational activities may have negative implications for birdlife, which calls for balancing of both types of use by integrated coastal and marine planning and management. Successful integrated management and planning require spatiotemporal knowledge about the species needing protection and the outdoor recreation activities. This paper examines water-oriented outdoor recreation in Denmark in terms of activities, seasonality and geographical distribution, and presents a national screening of spatiotemporal overlap between coastal and marine recreational activities and waterbirds based on 10,291 responses and 6,499 geographical positions. In total 77.6% of the Danish population participated in water-oriented outdoor recreation activities at least once within a year. The most frequent activities were to move along or stay on the coast/shore (63.9%), to bathe and swim (34.4%) and to observe nature and wildlife (20.3%). Overlap between recreation and waterbirds, representing potential conflicts, ranged from 0.8% in winter on water to 27.7% in summer on the coast. The results revealed significant negative effects between recreational activities and abundance of waterbirds during spring and summer on the water. The results also indicate that most recreational activities use areas with no or low densities of waterbirds. Successful coastal and marine planning requires application of management tools that include educational and interpretative initiatives to enhance coexistence. However, for detailed management, more studies are urgently needed of spatiotemporal patterns, adaptations, conflicts and coexistence between recreational activity and waterbirds. Management implications: The results support integrated planning and management of water-based recreation in conjunction with waterbirds by: - Providing spatially explicit year-round data on recreational and waterbird use of coastal and marine areas. - Obtaining the first ever national overview of potential areas of conflict and of possibilities for coexistence between coastal and marine recreation and waterbirds. - Identifying specific local areas in need of management action and more detailed studies of effects and impacts of coastal and marine recreation on waterbirds. © 2021 The Authors","Breeding birds; Ecosystem services; Marine planning; Moulting birds; Outdoor recreation; PPGIS",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107680864

Vaccine supply chains are no exception. Therefore, it is elemental that challenges to the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain (VSC) are identified and prioritized to pave the way out of this pandemic. This study combines the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method with intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) to explore the key challenges of the COVID-19 VSC. The IFS theory tackles the uncertainty of key challenges while DEMATEL addresses the interlaced causal relationships among crucial challenges to the COVID-19 VSC. This work identifies 15 challenges and reveals that ‘Limited number of vaccine manufacturing companies’, ‘Inappropriate coordination with local organizations’, ‘Lack of vaccine monitoring bodies’, ‘Difficulties in monitoring and controlling vaccine temperature’, and ‘Vaccination cost and lack of financial support for vaccine purchase’ are the most critical challenges. The causal interactions along with mutual relationships among these challenges are also scrutinized, and implications for sustainable development goals (SDGs) are drawn. The results offer practical guidelines for stakeholders and government policy makers around the world to develop an improved VSC for the COVID-19 virus. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","COVID-19 pandemic; DEMATEL; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS); Vaccine supply chain (VSC)","Decision theory; Fuzzy sets; Planning; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Vaccines; Viruses; COVID-19 pandemic; Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Decisions makings; Fuzzy-set theory; Intuitionistic fuzzy set; Intuitionistic fuzzy sets; Laboratory methods; Uncertainty; Vaccine supplies; Vaccine supply chain; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107596870

Thus, this paper aims to help SMEs from emerging markets in choosing the right business partners with whom to cooperate to develop relevant innovations in crisis periods in general, and during the COVID-19 pandemic in particular. To obtain relevant insights, qualitative data from SMEs in Bosnia and Herzegovina were collected in March-April 2020. The findings show that SMEs have embraced new collaborations with business customers and competitors, and developed a collaborative mindset opposed to the traditionally competitive way of doing business in emerging markets.

The theory of enabling formalization is applied to gauge and understand the extent to which organizational members perceive performance measures, such as key performance indicators (KPIs), as enabling (i.e. as a vehicle creating continuous improvement). We empirically confirm a positive relation between changing the context of performance measures and the perceived level of enabling use of KPIs by applying a difference-in-differences test. We also show that the increase in perceptions of the enabling use of KPIs is associated with improved perceived performance (e.g. time consumption, quality). We measure the perceived enabling use using data gathered from questionnaires distributed over several rounds in both the department implementing lean principles and a non-affected control department.

We theorize and show empirically – via a mixed-method approach applied to a representative and remarkably informative case – that the payoff structure for crowdfunders, akin to a public good contribution problem, leads to the tangible value of main project outputs exerting little influence on contributions to crowdfunding. This then raises the question of which funder motivations fund seekers may have to address to crowdfund their projects. We demonstrate the especially large role of non-pecuniary motivations and pinpoint three particular motivations that profit-seeking entrepreneurs may stimulate to be financed through crowdfunding.

These risky situations make the behavior of frontline professionals particularly important. But what shapes the risk perception and subsequent behavior of frontline professionals in risky situations? This article explores the idea that organizational culture provides part of the answer. To examine this, a comprehensive qualitative study with participant observations and interviews at five public hospital wards was conducted. The findings demonstrate the importance of organizational culture on risk perception and behavior in risky situations. Basic cultural assumptions related to professional discussion, administering medicine, grading of adverse events, and prioritizing follow-up activities matter to behavior in risky situations. In organizational cultures with high levels of trust and dialogue about decision-making, the health professionals rely on each other and ask for second opinions, when making decisions in risky situations. Conversely, in organizational cultures with little trust and professional discussion, the health professionals are less likely to ask for second opinions and follow up on risky situations, which increases the possibility of unintended, negative consequences. In this way, organizational culture can be a driver of risk-reducing and risk-seeking behavior among frontline professionals. © The Author(s) 2021.","behavior; frontline professionals; interviews; organizational culture; participant observations; risk perception; risky situations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105265513

To remedy this situation, the article makes a comparative analysis of what duties parent companies have vis-à-vis their subsidiaries. It is shown that national law differs substantially but there is a duty to collect information about the subsidiaries, and a duty to oversee subsidiaries seems to be emerging. On the other hand, there is no duty to actively manage subsidiaries in most of the jurisdictions examined. Subsequently, a comparative analysis is made of the remedies available in national law to protect the interests of stakeholders in the parent companies. Whereas there are several rules on group law which prevent subsidiaries from being used to circumvent regulation aiming to protect stakeholders in the parent company and several rules ensuring transparency about the performance of the group, it is argued that there is a lack of rules ensuring transparency about intra-group transactions and rules ensuring the influence of shareholders in the parent company. Finally, it is argued that the ongoing harmonising of group law in the EU should also include aspects that clarify the position of parent companies in a group. © 2021, T.M.C.

In this study, two samples are used with entrepreneurial intentions being analyzed among university business students and entrepreneurial status being analyzed by surveying entrepreneurs versus employees. We analyze findings in three different institutional environments (Germany, Russia, and the USA) to also identify potential effects stemming from country context. Therefore, this study offers findings for a (i) comprehensive set of personal factors on (ii) different outcomes in the entrepreneurial process in (iii) different countries. The results suggest that the role of broad personality traits for entrepreneurial outcomes is highly contextual. Also, the role of narrow traits shows some contextuality for which further theorizing is promoted—for instance, while risk-taking propensity seems to be a trait of relevance in all contexts, innovativeness and proactiveness are of different relevance in the different institutional environments. Moreover, the narrow traits that impact entrepreneurial intention and status differ considerably—for instance, innovation is of special relevance for entrepreneurial status, but less important for entrepreneurial intentions. Hence, this study contributes to our understanding not only of individual personal factors contributing to entrepreneurial intention and status but also to understanding which factors overlap for individuals who intend to start a new business and those that do so. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Broad personality traits; Comparative study; Emotional intelligence; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial status; Narrow personality traits; Person-entrepreneurship fit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103222895

Different forms of labor support the transnational fertility market, bringing geopolitical, and social inequities to the fore. While some people need wombs, eggs, or sperm to create their families—and have the means to pay for third-party reproductive services—others emerge as suppliers of reproductive labor, and still others as coordinators or service agents in the international fertility industry. Building upon contemporary feminist social science and postcolonial research on reproductive travel and labor, this article explores three intersecting components: the forces that influence reproductive travel and cross-border egg donation; how emotion and meaning are framed in clinical settings to recruit a young, healthy, able-bodied workforce; and the embodied experiences of women who travel across borders to provide eggs for pay. Drawing upon donor and professional interviews, and multisited online and ethnographic fieldwork in fertility clinics, we explore the linkages between emotional choreography and the creation of a bioavailable workforce for the global fertility trade. Here, we examine how local and cross-border egg provision illuminate global reproductive hierarchies—what we call “reproductive colonialism”—in transnational reproduction. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","bioavailability; colonialism; commodification of the body; egg donation; reproductive travel; reproductive work","bioavailability; birth rate; feminism; reproductive health; service sector; trade flow; womens status",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102298807

It has attracted considerable academic attention. Most studies, however, have neglected internal resources (e.g., workers or material handling equipment) and hence failed to address two major concerns of cross-docking practitioners: (i) determining the number of resources needed, and (ii) scheduling the internal resources in an efficient way. This study sets out to examine the value of utilizing the internal resource requirements as the main performance metrics in truck scheduling. The problem considered in this paper is how to schedule a set of inbound trucks with time windows at a multidoor cross-docking platform, where the departure times of outbound trucks follow a given schedule. The goal is to identify a feasible truck schedule that can be executed with a minimum number of internal resources. For this setting, a mixed-integer programming model is proposed. Furthermore, a column generation-based solution procedure is developed. We show that by using the internal resource requirements as the main performance measure, the operational efficiency of the cross-docking platform can be significantly increased. It also helps to avoid large peak workloads and leads to level truck schedules with superior resource utilization levels. Computational experiments show that the proposed heuristic algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions for very large problem instances within a short computation time. Due to its tight lower bound, the solution procedure can even prove optimality for most problem instances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Column generation; Cross-docking; Internal resource requirement; Performance measure; Truck scheduling","article; computer heuristics; human; performance indicator; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102015103

Consequent revisions of the model shifted its focus from ‘internationalization’ to ‘evolution’ in firms more generally, thereby undermining its relevance and paradigmatic status. This calls for a new conceptual basis and a ‘paradigm shift’ in research on the internationalization process of the firm. To promote this endeavor, this Counterpoint advocates the explicit adoption of historical perspectives, such as that of the original Uppsala studies, and methodologies, especially ‘archeological’ discourse analysis, as originally developed by Michel Foucault. Its aim is to understand the process of knowledge creation in specific societal contexts.

Different tasks are assigned weights and the total workload is the weighted sum of the tasks performed. Traditional approaches for establishing the weights, including the using of Delphi methods or detailed time-studies, are however expensive, and the resulting weights are often challenged by the evaluated entities. In this paper, we discuss how to mitigate these problems. We study the problem within the context of the judiciary system. To ensure an efficient judiciary, it is usually considered necessary to have a reliable case weighting system (CWS). Different types of court cases, e.g. criminal versus civil cases, have different resource needs, and to get a relevant aggregate measure of the tasks at hand, it is therefore necessary to weight the different court cases, i.e. to construct a case mix corrected workload measure. We suggest a “benefit-of-the-doubt” (BoD) approach inspired by recent developments in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). We allow for uncertain weights based on only partial information about the “true” weights, and we evaluate individual courts with the weights that put them in their most favorable light. In addition to making the weight setting easier and less disputable in applications, our approach dispenses with several limitations of a traditional weighted caseload approach, including the implicit assumptions of constant returns to scale and a constant rate of substitution between caseloads. Moreover, most of the applications of detailed case weights are still available using our BoD approach. We can continue to evaluate the efficiency of individual courts and device sound and fair resource allocation procedures that are robust to the remaining uncertainty about weights. We illustrate our approach by several real-world applications and discuss relevant extensions and applications in other areas, including regulation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation; Case studies; Courts; DEA; Workload","article; case mix; court; human; offender; resource allocation; sound; uncertainty; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096880281

However, it offers managers limited control over the type of website where the ad appears, resulting in brand safety issues. Aware of the risk that ads may potentially display on websites of poor quality (nonpremium websites), managers have developed strategies to reduce this risk. Due to the lack of empirical insights, these strategies are based on “gut feeling” and depend on campaign type (branding versus performance) and brand type (premium versus nonpremium). Our research addresses this void and analyzes website quality effects for premium and nonpremium brands in branding and performance campaigns. Our results show that effects, indeed, vary depending on campaign and brand type, but not in ways that managers might expect. When a branding ad appears on a nonpremium website, attitudes towards the ad and the brand deteriorate, but only for premium brands. In contrast, website quality does not affect awareness for either type of brand. When a performance ad appears on a nonpremium website, it generates fewer clicks; this effect is stronger for premium brands.

Accordingly, gender (in)equality has proven to be an important determinant for the participation and the success of countries in international women's elite sport. Hence, differences in gender (in)equalitity, such as women's participation in the labor force, fertility rates, tradition of women suffrage or socio-economic status of women, could be linked to success in international women's elite sports. While major international sport governing bodies have created programs to subsidize the development of women's sports in member countries, gender equality has figured rather low within the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) (now World Athletics). Therefore, the paper examines the impact of gender (in)equality on country participation in international athletics on the base of a unique dataset on season's bests. The results provide further support that gender inequality matters and is associated with participation in women's elite sports. Whereas, women's participation in athletics has made considerable progress in the past two decades as a side-effect of the IAAF's decentralization strategy, the analyses illustrate the need for better targeted and better resourced development programs for increasing participation of less gender equal countries. Moreover, the analyses indicate the limitations of a pure macro-social approach as there are some rather unexpected dynamic developments, such as, the substantial progress of women's athletics in the Islamic Republic of Iran as a country with strong Muslim religious affiliation. The results from this analysis were used to provide practical implications.

One of the main debates is identifying the side or negative effects of the sharing economy as well as its positive effects. Studying the cause-effect relationship of the variables affecting sustainability in the sharing economy context can provide valuable results for firms. For this purpose, fuzzy cognitive maps have been used. Based on the literature review, the sharing economy's essential variables that affect sustainability were identified, and using the Fuzzy Delphi method, these variables were localized. Snapp and Tap30 were selected as two of the largest platforms in the Iranian transportation sector. Fuzzy cognitive maps based on aggregated opinions of experts were inputted to the Mental Modeler online software to drawn the cognitive map of this research. The degree of centrality index, i.e., the summation of input and output degree, was used to identify the most relevant sustainability variables. Consequently, the incentives to make a greater use of the platform, the income of drivers, the monopoly power of platforms, the price of services, the higher service quality of platforms, the use of private vehicles by passengers, and the change of traffic in cities were identified as variables with the greatest effect on stability. Four positive loops and one negative loop were identified among these seven variables in the cause-effect analysis. In the final section, some suggestions are presented based on each loop. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Fuzzy cognitive mapping; Fuzzy delphi method; Sharing economy; Sustainability; Transportation sector","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Fuzzy rules; Mapping; Sustainable development; Academic community; Cause-effect relationships; Cognitive maps; Fuzzy cognitive mappings; Fuzzy Delphi Method; Literature reviews; Localised; Online software; Sharing economy; Transportation sector; Cognitive systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106574413

In this study, the integrated analysis of life cycle assessment (LCA), emergy evaluation (EME) and economic analysis (ECA) were applied and Quanjiao county was selected as a case study to estimate the pollution emissions, emergy efficiency and economic benefits of three typical rice-based rotation systems depended on a detailed farming practice filed investigation of 157 valid samples under structured questionnaire. The three typical rice-based rotation systems are rice-wheat rotation (RW), rice-fallow rotation (RF) and rice-crayfish rotation (RC), respectively. The LCA results showed that the area-based potential environmental impact for RW, RF and RC are 34.08, 13.71 and 39.98, the profit-based potential environmental impacts are 2.62, 1.16 and 1.98. The EME results indicated that the RC shows the highest emergy input, around 1.23E+17 sej/ha/yr, more than that of RW and RF, around 3.88E+16 sej/ha/yr and 3.40E+16 sej/ha/yr, respectively. From the emergy indices of the three systems, the RC results in higher environmental pressure and lower sustainability compared with the RW and RF. Fertilizer, diesel oil, water, electricity and forage are the crucial factors of environmental consequences, herein forage, water and electricity inputs are becoming new factors that are increasingly prominent and often neglected. From an economic perspective, the cost and income of the RC are highest because of more input and higher sale value, the area-based profit of the RC (20142 ¥/ha) is higher than that of RF (11848 ¥/ha) and RW (13031 ¥/ha). Generally, during the rice planting system transferring, the development of farming technologies and standards should be promoted to avoid the disorder of agricultural production, and then gearing up to the better economic performance and environmental sustainability for the rice-based rotation systems. Moreover, proper agricultural development policies should be made and promoted to stimulate farmers’ willingness to adopt advanced farming practices and techniques to reduce environmental emissions and enhance agricultural system sustainability as well as increasing farmers' income. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic analysis; Ecosystem sustainability; Emergy evaluation; Environmental consequences; Life cycle assessment; Rice-based rotation","Cultivation; Environmental management; Life cycle; Profitability; River pollution; Rotation; Sustainable development; Area-based; Economics analysis; Ecosystem sustainability; Emergy evaluation; Environmental consequences; Environmental sustainability; Farming practices; Integrated analysis; Rice-based rotation; Rice-wheat rotations; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111052032

In response, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are seeking to enhance their capabilities for sustainable innovation and many have started to globalise their green efforts. But to what extent and how (if at all) do green Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) contribute to the deepening of sustainability capabilities? To address this question, we employ a novel dataset of 1217 green FDI in renewable energy sectors worldwide, during the period 1997 to 2015. A propensity score matching and difference-in-difference econometric strategy provides three main results. First, green FDIs enhance the overall orientation to sustainability of MNEs. They have both a greening effect on the firms’ overall technology bases and increases specialization in specific green technologies. Second, green FDIs have a significant positive impact on the degree and quality of MNEs innovative capacity in sustainable technologies. In other words, the MNEs extend their innovative capabilities towards more sustainability-oriented direction and strengthen their innovation activities related to green technologies. Third, we find that the globalisation process mode matters: in the long run, green FDIs result in newly-established subsidiaries contributing more to innovativeness and greening than acquisition of foreign firms. These findings have important implications for policies designed to increase the sustainability transition. © 2021","Foreign direct investments; Global connectedness; Green innovation; Multinational enterprises; Renewable energy; Sustainability transition","Economics; Sustainable development; Enterprise IS; Foreign direct investments; Global connectedness; Global economies; Green innovations; Green technology; Multinational enterprise; Renewable energies; Renewable energy sector; Sustainability transition; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107618682

One of its critical success factors is the proper management of its supply chain (SC). Recently, significant research attention has been focused on the modelling of OSC-SC to improve its performance and sustainability. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive review of the modelling studies on off-site construction -supply chain management (OSC-SCM). Therefore, this research contributes by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date mapping and clustering of 309 journal articles on the modelling of OSC-SC to identify its trends and gaps, and hence, highlight future research opportunities. To achieve these objectives, a mixed review method, consisting of scientometric and systematic reviews, is used. The scientometric review identifies the most prolific journals, researchers, co-occurrence network of keywords, and their citation bursts. On the other hand, the systematic review classifies the articles based on OSC type and supply chain (SC) stage. At each SC stage, the articles are further classified based on problem settings and solution methods. The results show that production problems have received the most attention (i.e., by 28% of the included articles), followed by on-site construction (19%), design (13%), and logistics (7%) problems. However, researchers are more inclined to address problems at multiple SC stages (33%) due to the interrelationship between these stages. Besides, the systematic analysis shows that OSC-SC problems have been solved frequently by a variety of solution methods such as optimization (25%), simulation (13%) and building information modelling (BIM) (9.5%). However, researchers tend more to integrate multiple solution methods (35%) to address the complexities of OSC-SC problems. Finally, the included studies are classified based on the three sustainability dimensions. The results show that economic, environmental, and social sustainability dimensions have been considered in previous studies by 72%, 24%, and 4%, respectively. Therefore, the study identifies research gaps at each SC stage of each OSC type to incentivize future studies to consider more environmental and social sustainability factors in OSC-SC models. Since modular integrated construction (MiC) has the highest prefabrication level, this study provides future research directions for sustainable supply chain management (SCM) in MiC. The present research is an important reference guide that helps researchers and practitioners to understand different problem settings and their solution methods in OSC-SCM. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Literature review; Logistics; Modelling; Modular integrated construction; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Architectural design; Logistics; Supply chain management; Chain management; Construction supply chain; Construction supply chain management; Literature reviews; Modeling; Modular integrated construction; Modulars; Off-site construction; Scientometrics; Solution methods; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106365875

Nine healthy adult habitually strength-training individuals were investigated. Motion analysis and inverse dynamics-based musculoskeletal modelling were used to compute joint loads, muscle forces, and muscle activities. Total exercise load (resultant ground reaction force; rGRF) and the knee-extension net joint moment (NJM) were slightly and considerably greater, respectively, in squat than in leg press (p ≤ 0.04), whereas the hip-extension NJM was moderately greater in leg press than in squat (p = 0.03). Leg press was performed at 11° deeper knee-flexion angle than squat (p = 0.01). Quadriceps muscle activity was similar in squat and leg press. Both exercise modalities showed slightly to moderately greater force in the vastii muscles during the eccentric than concentric phase of a repetition (p ≤ 0.05), indicating eccentric overload. That the quadriceps muscle activity was similar in squat and leg press, while rGRF and NJM about the knee were greater in squat than leg press, may, together with the finding of a propensity to perform leg press at deeper knee angle than squat, suggest that leg press is the preferable leg-extension resistance exercise, both from a training efficacy and injury risk perspective.

Importantly, this relation is verified for healthy foods (i.e., dark chocolate presented as healthy, organic apricots) but not for unhealthy foods (i.e., caramelized apricots). The results of this work contribute to extending knowledge about the influence of package on food perceptions, finding another driver of taste estimation bias, namely sustainability.

The question is explored in an empirical study of identification processes among Moroccan members of an international association that assemble young leaders and entrepreneurs in small- and medium sized companies. On the basis of a narrative analysis of interviews, observations, and documents, the article illustrates two mutually reinforcing identification processes: One is based on face-to-face social interaction with likeminded peers locally; another is imaginary in the sense that the Moroccan members envision members in other countries to be like themselves and what they aspire to become. This contributes to crosscultural management literature in three ways: first, the study adopts a transnational lens that shows the need to go beyond a national perspective and to explore identification at the intersection between the global and local; second, the study draws on concepts of imagined community (Anderson, 1983) and community of sentiments (Appadurai, 1996) to conceptualise the imaginary part of the identification processes, which transcends locality. Third, the study contributes methodologically by showing how the distinction between translocal and local narratives allows to analyse the interplay between an imagined transnational community and a local face-to-face community. © The Author(s) 2021.","Business association; entrepreneur; imagined community; Morocco; narrative analysis; organisational identification processes; qualitative case study; transnational",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113253332

Up until now, we have had very little knowledge of disciplinary similarities and differences in QRPs. The paper is the first systematic account of variances and similarities. It reports on the findings of a comprehensive study comprising 22 focus groups on practices and perceptions of QRPs across main areas of research. The paper supports the relevance of the idea of epistemic cultures (Knorr Cetina in: Epistemic cultures: how the sciences make knowledge, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1999), also when it comes to QRPs. It shows which QRPs researchers from different areas of research (humanities, social sciences, medical sciences, natural sciences, and technical sciences) report as the most severe and prevalent within their fields. Furthermore, it shows where in the research process these self-reported QRPs can be found. This is done by using a five-phase analytical model of the research process (idea generation, research design, data collection, data analysis, scientific publication and reporting). The paper shows that QRPs are closely connected to the distinct research practices within the different areas of research. Many QRPs can therefore only be found within one area of research, and QRPs that cut across main areas often cover relatively different practices. In a few cases, QRPs in one area are considered good research practice in another. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Disciplinary differences; Epistemic culture; QRP; Research integrity; Research Misconduct; Responsible conduct of research","human; medical research; personnel; publication; scientific misconduct; self report; university; Biomedical Research; Humans; Publications; Research Personnel; Scientific Misconduct; Self Report; Universities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108155975

However, existing methodologies are somewhat limited in scope as they do not possess mechanisms for correctly identifying non-measurable, indirect results and impacts. This study addresses these knowledge shortcomings, and it proposes and validates an alternative method to identify the social, environmental, and economic outcomes and indirect impacts of STI projects. Findings indicate that the proposed method helps fills the gaps in knowledge about ex-post methodologies used to evaluate indirect results and impacts in STI projects. One aspect that sets the proposed method apart from the existing approaches is that it contemplates a wide range of analytical categories of indirect impacts for assessing the effects of STI projects. The principal academic and practical contribution of this study is the development of an accessible artifact that can identify the results and indirect impacts of projects in diverse areas of STI.

However, context is often taken for granted rather than being viewed as an asset, which may lead to missed opportunities, missed potential solutions and missed learning. Entrepreneurship education should therefore prepare and empower students to act entrepreneurially in their individual, unique context. A student-centric pedagogical approach is required to build this metacognitive understanding and enable students to ultimately self-manage their own process, embedded in and influenced by context. This paper presents a framework, the Context Hive, which enables students to understand and work with the impact of context on their entrepreneurial activity. The Context Hive translates entrepreneurship and context theories into educational (and entrepreneurial) practice by structuring complexity and uncertainty in ways that help students to better grasp, adapt or adjust to contextual elements. Using the research-based framework facilitates dialogue, builds awareness and enables prioritization of actions based on contextual analysis. In this way, the classroom is no longer limited to one perspective and educator and student share responsibility for how learning is designed, which provides a means for educators and students to raise awareness of how context influences entrepreneurial activity, making it navigable. © The Author(s) 2021.","Action-based; context; entrepreneurship education; learning; student-centric",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108004286

By applying a critical discourse analysis, findings reveal that the production, distribution, and consumption of the EDI discourse are pervaded by a dynamic tension in the power relation between the top-level management and employees.

This approach has been a welcome alternative when understanding sustainable consumption compared with relying on individualistic psychological or identity-communicative approaches. However, with the shift towards a practice theoretical approach, there has been a tendency to ignore variation in consumer practices. Specifically, questions regarding the extent to which ethical concern can explain variance have not yet been included. Important questions, such as whether and how ethics takes part in changing practices in more sustainable directions, have similarly been neglected. This theoretically based article intends to contribute to further developing theories of practice by bringing together three discussions: how variation in carrying and performing practices can be conceptualised, how different approaches to consumption have conceptualised ethics and how ethics of care and the concept of general understandings can be used to conceptualise ethical aspects of consumption within theories of practice. The article concludes by summarising the findings from these discussions and raising questions of further empirical and theoretical concern. © The Author(s) 2021.","Consumption; ethics; everyday life; sustainable consumption; theories of practice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105973628

The proposed analytical approach uses open secondary data and content analysis to collect and analyse the sustainability and service innovation activities of a sample of firms. It also develops the Sustainability-orientated Service Innovation (SOSI) Matrix, a tool to map the firms’ strategies and their contribution to the SDGs. The results indicate that the various combinations of sustainability and service innovation strategies lead to differences in the firms’ contribution to the SDGs. In particular, service innovation has been shown to be a fundamental mediator to contribute to the SDGs. The main points of this work are i) the importance of combining sustainability and service innovation to contribute to the SDGs; ii) the development of an analytical procedure to analyse the firms’ contribution to the SDGs; iii) the definition of core SDGs, which are relevant in aligning firm's value-creation to SDGs’ contribution.

This study of stakeholder inclusion in scenario planning for policy making reflects on four detailed key arenas. We first investigate the concept of stakeholders and how the scenario planning literature considers them. We explore the different types of relevant actors to include in a participatory scenario process, and we probe which methods are used to identify stakeholders to engage. Second, we investigate the role or function of stakeholders in the scenario planning process and find that stakeholder involvement has specific and detailed functions in particular phases of scenario planning.

Taking an interactional approach to authentic leadership (AL) and using naturally occurring workplace interaction as data, we seek to question two basic assumptions of AL scholarship, namely (1) that authentic leadership emanates from the atomized leader and (2) that there is a causal logic to it so that authentic leadership behaviours are the cause of follower outcomes. Addressing the research questions – what is the nature of the empirical phenomenon that is called AL and where can this be ontologically located? – our findings indicate that these two fundamental assumptions that underpin current AL research are not justified. Rather, what is taken to be AL is better understood as a collective and collaborative achievement, which can neither simply be attributed to the leader nor can the leader’s actions alone lead to follower outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.","authentic leadership; behaviour; conversation analysis; interaction; questionnaires",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105444611

Our multiple case study analysis (on three ‘hard’ and five ‘soft’ service firms) of born global firms differentiates between the internationalization pathways of these firms. We show that ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ service-based born global firms have different internationalization drivers, target different foreign markets, and have distinct entry modes in these markets.

While some expect such open-source hardware (OSH) to lead to transformational changes in the ways technologies are produced, the available empirical evidence suggests that, to date, the diffusion of most OSH applications has been modest. In this paper, we focus on the limited uptake of OSH and study factors that help explain its adoption by users who replicate available open-source designs. Given our limited understanding of this topic, we present an in-depth study of small wind turbines based on open designs. Through a systematic review of the case-specific literature, we identify and analyse 60 documents, including case studies, construction manuals, market analyses, and technical assessments. We find that the adoption of available open-source wind turbine designs by technology users depends on a number of factors that are currently underemphasized in discussions on the potential of OSH. This includes the quality of OSH self-manufactured products, the particular motivations of adopters to engage with OSH, the availability of adequate production inputs for local manufacturing, and the resources available through open-source communities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Open-source; Open-source hardware; Small wind turbines; Technology adoption; Technology diffusion","Manufacture; Open systems; Wind turbines; Manufactured products; Number of factors; Open source communities; Open-source hardwares; Small wind turbine; Systematic Review; Technical assessment; Turbine designs; Open source software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104976674

The extraordinary events of Day Zero raised the specter of Mad Max–style water wars. They also led to the development of new forms of solidarity, with water acting as a social leveler. The article argues that events in Cape Town open a window onto the future, to the extent that they tell us something about what happens when the added stresses of climate change are mapped onto already-contested social and political situations. They also underline the precarious nature of many of our urban arrangements.

In our sample of 489 Italian family firms experiencing the departure of non-family CEOs, these successions represent 42% of all cases. Our difference-in-differences results indicate that family firms undertaking Type-R successions experience an 18% superiority in profitability. Exploring the heterogeneity underlying this result, we find that Type-R successions produce weaker results in contexts that are highly volatile and that rely on innovative inputs before succession. Finally, in studying the drivers of the performance increase, we find that Type-R successions reduce labor costs and spur efficiency. Collectively, our evidence suggests that Type-R successions improve performance by leveraging family assets while avoiding dysfunctional nepotism and other parochial family priorities. Managerial Summary: How does CEO succession affect family business performance? In this article, we study an unexplored yet common succession pattern in mature family firms—the appointment of a family member following the tenure of an outside CEO. Surprisingly, we find that when, after a period of professional leadership, a family CEO returns to lead the company; the firm exhibits an 18% advantage in profitability. This result is more prevalent in stable industries, where traditional family assets prove especially valuable. A key takeaway of our study is that family leadership can enhance performance in companies that have already professionalized their governance, and thus have learned to reconcile meritocratic principles with family-based assets. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CEO succession; family business; leadership; performance","Wages; Difference-in-differences; Family business; Family firms; Firm Performance; Improve performance; In contexts; Labor costs; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101882604

Today, a multiplicity of entrepreneurial approaches exists, cf. skunk work, bricolage, bootlegging. However, these exists in disparate literature, that provides limited oversight to managers in, that need to select between a manifold of different entrepreneurial strategies. Moreover, these approaches typically originate from a distinctively different organizational context, namely SMEs. Through a literature review we identify two important axiomatic assumptions concerning entrepreneurial strategies within the organizational conditions of MNCs. The first fundamental assumption concerns the organizational origin of such effort. The second theoretical assumption deals with how the entrepreneurial initiative can meet either organizational resistance or support. We synthesize these two dimensions into a two-by-two matrix, that provides an answer to our research question: what are the critical dimensions for entrepreneurial strategies in an MNC context? We then employ this typology to categorize predominant entrepreneurial strategies in current literature, to create a overview that can be used both for structuring the debate in the literature; as well as a basis to discuss important implicit assumptions, that should guide the selection of entrepreneurial strategy in a MNC context in practice. © The Author(s) 2020.","bootlegging; bricolage; guided evolution; intrapreneurship; MNC; skunk works",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097999139

While it is somewhat harder to find evidence of finite-sample predictive gains relative to the benchmark, the evidence is stronger with respect to population-level predictability 1 quarter (1 month) ahead for the model with crude oil price realized semivolatilities across the considered data and models.

This editorial is an attempt to provide an overview and hopefully a clarification. We propose to use the concept ‘societal value’ as the overarching concept. This can be achieved only if the research has ‘societal relevance’ and if it has ‘societal impact’. These two sub-components of societal value measure different qualities, but they are dependent on each other and the total absence of one of them results in no societal value. In fact, we shall argue that societal value is the multiplum of societal relevance and societal impact. After defining societal relevance and societal impact, we describe how to identify relevant societal value, as well as how to measure the extent to which an individual or an organization might contribute to societal value.

While the business case frame assumes that developing eco-friendly solutions can benefit firms financially, this article highlights the importance of challenging established understandings of sustainability. To this end, I introduce Deleuze’s distinction between morality and ethics. Morality involves passing judgements on the basis of values. Ethics provides an immanent evaluation of the principles by which specific solutions are considered sustainable. Analysing interviews with architects, building engineers and business developers, the article shows how these actors reflect on the values that form the basis of their practice, but also try to imagine new ways of working with sustainability. In conclusion, the article suggests that an immanent ethics of organizational environmentalism can allow for the values that inform environmental efforts in organizations to be evaluated as well as alternative visions of sustainability to be created. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Immanent ethics; Organizational environmentalism; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077189612

Historically, sales of beauty products in India had been limited by high taxation, restricted consumer choice, and high levels of poverty; post-liberalization, the country was therefore seen as a market with immense, albeit untapped, potential. However, even as beauty industry reports tout the potential for growth, nearly three decades after liberalization, per capita sales of beauty products continue to be some of the lowest in the world. Little is known about why beauty products remain stubbornly resistant to aspirational marketing efforts. Meanwhile, scant social scientific attention has been paid to the creation and marketing of tastes and desires by the beauty industry in India and women’s engagement with those desires. In this article, we present ethnographic depth on how local beauty cultures affect understandings of bodily aesthetics to create hybrid beauty practices and on how marketing efforts seek to channel these practices into consumer behavior. We examine some of the major points of contingent difference linked to low volumes of cosmetics sales in India and explore the approaches adopted by advertisers and marketers of beauty products to convert such difference into new imaginaries that foster mass consumption. © The Author(s) 2018.","Beauty work; consumption; globalization; India; makeup; marketing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058841637

A central feature of the intervention, called ENERGISE Living Labs and conducted across eight European countries, was that social practices were targeted, resulting in a focus on what ‘heating is for’ rather than the process of heating in and of itself. In this article, we concentrate on the three countries with the highest reported expectations of thermal comfort and describe how 113 households in Denmark, Finland and Hungary completed a set of challenges to reduce their indoor temperature to 18 °C for four weeks in the late autumn of 2018. To facilitate alternative ways of keeping warm, the participants were supported by reflexive interviews and group discussions, and aided by tips and materials. The results demonstrate how changes in skills, competences, norms, and expectations related to indoor thermal comfort (in addition to other daily practices) are essential for more sufficient energy use. Generally, the temperature level at which people felt comfortable was reduced by an average of 1 °C, and, more importantly, participants became aware of their heating-related practices, including the underlying elements of these practices, and learned how to challenge them. The results clearly indicate the potential of practice-based interventions to promote deliberation on and change in existing socially shared expectations of comfort. © 2021 The Author(s)","Comfort; Energy consumption; Households; Indoor space heating; Intervention; Social practices","Space heating; Thermal comfort; Comfort; Denmark; Energy-consumption; Finland; Household; Hungary; Indoor space heating; Intervention; Social practices; Thermal; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105490698

Section 3 discusses the characteristics of an “ideal” IFRS experiment that would allow to draw causal inferences on the effects of IFRS adoption. We offer a comprehensive overview of research on the impact of IFRS on capital markets, particularly around first-time adoption and during the global financial crisis. In Section 4, we describe current IFRS reporting practices, including digital reporting (XBRL), and benchmark the availability, accessibility, and processing of IFRS financial information against the information environment in the United States. We complement this discussion by evidence on the use of IFRS reporting choices such as the different fair value options. Section 5 provides information about important institutional features of IFRS standard setting and how political powers affect decisions on IFRS adoption, standard setting, and enforcement. The monograph concludes with an assessment of the impact of IFRS research and outlines emerging trends that provide opportunities for future research. Overall, this monograph offers a summary of research findings and methods that are relevant for the analysis of future regulatory innovations, such as the international standardization of sustainability (or ESG) reporting. © 2021 NOW.

This approach combines understandings from the CCO (Communication as Constitutive of Organization) perspective with the branding literature. The author outlines the evolution of corporate branding theory that has developed from an identity approach rooted in signalling theory to an understanding of brands as co-created by multiple stakeholders. She then develops and elaborates the latter approach by formulating and explicating the CCB approach, within which a brand is conceptualized as a discursive brand space grounded in a performative and interactional ontology. Brand discourses are produced in a number of conversational spaces inhabited by both human and non-human actors. Seeing that non-human actors have agency, hybrid agency and ventriloquism are key notions in the CCB approach, and the role of the brand manager is to function as a practical author. The CCB approach is explicated and sustained by five chapters that each elaborate on a certain aspect of CCB and demonstrate the theoretical points in a number of analyses (the process of brand creation, the set-up of conversational spaces, the role of materiality and macro-actors, frame games, and the brand manager as a practical author). The data in the analyses originates from a case that is used throughout the book.

This paper studied three large-scale mesophilic digesters (D1–D3) over two years for their effects on feedstocks, which were dairy manure for D1 and D2 and co-digestion mixed manure and agro-industrial wastes for D3. Hydraulic retention times (HRT) were 9 d for D1, 12 d for D2, and 34 d for D3. Digester influent and effluent samples were taken every two months from the digesters and analyzed for pH, and concentrations of total solids (TS), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus (TP), and eight metals. The study revealed high variability in converting feedstock in the three digesters. Compared with their respective influent, the mean digester effluent pH decreased from 7.9 by 0.6 in D1 (p &lt; 0.01) and by 0.3 in D2 (p &lt; 0.01), but it increased from 6.1 by 1.8 in D3 (p &lt; 0.01).

All three digesters significantly increased NH4-N concentrations by 21.4–81.8% (p &lt; 0.05), but insignificantly changed TKN and TP concentrations (p &gt; 0.05). Effects of AD on all metal concentrations were mixed and were insignificant (p &gt; 0.05) because of large concentration variations. However, study of a ratio quotient (qMg) using magnesium (Mg) as the reference discovered accumulation of NH4-N, copper, potassium, and sodium, but loss of TKN, TP, iron, manganese, zinc, and calcium during AD for D2 and D3. The impact of AD conversion was closely related with types of feedstock (on pH) and HRT (on TS and NH4-N). The results of this study can assist in developing strategies for cleaner production using AD in an environmentally sustainable manner. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ammonium nitrogen; Anaerobic digestion; Effluent; Metals; Nutrients; Total solids","Anaerobic digestion; Animals; Effluents; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Industrial wastes; Manures; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Agroindustrial wastes; Ammonium nitrogen; Anaerobics; Hydraulic retention; Mesophilic; NH$-4$/$++$/ N; Organic fertilizers; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Total phosphorus; Total solids; Metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105276939

From strategic and leadership changes to policy and health management decisions, abstract ideas such as 'LEAN', 'CSR', 'Sustainability', 'Public-Private Partnerships', 'Clinical Pathways' and 'AI' are introduced to improve organizational processes. However, in any company and organization, miscommunication and misinterpretation can lead to these ideas being modified, added to and appropriated in ways that make them unsuccessful. This book presents a case for change ideas in organizations being translated rather than ""implemented"" and offers a profound understanding of the translation processes needed in order for this to succeed.

These solutions were developed to relieve the issue of rigid data structures present in relational databases, by introducing semi-structured and flexible schema design. As current data generated by different sources and devices, especially from IoT sensors and actuators, use either XML or JSON format, depending on the application, database technologies that store and query semi-structured data in XML format are needed. Thus, Native XML Databases, which were initially designed to manipulate XML data using standardized querying languages, i.e., XQuery and XPath, were rebranded as NoSQL Document-Oriented Databases Systems. Currently, the majority of these solutions have been replaced with the more modern JSON based Database Management Systems. However, we believe that XML-based solutions can still deliver performance in executing complex queries on heterogeneous collections. Unfortunately nowadays, research lacks a clear comparison of the scalability and performance for database technologies that store and query documents in XML versus the more modern JSON format.

The purpose of this article is therefore to analyse how cities and municipalities can support and facilitate the circular economy through multiple modes of governance, e.g. through the use of own assets to support the circular economy; the use of the ownership of utilities and waste companies to support the circular economy; the use of rule enforcement and/or economic regulation or through facilitating, coordinating, collaborating and encouraging. The analysis in the article is based on two in-depth case studies of projects seeking circular economies, in which Danish municipalities collaborated with local stakeholders to close the material loop for demolition materials and textile waste. Overall, this study is based on an action research approach that emphasises the benefits of co-innovation processes carried out between multiple stakeholders. The analysis of the case studies concluded that municipalities can function as an important change agent to support and facilitate a transformation towards a circular economy. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Demolition; Governance; Recycling; Textile; Waste","Recycling; Textiles; Case-studies; Circular economy; Governance; Governance forms; Level transition; Local modes; Multiple modes; Research fields; Textile recycling; Utilities companies; Demolition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104919271

Analyzing Danish registry data, we find that employees hired by startups earn roughly 17% less over the next 10 years than those hired by large, established firms. About half of this earnings differential stems from sorting-from the fact that startup employees have less human capital. Long-term earnings also vary depending on when individuals are hired. Although the earliest employees of startups suffer an earnings penalty, those hired by already-successful startups earn a small premium. Two factors appear to account for the earnings penalties for the early employees: Startups fail at high rates, creating costly spells of unemployment for their (former) employees. Job-mobility patterns also diverge: After being employed by a small startup, individuals rarely return to the large employers that pay more.

We then explore the relationship between optimism and the effectiveness of innovation. Exploiting unique firm-level data and a laboratory experiment involving 205 entrepreneurs, we find that dispositional optimism is negatively associated with both the likelihood and extent of belief updating in response to negative feedback. Furthermore, dispositional optimism triggers a discrepancy- between innovation inputs and outputs-that reduces a firm's innovation effectiveness. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

Our findings are based on an extensive coding of 11,041 newspaper articles over a 10-year period in Denmark and Flanders (Belgium) regarding 40 agencies.

However, these approaches differ in their conceptualizations and, despite their popularity, the empirical evidence on the performance relevance of such approaches for established organizations is limited. In this research, we propose rapid validity testing (RVT), in which we conceptualize and harmonize existing approaches toward a unique and comprehensive set of front-end activities necessary to reduce uncertainty and equivocality inherent to this phase and enable planned flexibility. Drawing on information processing theory, we argue that organizations implementing RVT also increase the probability of achieving innovation outcomes of superior quality on time and within budget. We further argue that the effectiveness of RVT depends upon internal and external environmental factors. Drawing on multirespondent data collected from 1022 informants in 129 firms, we find empirical evidence that organizations implementing the RVT approach in their innovation activities achieve higher performance of their innovation programs, and that the performance relevance of RVT depends upon technological turbulence and the organization's long-term orientation and risk propensity. We contribute to the literature by conceptualizing RVT as a set of activities that enable planned flexibility. Furthermore, we overcome empirical shortcomings of studies on popular approaches that relied primarily on anecdotal or case study evidence and imply the generalizability of their effectiveness. Our findings highlight that organizations indeed not only benefit from RVT but also challenge the notion of a one-size-fits-all approach to the front end of innovation. © 2021 The Authors.

Drawing on a multi-sited ethnographic study in three Danish child welfare agencies, the analysis clarifies the multiple purposes of deliberation in everyday practice and shows how deliberation is enabled and structured by formalized and informal deliberative organizational routines. Findings show that deliberation may influence individual decision-making or amount to collective decision-making. Depending on how deliberative organizational routines are enacted, deliberation may serve to enhance professional judgment, ensure appropriate justification for decisions, and alleviate uncertainty and emotional strain. Yet, while deliberation represents a productive form of collective coping, deliberative routines may also obscure transparency and reify dysfunctional group dynamics.

Using the “Big Five” framework and a sample of elected politicians, we conduct two studies showing how personality is associated with policymaker tolerance of the administrative burdens that social welfare recipients experience. Politicians with high conscientiousness are more tolerant of burdens, suggesting that they expect similar attention to detail from others. Conversely, politicians who score higher on the trait of openness to experience are less tolerant of burdens, implying that greater empathy toward the experience of others reduces burden tolerance.

This article is based on interviews with her about vulnerability and ways of coping with the pandemic’s effects as the sole caregiver and breadwinner for her 4-year-old child. Her ways of dealing with this chain of severe, life-changing events inspired us to analyze her case through Judith Butler’s feminist lens of vulnerability, conceptualized as the very source of resistance. The results of the analysis illustrate vulnerability and emergent modes of resistance as gendered responsibilities of giving and receiving care, as well as the power of solidarity. Furthermore, the study shows how the political, social, and economic context of Russia shapes gendered experiences of vulnerability and possibilities for resistance. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","care; COVID-19; resistance; Russia; vulnerability","coping strategy; COVID-19; feminism; gender role; vulnerability; womens employment; womens health; womens status; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106276167

This paper presents a theoretical model of the effect of democracy and uses laboratory experiments to test a key prediction emerging from the model, namely that the effect of democracy is stronger in small than in large communities. Results from a prisoner's dilemma experiment show that an effect of democracy is present in groups of all sizes but decreases strongly and becomes less persistent as the number of group members increases. In some respects, therefore, democracy appears to work best in small groups. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Democracy; Experiment; Group size; Signaling; Social dilemma; Social preferences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106252225

The purpose of this research study is to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of cloud computing in Sub-Saharan Africa under Ethiopian higher education. These factors professed to influence the adoption of cloud computing built on the integrated framework of technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, diffusion of innovation (DoI) theory, and sociocultural theory. In-depth interviews have been taken with the University of Gondar key professionals in Ethiopia to accomplish this research study. The results show that the organisational factors are more influential factors than the technological, environmental, and sociocultural factors to the adoption of cloud computing (CC) in the Ethiopian higher education (EHE) sector. This qualitative study aids researchers and practitioners in the field of IT technology cloud to employ these key factors suggestive to cloud computing adoption in the higher educational institutions.

Not only the analytic approach but also the operationalizations of key variables were left unconstrained and up to individual analysts. For instance, analysts could choose to operationalize status as job title, institutional ranking, citation counts, or some combination. To maximize transparency regarding the process by which analytic choices are made, the analysts used a platform we developed called DataExplained to justify both preferred and rejected analytic paths in real time. Analyses lacking sufficient detail, reproducible code, or with statistical errors were excluded, resulting in 29 analyses in the final sample. Researchers reported radically different analyses and dispersed empirical outcomes, in a number of cases obtaining significant effects in opposite directions for the same research question. A Boba multiverse analysis demonstrates that decisions about how to operationalize variables explain variability in outcomes above and beyond statistical choices (e.g., covariates). Subjective researcher decisions play a critical role in driving the reported empirical results, underscoring the need for open data, systematic robustness checks, and transparency regarding both analytic paths taken and not taken.

These hypotheses are tested through the Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM) using data from the 6th International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS-VI) conducted in manufacturing assembly plants in 22 countries around the globe. The results show that country of origin and operation do not moderate the relationship between stakeholder pressures and the adoption of sustainability practices, while they have a moderating effect on the relationship between sustainability practices and performance. Studies that investigate the associations between stakeholder pressures, the adoption of sustainability practices and performance are relatively scarce and not quite conclusive. Several scholars have called for studies on the role of contextual variables. The country context in which a firm is embedded is important for understanding firms’ behavior, yet very often neglected.

This study aims to evaluate the probability of anaerobically digested biowaste to qualify as organic fertilizer, within the framework of the EU fertilizer Regulation. The parameters investigated are the heavy metal and nutrient content of the solid and liquid fertilizers, and soil improvers. Two collection systems for the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) are assessed, i.e., source-separation (SS) and mechanical separation (MS) from unsorted waste. A modelling tool is developed for calculating the quality of the digestate, purposed as organic fertilizer, based on feedstock data. Four scenarios of biogas production efficiencies are modelled (60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% of volatile solids removal) to cover the different anaerobic digestion configurations. A Monte Carlo simulation is applied to estimate the probability of exceeding the regulatory limits for heavy metal concentration in organic fertilizers. The statistical analysis of the biowaste illustrates that the quality of the SS-OFMSW is higher than the MS-OFMSW. The Monte Carlo simulation shows that the SS-OFMSW digestate has 18% probability of exceeding the regulatory limit value for Cadmium and less than 10% for the rest of the heavy metals. The MS-OFMSW digestate illustrates a higher risk that ranges from 11% to 51%. The study justifies the explicit exclusion of the MS-OFMSW from the positive list of inputs for the production of organic fertilizers in the circular economy market. High quality organic fertilizers can contribute to closing the nutrient loop by returning them on agricultural soil while safeguarding soil health and food safety. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Mechanical separation; Modelling tool; Organic fertilizers; Source-separation","Anaerobic digestion; Fertilizers; Heavy metals; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Municipal solid waste; Nutrients; Probability; Quality control; Separation; Soils; Anaerobics; Biowastes; Collection systems; Digestate; Mechanical separation; Modelling tools; Monte Carlo's simulation; Organic fertilizers; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Regulatory limit; Source separation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105606125

On the other hand, innovation capabilities both in terms of introducing new products and new services are of outmost importance to gain competitive advantage. Technology adoption and firm innovativeness are often interrelated, but this relation is not well understood, and in particular, the way in which digital technology adoption, product and service innovation, and competitive advantage are related to process industries has not yet been investigated. This paper develops and operationalizes a conceptual framework for product and service innovation, thereby incorporating digital technology adoption. Through an exploratory study, using quantitative data from the European Manufacturing Survey (EMS)-2015, we analyze data from 747 cases in the process industries from D, NL, A, CH, and DK. Our main findings show that companies with higher levels of digital technology implementation (breadth and depth) can introduce more radical product and service innovations. Companies with both radical innovations and service innovation make significantly greater use of their implemented technologies’ potential. Radical product innovation also yields higher returns on sales, but contrary to our assumptions, service innovation in process industries does not. We find that, in the low-tech sectors, digital technologies are used to generate product and services innovations which then translate into higher performance. In contrast, in the high-tech sectors, digital technologies have a direct impact on performance and are thus rather accustomed to realizing the efficiency gains not primarily used for innovation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Process-industry; Product innovation; Service innovation; Technology adoption","Behavioral research; Competition; Manufacture; Competitive advantage; Conceptual frameworks; European manufacturing; European manufacturing surveys; Innovation capability; Product and service innovations; Product and services; Radical product innovations; Service industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105603929

The mold featured two concentric guide pillars on opposite sides of the parting plane and rectangular centering block elements at three locations. Mold displacements at the parting plane were measured through the incorporation of three eddy-current linear displacement sensors. Thermal error sensitivity was investigated using FEM simulations such that the induced variability from thermal expansion and filling phase was identified and quantified. Finally, molded component warpage was isolated and quantified, again by the means of FEM simulation.

But most empirical studies within public administration of the relationship between expectations and satisfaction indicate that expectations have little-to-no net effect on satisfaction. We argue that these results may be largely driven by the weaknesses of existing measurement approaches and inattention in many studies to the distinction between two types of expectations: those about what should happen (normative expectations) versus those about what will happen (predictive expectations). Distinguishing between these two types of expectations is important because they are likely to have different - and perhaps even opposite - effects on satisfaction. We recruited 972 US residents via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to complete a survey vignette experiment and found that normative expectations are strongly (and negatively) related to satisfaction levels, whereas predictive expectations are barely related to satisfaction at all. We also find that comparative performance information generally has a much stronger effect on predictive expectations than on normative expectations. These findings suggest that theories of satisfaction should more consistently distinguish between different types of expectations. Our results also leave us somewhat optimistic about the ability of ordinary residents to follow a reasonable process when assigning normative meaning to performance information. © 2020 The Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104756938

As silicon carbide slurries may include sintering aids, different functional groups, molecular weight, and stabilization mechanisms were considered for the dispersants to be able to stabilize both slurry components. Additionally, pH effect, toxicity, additive compatibility, and foaming properties were considered, giving all the necessary information for developing new aqueous formulation of SiC suspensions, including advantages and disadvantages of the different candidates. Different de-agglomeration procedures, powder surface area, and calcination temperature were also considered to study the effect of the SiC surface properties. The outcome is that slurry stabilization provided by an alkaline environment at pH larger than 8‒9 is significantly more effective than slurry stabilization by any of the tested dispersants. Alkaline environments facilitate a negative surface charge on SiC particles and provide a stable electrostatic stabilization mechanism not observed in neutral or acidic environments.

The results revealed that the project managers perceived different needs and goals within the context of smart city innovation and realization. The project managers perception of smart city was mainly within a smart economy and smart governance perspective. However, the project managers also criticized the relatively less focus on public participations and dialogue-oriented smart city solutions.

The article contributes to the literature on household innovation by illustrating how social movement motivations may differ from motivations examined in prior studies focused on self-rewards, as well as examining the implications for free innovations and diffusion patterns in this setting. Social movement innovators are typically motivated by a common cause (such as a quest for a new life order and societal change) and create innovations that address a cause and “system change” rather than individual goals. I identify and define three types of social movement innovation: behavioral, product, and symbolic innovation. The common-cause motivation also creates a new form of diffusion problem that can only be solved through the spread and consumption of new products, behaviors, or techniques by a sufficiently large crowd. Common-cause motivations should thus encourage innovation diffusion, thereby reducing the risk of the diffusion-failure problem usually observed in household innovation research. © 2021","Behavioral innovation; Common-cause motivations; Diffusion; Product innovation; Social movements; Symbolic innovation","Motivation; Diffusion patterns; Diffusion problems; Failure problems; Innovation diffusion; Innovation research; Social movements; Societal changes; System change; Diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103368697

Especially in the pharmaceutical industry, where a product's quality has to be ensured at all costs, a large amount of false rejects is acceptable to guarantee the integrity of all released products. As standard quality control systems mainly perform a binary classification, most of them do not provide insights about the reason behind rejections. As a result, the underlying reason for the rejects, such as degradation in equipment or wrong settings in process parameters, often goes unnoticed. Yet, these systems are based on conservative approaches that incorporate the uncertainties related to the measurement system and process variation such as batch-to-batch variations and assembly tolerances. In this contribution, a new data-driven quality control system is suggested. The system is based on well-established machine learning methods that differentiate multiple types of errors in the assembly processes of medical products. Trained on process data, the system's functionality is demonstrated in a pre-study and two real industrial use cases. Moreover, application-specific differences are discussed.

The concept constitutes an important sustainability-oriented innovation practice contributing to waste reduction and efficient resource use. However, while the literature focuses primarily on the technical side, there is little research on societal and economic implications, or the consumer perspective of such value creation. This paper addresses this lack through a systematic review of empirical consumer research on waste-to-value in food and drink from the past ten years, and provides suggestions for further research directions. It is concluded that acceptance of waste-to-value food products among consumers is determined by individual, context and product-related factors. Environmental concern and awareness and communication about environmental benefits and food waste avoidance can improve acceptance and choice. There is a need for a wider variety of methods, theories and research contexts in studying the phenomenon. Stakeholders and researchers should take a broader perspective on the topic in order to accelerate the uptake of circularity in the interrelation of food and other industry domains. © 2021","Acceptance; Bio-economy; Circular economy; Consumer behaviour; Upcycling; Waste-to-value","Consumer behavior; Sustainable development; Acceptance; Agri-food system; Agricultural productions; Bio-economy; Circular economy; Food production; Product streams; Side streams; Upcycling; Waste-to-value; Food products; agricultural production; communication; consumption behavior; food production; food waste; innovation; literature review; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102849610

The operations and supply chain management literature remains surprisingly disconnected from these debates. This essay sets out to further our theoretical knowledge of what resilience means (or means to others) by disentangling two prominent perspectives of resilience—engineering resilience and social-ecological resilience—and offering an updated definition of supply chain resilience. We integrate and discuss these perspectives in the context of our understanding of the supply chain as a system. The goal is to outline the potential links and inconsistencies of these perspectives with supply chain management (SCM). From there, we seek to develop a more comprehensive understanding of what resilience means in SCM. Supply chain resilience is then no longer understood in terms of stability, but in terms of adaptation and transformation. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","Adaptation; Social-ecological systems; Supply chain resilience; Transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101904689

To test our hypotheses we conducted a content analysis of statements made in eight European news outlets on a sample of 13 policy issues and combined this with Eurobarometer polls.

Conversely, research on learning and social control has considered opacity-understood as a lack of transparency-to be conducive to substantive CSR adoption. These opposing viewpoints highlight a fundamental tension: Is transparency good or bad for substantive adoption? This paper resolves this tension by asking an alternative question: When is transparency good or bad, and why? We advance a dynamic perspective that conceives transparency and opacity as transitory phenomena, and we specify the boundary conditions for which either enduring or transitory forms of transparency and opacity further the substantive adoption of CSR. Our analyses reveal that, for circumstances under which the motivation of ceremonial adoption is hypocritical (rather than opportunistic) and where both substantive adoption and practice abandonment are difficult, the former can be maximized by first allowing organizations to adopt a CSR practice ceremonially under opacity (""bait""), and then prompting ceremonial adopters to become substantive adopters through a shift to transparency (""switch""). Specifying this bait-and-switch mechanism and its underlying contingencies reveals a hitherto unexplored, and potentially effective, pathway toward the institutionalization of CSR. © 2021 Academy of Management.

This article opens up the black box of the agencies and zooms in on their CEO's and their perceptions of hierarchical accountability. The article focuses on felt accountability, denoting the manager's (a) expectation to have to explain substantive decisions to a parent department perceived to be (b) legitimate and (c) to have the expertise to evaluate those decisions. We explore felt accountability of agency-CEO's and its institutional antecedents with a survey in seven countries combining insights from public administration and psychology. Our bottom-up perspective reveals close connections between de facto control practices rather than formal institutional characteristics and felt accountability of CEO's of agencies.

We find that many researchers use LTDVs for the wrong reasons, and very often in a way that is misaligned with the hypothesis they intend to examine. Researchers also appear unaware of the severe shortcomings of LTDVs. Using LTDVs implies estimating an exponential model, which represents a non-linear relationship. We identify three myths that are widely followed by researchers: (1) LTDVs should be used to make distributions more normal; (2) linear hypotheses can be tested with LTDVs; and (3) LTDVs are the best way to estimate an exponential model. We call on researchers to exhibit caution when planning to use LTDVs and recommend instead the use of generalized linear models (GLMs) with quasi-maximum likelihood estimation. The superiority of GLMs is demonstrated by two empirical examples from recently published studies. © 2020 British Academy of Management and Wiley Periodicals LLC",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090138603

While industry-support policies stimulate the growth of their target sectors, little is known about how such policies engender heterogeneous international strategies. In this article, we investigate how industry-support policies influence foreign location choices. We argue that firms engage in jurisdiction shopping, choosing to invest in countries with more generous policy support, but that this tendency varies markedly across firms. Specifically, we suggest that firms’ nonmarket experience exacerbates the effect of policy support on location choice, whereas market experience has less of an impact. Further, we propose that some firms view generous policies more skeptically than others, depending on the nature of their nonmarket experience. We test and find support for our predictions using a longitudinal dataset of foreign investments of firms entering the solar energy industry in the European Union. Our findings indicate that supportive policies stimulate the energy transition, attracting in particular foreign entrants diversifying into renewables or having more policy experience. At the same time, they suggest that adverse policy changes in one country affect how firms assess policies in other countries, highlighting the need for policy coordination at a supranational level. © 2020, The Author(s).","energy; industrial policy; institutional theory; jurisdiction shopping; location strategy; nonmarket strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089987099

I test the model predictions on a sample of 113 countries, using the relative price of consumption and investment goods as a measure of allocation efficiency.

Analyzing historical field (study 1) and experimental data (study 2), the author demonstrates that male-skewed sex ratios increase men’s sex tourism rationalization and intent, while women’s predispositions are not sensitive to sex ratios. Sex tourism is explained as a subconscious ecological plasticity in response to perceived increased intensities of same-sex competition for mates, signaled by male-skewed sex ratios. The findings demonstrate a link between mating ecologies and sex tourism, with the latter serving as a compensatory behavior of same-sex mating competition.

We outline these digital transformations, offer a focus on corporate political activity as informational and develop a typology of datafied corporate political activity techniques to illustrate how the workings of digital spaces shape political issues more concretely. This serves to highlight the necessity of extending the focus of informational corporate political activity beyond the contents of overt and direct messages to include the more covert and subtle forms of influence made possible through the strategic structuring of information itself. This also contributes to our understanding of the political significance of corporate political activity, which is less about influencing political issues by composing appealing messages and distributing them to relevant audiences, and more about influencing political issues by organizing digital information and feeding algorithms. We suggest that such datastructures and algorithmic forms of sorting will become as important as message contents, and that datafied advocacy will become a central component of corporate political activity and other organizational activities. © The Author(s) 2020.","Advocacy; algorithms; corporate political activity; digital transformations; strategic communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086589655

As leaders envision the future, guide choices, tame apprehension, regulate expectations, experiment nimbly, and collaborate frequently, they will be able to channel the pressures of change to create positive outcomes for their teams and organizations. More importantly, organizations that create routines and processes that encourage, develop, and enable these behaviors internally will lead in a world where customer needs, employee demands, and shareholder expectations are continuously evolving. © 2018, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139810495

The condition can lead to health problems and social isolation because exercise is given the highest priority in any situation. The prevalence of the risk of exercise addiction has mostly been assessed in leisure time exercisers such as runners, fitness attendees and cyclists. The prevalence proportion ranges from 3 to 42% depending on the type of sport and the assessment tool. The proportion is greater among elite athletes, and increases with the level of competition. This study's primary aim was to assess the prevalence of exercise addiction among elite athletes competing at national level and its secondary aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Exercise Addition Inventory (EAI) in elite sports. Participants (n = 417) from 15 sports disciplines and with 51% women completed an online survey. Results showed that 7.6% were at risk of exercise addiction. This group was younger, exhibited tendency to exercise despite pain and injury, felt guilty if not exercising enough, and reported substantial eating disorder symptoms. The reliability and validity of the EAI was good suggesting that the scale is appropriate for measuring the risk of exercise addiction in elite athletes.

A significant amount of neural networks research has been reported to develop prognostics models that can provide high prediction accuracy. These models use advanced neural networks to improve prediction performance and provide sole point estimation for RUL. However, accurate uncertainty quantification of the RUL is essential to understand the uncertainty of the degradation process and perform reliable risk analysis and maintenance decisions. This paper proposes a new hybrid Bayesian deep learning (HBDL)-based prognostics approach. It uses long short term memory autoencoder (LSTM-AE) to extract features that include degradation information, and then uses the Bayesian neural network (BNN) to model and predict the equipment degeneration process. It learns network weights through variational inference (VI) and provides RUL prognostics results while obtaining interval estimation. Finally, a general aircraft engine data set is used to verify the proposed model. The experimental results show that this method can achieve satisfying prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification capability. © 2021 IEEE.","Aircraft engine; CI; HBDL; LSTM-AE; RUL prognostics; Uncertainty quantification","Aircraft engines; Decision making; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning systems; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian neural networks; Maintenance decision making; Maintenance decisions; Prediction performance; Reliability assessments; Remaining useful lives; Uncertainty quantifications; Variational inference; Long short-term memory",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114555372

Under steady and transient operating conditions, the power electronic circuits are simulated to deduce the law of output voltage and inductance current variation of the boost and buck converter, and the operation state of the physical entity is estimated. Degradation characteristic parameters, such as capacitance, inductance, parasitic resistance, and MOSFET on-state resistance, are selected and identified based on the Bayesian optimization.

We test our theory in the context of academic scientists where collaborations within and across organizations are common channels to access complementary assets. We find that cross-organizational collaborations are positively related to an individual's decision to move to a previous coauthor's organization. Additionally, moving to an organization where an individual had a direct collaboration is positively related to postmobility performance. This suggests that prior collaboration facilitates better employer-employee matches. We unpack this finding and show that the postmobility performance increase is not only driven by increased productivity with prior coauthors, it is also driven by novel collaborations with new colleagues.

The purpose of this article is to explore how social innovation in Danish public services is conceptualised and enacted through the lenses of public service innovation networks for social innovation. To do this, a thorough integrative review of the literature dealing with the Danish context is conducted. The Danish context is interesting in order to investigate these network arrangements, firstly because they are not well understood in the context of the Nordic welfare states, which Denmark is part of, and then because municipalities and civil society have historically had a mutually dependent relationship in Denmark. The article highlights that social innovation is framed in several ways in the Danish public sector. In particular, the results show that the literature can be grouped according to four themes: (1) samskabelse (co-creation), (2) collaboration with civil society, (3) social entrepreneurs and social innovation and (4) public–private innovation partnerships. Moreover, the article presents and discusses a number of Danish empirical projects that may be understood through the lens of the PSINSI framework. Hence, the paper contributes with new theoretical perspectives, in addition to contributing to practice. © 2021 by the authors.

A strong relationship enables the underwriter to credibly certify the issuer resulting in lower direct issuance costs and lower underpricing. However, if the underwriter becomes distressed, this spills over to the issuer's credit risk, because it weakens the relationship and increases the risk of involuntary relationship termination. The credit risk spillover is more pronounced for risky, information-sensitive issuers with high rollover exposure, i.e., those issuers most in need of certification by an underwriter. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Corporate bonds; Relationship banking; Rollover risk; Underwriter relationship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104675637

As commodity transit times are often a critical factor, the literature has introduced hard limits on commodity transit times. In practical contexts, however, these hard limits may fail to provide sufficient flexibility since routes with even tiny delays would be discarded. Motivated by a major liner shipping operator, we study an MCNF generalization where transit time restrictions are modeled as soft constraints, in which delays are discouraged using penalty functions of transit time. Similarly, early commodity arrivals can receive a discount in cost. We derive properties that distinguish this model from other MCNF variants and adapt a column generation procedure to efficiently solve it. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on realistic liner shipping instances reveal that the explicit consideration of penalty functions can lead to significant cost reductions compared to hard transit time deadlines. Moreover, the penalties can be used to steer the flow towards slower or faster configurations, resulting in a potential increase in operational costs, which generates a trade-off that we quantify under varying penalty functions. © 2021 The Authors","Column generation; Liner shipping; Multi-commodity flow; Networks; Transit time","algorithm; network analysis; optimization; shipping; travel time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104608394

Oviatt’s and McDougall’s (J Int Bus Stud 25:45–64, 1994) framework describing international new ventures (INVs) has been pivotal in developing this research field. This paper adds to this research field through focusing on a particular type of INVs that typically regard social impact as the core objective rather than a positive side-effect to profit. We collectively label these firms international social ventures (ISV). The paper provides two interrelated contributions. Firstly, a literature review brings a systematic overview of the extant ISV research. Secondly, building on this, five propositions are developed in close relation to each of the essential elements positioned in Oviatt’s and McDougall’s (J Int Bus Stud 25:45–64, 1994) seminal INV framework. In doing so, we illustrate that ISVs share some general characteristics with INVs. However, the particular manifestation of these deviates from the traditional type of INVs. In addition, the underlying rationale differs from traditional pure economic logics by involving a combination of both social and economic logics.

To facilitate cross-cultural research, we validated an instrument measuring four employee silence motives (i.e., silence based on fear, resignation, prosocial, and selfish motives) in 21 languages. Across 33 countries (N = 8,222) representing diverse cultural clusters, the instrument shows good psychometric properties (i.e., internal reliabilities, factor structure, and measurement invariance). Results further revealed similarities and differences in the prevalence of silence motives between countries, but did not necessarily support cultural stereotypes. To explore the role of culture for silence, we examined relationships of silence motives with the societal practices cultural dimensions from the GLOBE Program. We found relationships between silence motives and power distance, institutional collectivism, and uncertainty avoidance. Overall, the findings suggest that relationships between silence and cultural dimensions are more complex than commonly assumed. We discuss the explanatory power of nations as (cultural) units of analysis, our social scientific approach, the predictive value of cultural dimensions, and opportunities to extend silence research geographically, methodologically, and conceptually. © 2021 The Authors.

Denmark has the highest debt-to-income ratio of all OECD countries, yet the high level of consumer debt has received relatively little political attention in Denmark and the social and legal protection of citizens with debt problems is limited. This article presents findings from an empirical study that investigated the distribution of consumer loans in Denmark. Drawing on the notion of “risk position,” the article challenges the idea that only socially marginal groups are at risk of getting into debt problems. The empirical study analysed the sociodemographic distribution of two common types of loan in Denmark (bank loans and credit card debt) based on the administrative register data of a full population of individuals. Register-based data provide much more reliable measures of debt than self-reported surveys, because of non-response problems in surveys. The results show not only high debt levels among hitherto known vulnerable social groups, but also highlight groups of middle- and higher-income wage earners with very high levels of debt. We frame the results in the light of existing policy measures in Denmark and suggest the need for a better balance between deregulation of credit markets and individualization of debt problems on the one hand and the need for political protection of individual loan takers on the other. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Administrative data; Consumer credit; Debt risk; Denmark",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104228455

Inspired by the Slow Food Movement, this paper develops a more wholesome alternative. Slow Management is about doing less, but better management that is more thoughtful and less flashy.

While current research mainly focuses on crises as a challenge for entrepreneurial ventures and potential regulatory response mechanisms, we complement this research by addressing the question of how crises in general—and COVID-19's physical distancing measures in particular—shape entrepreneurial opportunities for social innovation. Based on two rounds of data collection—desktop research mapping out 95 entrepreneurial activities in Germany and four focus groups—we find first that entrepreneurs are proactive agents in alleviating the negative consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. They do so by creating two types of digital social innovation: digital brokering and digitized services. Second, we note that negative societal consequences of crises can be buffered by shifts in entrepreneurs’ strategic orientation through improvised venturing, rapid pivoting and pro-social product extension. Third, we note variance in the persistence of changes with consequences for entrepreneurial opportunities and social innovation: Whereas some social innovation are rather ephemeral, others might endure and promise long-term impacts. We offer key insights for the literature on crisis, social innovation and hybrid organizing as well as on the implications for entrepreneurship practice and policy. © 2020","COVID-19; Crisis; Digitalization; Entrepreneurial opportunities; Social innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103603457

We argue that recommender systems, as a component of the Offer Management System, hold the key to providing customer centricity with their ability to understand and respond to the needs of the customers through all touchpoints during the traveler journey. We present six recommender system use cases that cover the entire traveler journey and we discuss the particular mind-set and needs of the customer for each of these use cases. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence have enabled the development of a new generation of recommender systems to provide more accurate, contextualized and personalized offers to customers. This paper contains a systematic review of the different families of recommender system algorithms and discusses how the use cases can be implemented in practice by matching them with a recommender system algorithm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Dynamic offer construction; NDC; Recommender systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103158887

While prior work has recognized that dispersed teams face coordination challenges, it is not clear how dispersion affects team process efficiency outcomes, such as the speed with which team efforts come to a resolution. Process efficiency outcomes are important because, if the performance benefits associated with working in dispersed teams have a trade-off cost in terms of efficiency, then the net performance benefits from working in such teams may be seriously diminished or even reversed. Prior work has also tended to focus on successful outcomes, which may lead to deficits in our understanding of coordination challenges in dispersed teams. To better comprehend process efficiency, we examine 5,250 teams that work together in an open standard setting, and where the time to resolution of both successful and failed projects is observable. We find that teams that are organizationally or geographically dispersed are fast at reaching success, but fail more slowly than non-dispersed teams. Our interpretation of these disparate outcomes is that the endogenous processes that make dispersed teams more likely to on average select higher potential projects have a second order effect of making it harder for dispersed teams to abandon failing projects. We argue that slow failure has important implications for research & development efforts given the opportunity cost of tying up resources in research teams. © 2021","Collaboration; Coordination; Dispersed teams; Open source communities; Process efficiency; Research teams","Beams and girders; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Dispersed teams; Endogenous process; Opportunity costs; Organizational boundaries; Performance benefits; Process efficiency; Research teams; Second order effect; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102619757

More precisely, we examine how formally prescribed R&D unit task collaboration and the distinct roles of R&D units as recipients and sources in such collaboration affect how intensively unit members search for advice and knowledge. To this end, we integrate theoretical mechanisms from knowledge search and organizational design literatures into models explaining the emergence of work-related advice networks among employees in corporate R&D. Empirically, we capture the influence of unit-level task collaboration on individual-level search by applying exponential random graph modelling to multilevel network data collected on 193 employees belonging to 38 R&D units in a leading German high-tech firm. Results show that the extent to which R&D units function as recipients in unit task collaboration on the one hand and as sources on the other influences unit members’ search intensity in opposite ways. Members of units functioning as recipients for many other units search less intensively, i.e., there is a substitution effect. Conversely, if R&D units are sources for many other units, their members search more intensively. The latter complementarity effect is weaker for R&D units that are specialized on a particular product component. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Component specialization; Corporate R&D; Individual search; Network; Organizational design; R&D unit task collaboration","Personnel; Advice networks; High-tech firms; Individual levels; Multi-level networks; Organizational designs; Search behavior; Search intensity; Substitution effect; Graph theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102251916

We discuss the implications of these findings for theory development and provide directions for future research. © 2021","Common effects; Commonality analysis; Cultural intelligence; Incremental predictive validity; Joint effects; Meta-analysis; Unique effects; Work-related outcomes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101754194

Being a niche research field before, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created a strong urgency to develop this topic. For researching pandemic-induced changes in tourist beliefs and travel behaviour, we developed a construct that measures the intra-personal anxiety of travellers (and non-travellers): the Pandemic (COVID-19) Anxiety Travel Scale (PATS), using two large online studies (N = 2180; N = 2062) and including two different cultural contexts (US and Denmark). In Study 1, explorative and confirmative factors analysis confirms a short and easy-to-use 5-item solution, while the presented model adds face validity. Study 2 confirmed the structure (reliability) and tested nomological validity, by putting PATS into the context of different constructs (xenophobia and prevention focus).

In this context, we study the international impact of innovations from specific countries. Based on panel data of patents from 27 countries over 17 years, we find that levels of open innovation, technological complexity, and dominant design influence the international impact of innovations from a country. Contrary to earlier research, however, this influence is negative when open innovation activities are involved. This is particularly relevant in the context of Chinese innovation, in which the same innovation networks that promote efficient production may hinder the development of innovations. Due to the innate uncertainty and newness of innovation, partners beyond the common local and long-term networks must be included. Hence, to effectively create a New Silk Road of Innovation, innovation ecosystems may need to expand across national borders.

Constrained by brains and bodies (the micro domain) that attune to structural constraints (the macro domain), human beings use material culture – artefacts, language, practices, etc. – to animate what we call social organising in the meso domain. The resulting coordination can anticipate organisational goals such that, as demonstrated in the case of peer-review, social organising regulates epistemic practice. Flexible, embodied activity enables reviewers and to meet the aims of organised science by pooling the expertise of those involved.

The theoretical literature typically explains the bystander effect with the volunteer's dilemma: if providing help is equivalent to creating a public good, then bystanders could be less likely to help in groups because they free ride on the other bystanders. This paper uses a dynamic game to experimentally test such strategic interactions as an explanation for the bystander effect. In line with the predictions of the volunteer's dilemma, I find that bystanders help immediately when they are alone but help later and are less likely to help if they are part of a larger group. In contrast to the model's predictions, subjects in need of help are helped earlier and are more likely to be helped in larger groups. This finding can be accounted for in an extended model that includes both altruistic and selfish bystanders. The paper concludes that the volunteer's dilemma is a sensible way to model situations in which someone is in need of help, but it highlights the need to take heterogeneous social preferences into account. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Altruism; Bystander effect; Group size; Helping behavior; Volunteer's dilemma",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097389067

By drawing on an ethnographic examination of a quintessential cosmopolitan servicescape, Red Rooster Harlem, and applying an analytical lens grounded in the cultural understanding of retail spaces, we conceptualize the cosmopolitan servicescape in relation to other themed environments. Cosmopolitan servicescapes provide consumers a playground for encounters with cultural difference through enlisting cultural resources that shift out in time, place, and identity, thus enabling the performance of cosmopolitan competence. In addition, cosmopolitan servicescapes juxtapose cultural resources to create incongruent meanings, promote heteroglossia, and appeal to different levels of cosmopolitan competence. Finally, cosmopolitan servicescapes use decoding cues to facilitate cosmopolitan engagement and recognition cues to frame the environment as cosmopolitan.

We draw on signaling theory to propose that diaspora ownership – diaspora members’ equity investments in their homeland firms – constitutes a reliable third-party signal of emerging market firms’ trustworthiness, which facilitates the access of these firms to international technology licensing. We further hypothesize that the efficacy of diaspora ownership as a third-party signal varies with the firm’s subnational context. Specifically, the relevance of diaspora ownership signal increases with the degree of homogeneity of the within-industry R&D effort in the firm’s sub-national location. This is because, under these conditions, additional signals are required to differentiate between local firms operating in the same industry. In contrast, the diaspora ownership signal has a smaller effect in dysfunctional institutional contexts due to their prohibitive transaction costs. We test our arguments on a matched sample of 597 Indian firms operating between 2006 and 2015, and find general support for the predicted relationships.

Today, human chat service agents are frequently replaced by conversational software agents or chatbots, which are systems designed to communicate with human users by means of natural language often based on artificial intelligence (AI). Though cost- and time-saving opportunities triggered a widespread implementation of AI-based chatbots, they still frequently fail to meet customer expectations, potentially resulting in users being less inclined to comply with requests made by the chatbot. Drawing on social response and commitment-consistency theory, we empirically examine through a randomized online experiment how verbal anthropomorphic design cues and the foot-in-the-door technique affect user request compliance.

To advance theories on organizational adaptation and performance heterogeneity, it is essential to understand different reasons for different organizational responses. We examine how incumbents in carbon-intensive industries adapt to heightened environmental pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Based on a review of the literature, we propose three dimensions along which diverse organizational responses can be efficiently mapped out: goal, timing, and scope. Building on our proposed dimensions, we develop a typology of five different organizational responses. With this, we show that organizational responses are more diverse than a one-dimensional scale could show but that the heterogeneity is somehow limited as the positions on the dimensions are not independent but correlated. To understand this observed limited heterogeneity, we proceed by identifying reasons behind different organizational responses. Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical implications of our findings for research on organizational adaptation and sustainability. © The Author(s) 2020.","carbon-intensive industry; climate change; organizational adaptation; organizational heterogeneity; sustainability","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; heterogeneity; sustainability; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078906157

However, little is known about the particular KM capabilities that lead to business model innovation (BMI) and whether their effect is dependent upon the firm's orientation towards risk-taking. We examine the impact internal and external KM capabilities have on BMI and how these effects are moderated by its risk-taking tolerance. We empirically analyze a sample of 197 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) applying structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results from the SEM indicate that particularly external KM capabilities stimulate BMI. This relationship is strengthened for firms with a high risk-taking tolerance. Internal knowledge is only effective for firms with a low risk-taking tolerance. The fsQCA results substantiate these findings and refine the SEM by providing particular antecedent conditions for high levels of BMI. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Business model innovation; Knowledge management capabilities; PLS path modeling; Risk-taking tolerance; SMEs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077922417

In this case-based qualitative study, the authors explicate how specific individual and collective practices contribute continuously to alleviating hybridity-related tensions among for-profit hybrids and allow them to achieve success. With a micro-foundational perspective on for-profit hybrids’ dynamic capabilities, this study’s findings identify four central, dynamic capabilities of for-profit hybrids, supported by respective sets of micro-foundations. Nine of these micro-foundations contribute specifically to addressing central tensions, to different extents.

We use Bourdieu’s theoretical ideas combined with a focus on narratives as an original and fertile perspective for studying OI. We propose that OI is inherently temporal, embodied and socially configured and cannot be separated from the institutionalized context of its setting because it is interlaced with (in this case) health professional logics. We show how OI is constructed through the strategizing moves of managers and nurses.

This question is inherently difficult to answer and in this single-company multiple case study, we test narrative facilitation of strategy workshops that aimed at implementing strategy and propose a method for measuring its effectiveness. We used a Mann–Whitney U-test to statistically compare the effectiveness of facilitating workshops with and without interview technique from narrative therapy. The study shows that an empirical comparison of the effectiveness of narrative facilitation technique can be made statistically through a Mann–Whitney U-test when part of the workshop data, e.g. employees’ self-evaluation of possible actions’ impact on strategy, can be numerically evaluated. We assessed effectiveness according to the participants’ evaluation of planned future actions’ relative impact on strategy on a 10-point scale where 10 was maximum impact on strategy. The result showed that using narrative facilitation technique (median: 8.5) was more effective compared to not using it (median: 7) and that the difference was significant (p = 0.0216). The study also gives valuable insight in how an effective facilitation technique can be empirically condensed through expert reviews and sorting and naming exercises resulting in a prescriptive guide to effective facilitation of strategy implementation workshops and thus adds empirical detail to the ongoing discussion of measurement methods in action research design. © The Author(s) 2018.","effectiveness; facilitation; research design; Strategy; workshop",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049828846

Many are industrializing rapidly and the largest, particularly China and India, could have an impact at least as significant as that of the already industrialized economies - the reason given by President Bush for taking the US out of the Kyoto Protocol. The future of sustainable development in large measure depends on developing countries. This book develops a pragmatic framework for evaluating the climate change options faced by each developing country, depending on their individual circumstances. It assesses present methods, suggests how these might be improved, and proposes ways in which social and developmental aspects can be taken into account. Its discussion of the issues and the methods presented contribute to the practical analysis of climate change mitigation options in developing countries.

Power and Influence of Economists explores the interconnected relationship between power, knowledge and influence which has led economics to be both a source and beneficiary of widespread power and influence. The contributors to this book explore the complex and diverse methods and channels that economists have used to exert and expand their influence from different disciplinary and national perspectives. Four different analytical views on the role of power and economics are taken: first, the role of economic expert discourses as power devices for the formation of influential expertise; second, the logics and modalities of governmentality that produce power/knowledge apparatuses between science and society; third, economists as involved in networks between academia, politics and the media; and forth, economics considered as a social field, including questions of legitimacy and unequal relations between economists based on the detention of various capitals. The volume includes case studies on a variety of national configurations of economics, such as the US, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Greece, Mexico and Brazil, as well as international spaces and organisations such as the IMF. This book provides innovative research perspectives for students and scholars of heterodox economics, cultural political economy, sociology of professions, network studies, and the social studies of power, discourse and knowledge.

This paper aims to systematically review the knowledge emerging from the literature at the intersection between Circular Economy and the EEE supply chain, with a special focus on enablers, levers, and their potential environmental, economic and social benefits. An original framework is developed to categorise Circular Economy enablers, levers and potential benefits. Companies in the EEE industry aiming to implement Circular Economy can exploit several enablers (grouped into digitalization, government intervention, and users’ active role) and levers (grouped into circular product design, servitised business models, and supply chain management) to generate economic, environmental and social benefits. Based on the framework, 115 articles were scrutinised. The analysis led to the definition of a research agenda, with policy and industry implications. To advance Circular Economy research in the EEE supply chain, future studies should address: (i) the enabling role of digitalization, particularly within blockchain, 3D Printing, augmented and virtual reality; (ii) design strategies focused on ‘reduce’; (iii) servitised business models based on result-oriented offerings; (iv) collaboration in the EEE supply chain; (v) the assessment of social and economic benefits to users.

The hotel sector features high energy consumption, which greatly contributes to the global warming effect. Thus, there is a need to investigate environmentally friendly technologies that have the potential to reduce energy usage within this sector. Information regarding the current status of the energy consumption in hotels is essential. Therefore, a study of 140 hotels in Norway and Sweden is presented in this paper to identify successful and sustainable measures to reduce energy consumption and related emissions. The energy use, available energy sources and thermal systems in the hotels are studied over a five-year period to identify consumption trends. The results reveal that 70% of the hotels have a mean annual energy consumption between 150 and 250 kWh/m2. A shift towards sustainable energy sources is observed in the hotels from 2015 to 2019, where application and overall consumption of district heating and cooling have increased, while electrical energy consumption has been reduced. District heating is the most prominent source of heating and is applied as the primary heat source in 70% of the hotels. The specific energy consumption for the group hotels that apply district heating is 218.9 kWh/m2/year, which is nearly 25% higher than the specific energy consumption of the 9% of hotels that apply heat pump solutions as a primary heat source. Thus, there is a potential to reduce the specific energy consumption in hotels. Two integrated transcritical carbon dioxide (CO2) heat pumps were investigated as a sustainable measure to reduce energy consumption. The results reveal that a reduction of thermal energy consumption of approximately 60% can be achieved. © 2021 The Author(s)","Cold climates; Energy use; Hotels; Thermal energy systems","Carbon dioxide; District heating; Energy utilization; Global warming; Heat pump systems; Hotels; Pumps; Colder climate; Energy consumption in hotels; Energy use; European economy; Heat pumps; Heat sources; Hotel sectors; Reduce energy consumption; Specific energy consumption; Thermal energy systems; Thermal energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103549505

COVID-19 vaccine has been considered by many specialists as the best strategy to face the pandemic. Developing a safe and effective vaccine to combat COVID-19 in a timely manner is as daunting as scaling-up manufacturing to produce billions of doses. To accomplish such a goal, pharmaceutical companies have to prepare themselves in terms of infrastructure to ramp-up production as quickly as possible. One potential alternative to do that is to build a network of manufacturing partners. We consider the question of how to speed up technology transfer to ramp-up production under time pressure. We explore the main factors that enact the execution of technology transfer, with particular focus on the managerial and strategic dimensions to support a swift vaccine technology transfer. We conduct an in-depth case study between a multinational pharmaceutical industry and a research and production institute, located in an emerging country. In spite of the present paper still being an ongoing research, we believe our results already shed light on how to prepare for the effective fight against pandemics that may arise in the future. © 2021 IEEE.","COVID-19 vaccine; Technology Transfer; Time pressure","Manufacture; Technology transfer; Emerging countries; Pharmaceutical company; Pharmaceutical industry; Ramp up; Scaling-up; Speed up; Time pressures; Vaccine technologies; Vaccines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112225192

It considers the case of the VELUX Group with the release of their smart home device VELUX Active and the development of business ecosystems from the remote-control wireless devices of 2005 to the smart home groupings of 2020 to better understand why there is not more widespread implementation of business models designed for sustainability. The research finds that although a green order of worth, representing sustainability value, may be frequently argued, that market and industrial orders of worth have demonstrated greater maturity in arguments and value reframing that determine the basis of smart home collaborations. Further, it supports a growing body of research suggesting that business model innovation processes are experimental and gradual, and that iterative structural prototypes and piloting of sustainability activities can potentially bridge the design-implementation gap. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Activity networks; Business model innovation; Business models for sustainability; Design-implementation gap; Orders of worth; Value alignment","Automation; Bridges; Industrial research; Intelligent buildings; Remote control; Activity network; Business model for sustainability; Business model innovation; Business models; Business partnership; Design implementation; Design-implementation gap; Order of worth; Smart homes; Value alignment; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102787803

Simulations were performed by integrating the production of biomethane, electricity, thermal energy, and fertilizer for five revenue conditions. BSG generation from different brewery industrial scales was considered. Results showed that investing one million USD for a treatment capacity of 137 t BSG d−1 makes it possible to recover up to 350,000 USD y−1 when selling electric energy to the grid, using the thermal energy for the facility self-consumption, and selling the fertilizer for agriculture application. The economic analysis for this scale resulted in a payback time of 3.76 y, ROI of 23.68%, and NPV up to 1.5 million USD. The revenue considering biomethane and fertilizer was profitable and amenable for a real application, with a payback time of 3.67 y and IRR up to 20%. From the sensitivity analysis, the selling price of fertilizer, biomethane, electricity, and heat were the most important variables affecting the project's economic viability. Beyond, project implementation from equity could upgrade the feasibility. Ultimately, the waste management system with bioenergy recovery and fertilizer production from the AD of BSG is profitable and could be suitable for an oncoming implementation in breweries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Brewer's spent grain; Electrical energy; Fertilizer; Methane; Techno-economic assessment","Anaerobic digestion; Brewing; Economic analysis; Fertilizers; Grain (agricultural product); Profitability; Refining; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal energy; Anaerobics; Bioenergy productions; Biomethane; Biorefineries; Brewers spent grains; Electrical energy; Energy; Fertilizer production; Techno-economic assessment; Thermal; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102627708

Three MSW based waste-to-energy (WtE) scenarios is developed: (i) Scenario-I, a DH system integrated into a gas turbine power plant (GTPP), (ii) Scenario-II, a DH system integrated into an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), and (iii) Scenario-III, which is based solely on a DH system. As a result of the thermodynamic and thermoeconomic analyzes of these developed scenarios using an existing MSW-based cogeneration facility's actual operating data, the system with the most extended payback period (about 5 years) is found as the GTPP-DH system developed in Scenario-I, which also has the highest investment cost. On the other hand, the system with the shortest payback period (about 2 years) is found as the DH system developed in Scenario-III, which also has the lowest investment cost.

Palm oil mill effluents were aerobically fermented to produce lipids and subsequently the effluent from the fermentation was used as influent feedstock in an anaerobic digester for biogas production. It was found that pasteurization of the wastewater before fermentation by Yarrowia lipolytica TISTR 5151 was mandatory for efficient lipid production yielding 159.2 mg lipids/g-COD. In contrast, fermentation with untreated wastewater failed to produce lipids (3.10–43.51 mg lipids/g-COD), but instead supported the growth of several indigenous bacteria (e.g., Asaia sp., Lactobacillus brevis and Acetobacter sp.) with 6.57%–65.24% of relative abundance. Regarding biogas production, a maximum of 74% of the theoretical methane yield (280 mL/g-COD) in continuous reactor operation was achieved. The dominant bacteria, Synergistales sp. (18.19%) and Bacteroidetes sp. (15.96%), found at steady state period in the biogas reactor are known for acetate, butyrate, and hydrogen production. Moreover, within archaeal population, Methanosarcina thermophila (2.27%) and Methanoculleus thermophilus (1.38%) were identified as responsible for biomethane production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Biorefinery concept; Lipid; Microbial community","Bacteria; Biogas; Effluents; Fermentation; Hydrogen production; Palm oil; Refining; Volatile fatty acids; Biogas production; Biorefineries; Biorefinery concept; Integrated biorefinery; Integrated production; Microbial communities; Microbial oil; Palm oil mill effluents; Palm oil mills; Valorisation; Lipids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102141328

The design of entrepreneurship policies has been debated extensively. In formulating policies, one of the major questions that emerges is whether policies should promote the entry of more entrepreneurs into the market, and if yes, which type of entry should be promoted, and how can it be implemented? On the one hand, excess entry can lead to a significant waste of resources because the majority of new entrepreneurs fail within a short period, and very few achieve the societal goal of high growth and job creation. On the other hand, focusing on promoting only attractive entrepreneurs, from society’s point of view, might be an impossible exercise. Recently a different rationale for entrepreneurship policy has been suggested, arguing that entrepreneurship is largely about experimentation, where ideas are carried from firm to firm by individuals, despite failures along the way. This chapter discusses these policy directions, reviews the recent literature and points to the future direction of entrepreneurship policy. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104801234

The supplier types vary in their engagement with their most important customers, but not in performance. The interaction-oriented nature of the Danish innovation system is also reflected in the identified supplier types, and there are no signs of global competition and production relocation undermining this distinctive feature of the Danish system.

The reforms follow in the wake of a year-long debate on the relevance of the regional level for policies, which also includes a debate on which actors are relevant at different levels of aggregation. The policy reform of 2019 appears to centralise how business support is provided and also to possibly decouple some of the already established systemic links between actors. Although the new business promotion policy setup in Denmark does acknowledge that the decentralised business promotion effort should take its point of departure in local and regional growth challenges and framework conditions, there is a clear move towards simplification in organisation and actors, as well as in policy means. The precise, adequate configuration of the innovation system and its support infrastructure is difficult to determine ex ante and surely needs to be seen in a specific systemic context. © Designs and Patents Act 1988.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104707622

We investigate whether spoken input from conversations can be used as a context to improve query auto-completion. We model the temporal dynamics of the spoken conversational context preceding queries and use these models to re-rank the query auto-completion suggestions. Data were collected from a controlled experiment and comprised conversations among 12 participant pairs conversing about movies or traveling. Search query logs during the conversations were recorded and temporally associated with the conversations. We compared the effects of spoken conversational input in four conditions: a control condition without contextualization; an experimental condition with the model using search query logs; an experimental condition with the model using spoken conversational input; and an experimental condition with the model using both search query logs and spoken conversational input. We show the advantage of combining the spoken conversational context with the Web-search context for improved retrieval performance.

Mobile work, coworking, flex office, platform-based entrepreneurship, virtual collaborations, Do It Yourself (DIT), remote work, digital nomads, among other trends, epitomize ways of organizing work practice that purportedly align productivity with freedom. But most ethnographical research already reveals many paradoxical experiences associated with these new practices and processes. Indeed, it appears that with autonomy comes surveillance and control, to a point where, as Foucault observed way back, subjectivity and subject become synonyms, and the current pandemic both strengthens and makes visible this situation. In this introduction to the special issue we make a foray into this situation, using four open and related themes developed in the five papers we selected: managerial control and technology; surveillance and platform capitalism; time and space; and new organizational forms and autonomy. Paradoxical movements are identified for each of them, before we conclude by reflecting on a grounding paradox which appears at the centre of this special issue and the themes it covers. © The Author(s) 2021.","control systems; new forms of organizing; new ways of working; organizational control; remote work; surveillance; surveillance capitalism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105926343

The intention is to create and expand green and sustainable supply chains (SSC) to meet environmental and economic standards and to boost one's position in competitive markets. This study examines the resilient sustainable reverse logistics network (RLN) process for end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) in Iran. We pursue both actual and uncertain situations that possess big data characteristics (3 V's) in information between facilities of the proposed reverse logistics (RL), and we consider recycling technology due to its societal impacts. Due to unpredictable environmental and social factors, the various proposed network facilities may not utilize their full capacity, so we also consider situations in which the network facility capacity is disrupted. Our primary objective is to minimize the total cost of the resilient sustainable RLN. For most parameters, finding the best solution through traditional methods is time-consuming and costly. Hence, to enhance decision-making power, the value of model parameters in each scenario is considered. A Cross-Entropy (CE) algorithm with basic scenario concepts is used in robust model optimization. The results demonstrate that changing the scenario situation significantly impacts optimal environmental and social costs. In particular, when the situation is “pessimistic,” environmental impact costs are at their highest levels. Hence, scenario-based modeling of the network is a good approach to implement under uncertainty conditions. On the other hand, results show that cost savings for organizations are achieved through optimal planning of the centers' capacity to save cost, increase services, and ensure effective government response to cost-effective and instrumental market competition. © 2021","Big data; Cross-entropy algorithm; ELVs; Resilient sustainable reverse logistics network; Robust optimization","algorithm; competitiveness; data management; network design; optimization; public transport; supply chain management; sustainability; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104937280

While open innovation is about sharing knowledge to improve innovation processes and performance, DLT is a distributed data ledger that is utilized to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure immutability, traceability, security, and transparency. In this paper, we investigate the barriers to open innovation currently faced by small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) that DLT can solve. To achieve this goal, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 11 experts in open innovation and DLTs from Spain, Germany, Australia, and India. The results of our exploratory study show that DLTs can help to solve several problems, including external barriers, such as problems with contracts, financing, lack of trust, raw materials, lack of information, domestic and international market limitations, IP rights, and governmental regulations as well as bureaucracy. Internal challenges include insufficient funding, organizational systems that are out of date, and lack of trust. When it comes to difficulties associated with the management of open innovation, external barriers are frequently caused by customers' demands, while internal barriers are frequently caused by organizational culture or human nature, which cannot be improved by DLTs. Finally, SMEs might face new obstacles when integrating DLTs, such as integration problems, complex transition phases, and high setup costs as well as problems with attracting and retaining qualified employees. © 2021","Blockchain; Distributed ledger technology (DLT); External barriers; Internal barriers; Open innovation; SME problems; SMEs","International trade; Governmental regulations; International markets; Organizational cultures; Organizational system; Semi structured interviews; Small and medium sized enterprise; Small and medium-sized companies; Underlying principles; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104380828

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Metal additive manufacturing is increasingly used as a complementary manufacturing technique in industrial settings and slowly moving from pure prototyping applications toward full production. In parallel, there is an emergence of Industry 4.0, where the applicability of concepts such as digital twins of manufacturing machines and components are being investigated. Compared to conventionally manufactured parts, typical quality metrics of metal additively manufactured components such as dimensions, roughness, porosity, and hardness are underperforming in an as-built state. As a mitigation strategy, the build chamber variables are often measured and logged by the metal additive manufacturing system to maintain a stable production environment. Thus, proper insight into the expected responses in part quality from changes in those build chamber variables is important in the pursuit of digital twins and process improvement. This sheds more light on the influence of the gas flow variables, namely gas flow speed, relative pressure, and oxygen content on the metal additive manufacturing quality metrics, specifically channel roughness, bulk porosity, average diameter, the equivalent diameter of the unobstructed cross-sectional area, and hardness of the bulk. A Design of Experiments was implemented on two laser powder bed fusion systems, namely an SLM 280 processing 316L stainless steel and an SLM 500 processing Ti6Al4V. The current work found that surface oxidation of 316L and Ti6Al4V components may be classified based on simple red, green, and blue (RGB) color constituent analysis. The influence of gas flow variables was found to be different in the two investigated SLM systems, suggesting a high dependency on the processed material. Oxygen content in the build chamber had the highest standalone effect on the selected quality metrics, while the gas flow speed had the lowest standalone effect. The second-order effects were found to be, in general, more significant than the main effects. The findings of the current work is a step towards an improved understanding of the interaction effects of gas flow conditions on typical quality metrics of metal additive manufactured components. By the creation of simple but computationally fast response surface models, in-line assessments may be carried out and the effect of process variability on component quality may be evaluated in-situ while being one step away from the full feedback control implementation in the digital twin.

Findings reported in this work are based on analyzing Concept Structuring Analysis Task (ConSAT) interviews in which participants created their own concept maps, and participant observation of a two-year-long SSE process. This paper identifies three organizational mechanisms that facilitated a sustainable improvement-oriented SSE: the role of the evaluator, pooling resources through network structure, and the way the network uses evaluation data.

It unlocks the link between relationship duration and product de-listing by examining the role of MO and brand diffusion. Using a combination of primary data with both objective and perceptual measures and proprietary objective data from a sample of suppliers to a large British supermarket, we find that the supplier's brand diffusion is an essential means of utilizing relationship duration between suppliers and retailers to reduce product de-listing in retail stores. Additionally, we find that MO plays opposite moderating roles in the links between relationship duration, brand diffusion, and product de-listing. It strengthens the negative influence of relationship duration on product de-listing, while it weakens the positive influence of relationship duration on brand diffusion.

After controlling for individual and regional characteristics, we find strong and consistent evidence that day-to-day petty corruption is positively associated with psychological distress. Our results are robust to a variety of specification checks. Further, we find that the relationship between corruption and mental health is stronger for women, and that there are no heterogeneous effects by poverty status. An examination of the underlying mechanisms shows that reductions in income and trust associated with higher corruption may play a role. Finally, using a difference-in-difference estimation strategy, we also provide suggestive evidence that a recent high profile anti-corruption campaign had significant positive effects on mental health.

In order to fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we extended the operations strategy to the TOC context to examine with more precision the influence of TOC elements upon the competitive priorities high speed, on-time delivery, high flexibility, low cost, and high quality. A multi-method approach was adopted, combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Findings suggest that the primary competitive dimensions leveraged by TOC elements are on-time delivery and high speed, followed by high flexibility. Also, primarily, Scheduling Process (DBR and S-DBR), Critical Chain Project Management, TOC Replenishment for Distribution and Dynamic Buffer Management influence the competitive dimensions with different intensity levels and overlaps. The first contribution of this paper is in offering a better comprehension of the significant overlaps existing between various TOC elements and their simultaneous influence on firm's operational performance. Second, we provide prescriptive strategies to firms for prioritising managerial efforts and resources while implementing TOC elements, in isolation or combined with other management philosophies. Third, the paper enhances understanding of how to improve decision-making and to manage conflicting strategic objectives affecting the firms’ competitiveness. The added value and originality of this paper is in (i) minimising the lack of knowledge regarding whether and how TOC elements affect the competitive priorities in operations strategy; (ii) enable decision-makers to evaluate their continuous improvement initiatives adopted as part of the operations strategy and, eventually, select other managerial philosophies to enhance the competitive dimensions and operational performance; (iii) enable a better organisational design, attenuating the trade-offs among conflicting strategic objectives in OSCM. © 2020","Competitive dimensions; Continuous Improvement; Operational performance; Operations Management; Operations Strategy; Theory of Constraints","Competition; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Managers; Scheduling; Supply chain management; Competitive dimension; Competitive priorities; Continuous improvements; High Speed; Knowledge gaps; Operation management; Operation strategy; Operational performance; Operations and supply chain managements; Theory of constraint; Philosophical aspects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101957816

Viewing our research materials through different images helps us to ask new questions, open up new kinds of answers and ultimately other ways of knowing gender and leadership in academia. Our approach has three connected steps. Firstly, we engage with the ruins of the three main promises upon which the contemporary university has been built: enlightenment, liberalism, and feminism, drawing on Anna Tsing's mushrooms at the end of the world and Gibson-Graham's notion of a post-capitalist economy. Secondly, we use intersectionality as a methodological lens, combining it with Karen Barad's ideas about how “matter comes to matter.” We explore the intersections between four themes arising from the accounts of our participants: Reshaping the disciplinary field; gender, class, and race; traveling and mobility; and Institutional structures and policies. The third and final step engages with how some women successfully coordinate these intersecting themes to navigate their careers and achieve leadership positions within the contaminated and ruinous university environment. In doing so, we draw on the musical form of the fugue with its four themes that at different moments diverge, clash and, if successful, achieve resolution, to provide us with a way for analyzing the women's stories as “polyphony-in-action.” By using this musical approach to retool intersectionality, we are able to show how some women managed to bring all four themes of their lives into symbiosis and achieve value in the ruinous academic landscape. © 2021 The Authors.

We sampled and characterised municipal household waste in Denmark to investigate the impact of recycling schemes on the composition and generation of residual household waste (RHW), provide detailed waste data to waste management authorities as well as LCA practitioners. In total, 20 ton of waste, taken from 1,800 households in seven Danish municipalities in 2011 and 2017, was manually sorted. These municipalities had in common the systems for source separation of paper, cardboard, metal and glass, whereas the recycling of food and plastic varied among them. The waste sorting campaigns provided detailed composition of individual recycling scheme including (1) food, (2) plastic, (3) paper, (4) cardboard, (5) metal, and (6) glass as well as (7) RHW. For each of the six recycling schemes, waste was sorted into two different waste catalogues containing 48 and 50 fractions. Such a detailed waste composition enables waste management authorities to design comprehensive guidelines for waste sorting, while providing LCA practitioners with data that can significantly improve the validity and certainty of their results and recommendations. The results show that the highest misplacement rate was found in waste bins dedicated to food, plastic and RHW. The statistical analyses show that source separation of food and plastic waste reduces significantly (11%) the total amount of household waste, suggesting that, in addition to the environmental benefit of diverting food and plastic waste from landfill and incineration, source segregation may as well contribute to waste prevention. Moreover, the source-sorting of food waste, independently of whether plastics were sorted or not, significantly influences the composition of the RHW. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Food and plastic waste; Life cycle assessment; Log-ratio coordinates; Municipal solid waste composition; Recycling scheme","Bins; Cardboard; Food waste; Glass; Information management; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Plastic recycling; Sorting; Source separation; Waste management; Environmental benefits; Household waste; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Municipal household waste; Plastic wastes; Waste composition; Waste management systems; Waste prevention; Waste incineration; Bins; Glass; Life Cycle; Sorting; Source Separation; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101652108

However, policies for this field also reflect deeper-rooted traditions, institutional processes and ways of working: what looks the same can be very different when viewed in context. In this paper, we first consider the evidence for convergence across research and innovation policies before outlining perspectives based on contextual difference. Drawing particularly upon institutional theory, organizational studies and Science & Technology Studies (STS), we introduce the concept of ‘isomorphic difference’ as a means of symmetrically exploring relations of familiarity and distinctiveness. An illustration from Danish research and innovation policy is developed in order to bring together these conceptual but also policy-related issues. In addition, an initial analytical framework is presented. Finally, the relevance of ‘isomorphic difference’ to larger contemporary debates over the direction of research and innovation is summarized. © 2021","Institutional theory; Isomorphism; Organizational studies; Policy translation; Research and innovation policy; Science & Technology Studies","Hot topics; In contexts; Innovation policies; Institutional process; Institutional theory; Organizational studies; Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101164056

Under the multi-level institutional settings such as China, however, it is unclear in current literature as to whether central and local-level governmental R&D subsidy programs exert heterogeneous influences on recipient firms’ exploratory innovation. By employing an exclusive panel data of manufacturing firms in Jiangsu Province, this study investigates the heterogeneous effects of central and local R&D subsidies on firms’ exploratory innovation. Considering that regional innovation contexts may influence the learning and innovation of subsidy recipients, we further test the interaction effects of specialized industrial agglomeration and R&D subsidies. We find that R&D subsidies in general do promote firms’ exploratory innovation, and the local R&D subsidy exhibits a more salient effect. In addition, the positive effect of subsidies is stronger for the recipients in a highly specialized industrial agglomeration. This study contributes to R&D subsidy literature and extends our knowledge on the different roles of central and local governments in firms’ learning behaviors and technological upgrading. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","central and local governments; exploratory innovation; industrial agglomeration; public R&D subsidy","Engineering; Heterogeneous effects; Institutional setting; Interaction effect; Knowledge learning; Learning behavior; Manufacturing firms; Policy instruments; Regional innovation; Regional planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101066073

A number of 3D printing-based solutions are still at the laboratory experiment stage. Thus, understanding how to adapt 3D printing successfully is still one of the challenging issues facing the construction industry. Although the innovative literature provides clues about potentially relevant factors for construction 3D printing technology adaptation, research has still not specifically addressed this topic. This knowledge gap hampers further advancements in 3D printing for construction, launching new products, and the development of related services for the industry. Hence, as a response to the aforementioned shortcomings, this paper reveals nine potential factors and thirty-two of their measurements that determine the decision to adapt 3D printing technology for construction projects. To quantify the influence of the relevant factors and measurements, the structural equation modeling technique was employed. The results indicate that the top significant factors in ensuring the success of 3D printing technology in construction are ""technology compatibility,""""supply-side benefits,""and ""complexity.""Based on these findings, current and future 3D printing project managers may utilize the results of this study to guide their efforts in adapting this technology to produce high-value construction components and related products and to generate new business opportunities. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction industry; Construction three-dimensional (3D) printing; Influential factors; Quantitative methods; Structural equation model (SEM); Technology adaptation","Bridges; Construction industry; Project management; Service industry; Bridge constructions; Business opportunities; Construction technologies; Laboratory experiments; Project managers; Related products; Structural equation modeling techniques; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100873503

Based on the case of four major European banks, we find that innovation labs are constrained not only by existing resources and capabilities, but also by the need to satisfy both top management and managers in the core business units. They seek to do this by using integration mechanisms and by balancing incremental and radical innovation. With this study, we expand our understanding of barriers to radical BMI for incumbents, which has general implications for how managers can develop innovation processes to help their organization to engage effectively in BMI. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Barriers; Business model innovation; Digitalization; Exploration; Incumbent; Innovation lab",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100685879

Among these, the supplier–manufacturer relationship is crucial for improved organizational, business and sustainable performance. Sustainable collaboration with suppliers involves crucial decision-making processes such as continuous supplier monitoring and supplier development. Hence, a critical challenge that a company faces is to identify the key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing the performance of a supplier for sustainable collaboration. In this regard, this study focuses on identification of KPIs for an Indian home appliance company through exhaustive discussions involving multiple decision-makers. Further, a grey-based decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) model is proposed in the study for analysing the importance levels among the fifteen KPIs based on multiple stakeholder perspectives. The results of the grey structural model indicate seven KPIs as influencing KPIs and eight KPIs as influenced KPIs. The KPI ‘Information disclosure’ has been identified as the most influential KPI for the evaluation of suppliers for sustainable collaboration. The implications drawn from the result analysis model can provide meaningful insights to managers for identifying strategies towards strengthening the supplier–manufacturer relationship and achieving organizational and market competence. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","DEMATEL; grey theory; key performance indicators; relational view theory; supplier–manufacturer relationship; sustainable collaboration","competition (economics); manufacturing; modeling; performance assessment; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099541878

Further, six caselets were developed to understand the prospects, impediments, and prerequisites based on the findings of the interview and previous information gained from existing literature. The major prospects favoring transition from LE to CE found in the study are significance of 3R (reduce and reuse and recycling) approach, CE leads to competitive advantage, recycling attracts consumers in few cases, CE helps in achieving sustainability goals and reuse of materials are significant in resource conservation. There are certain impediments found such as issues associated with awareness, recyclability issues, financial challenges, and weak management vision of SMEs towards CE implementation. Other resource-based impediments were found related to trained employees, lack of experience. Whereas, consumer acceptability is also a major concern towards implementing CE. The findings of the study suggest major prerequisites towards CE implementations such as strong “management will,” innovation, technology up-gradation, training to employees, motivation, and appropriate guidelines. Government pressure to implement CE cannot be an effective step towards the transition of LE to CE. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","circular economy (CE); circular economy impediments; circular economy prerequisites; circular economy prospects; linear economy (LE); recycling; sustainable development; waste management","management practice; market transition; recycling; small and medium-sized enterprise; sustainability; sustainable development; transitional economy; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098119557

We conduct experiments in two ideologically polarized countries, the United States and Egypt. Subjects vote between enacting a reform which yields higher expected financial payoffs than the costs of implementation for all (but has indirect differential benefits for supporters of only one group of voters) versus not enacting the reform and everyone receiving lower payoffs. We find that when the groups are polarized ideologically, subjects are less likely to vote for reform when informed that another political group would differentially benefit, and more likely to support reform should their own group benefit more. When subjects are told that one group will differentially benefit from reform, they are significantly more likely to explain their vote as being influenced by their own group membership. In contrast, we find that when subjects are organized into nonpolarized groups, group membership predicts reform support less, and when there are no differential benefits for a particular group, the effect of membership on support is significantly reduced. Hence, we find that the effect of polarization on support for common value reform is contingent on the existence of indirect differential benefits and the degree of ideological polarization of the groups who receive those benefits. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Experiment; Political polarization; Reform; Voting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096438363

The paper classifies the different interpretations based on their market/non-market logic and concludes that roles are more extensive for users and providers in non-market logic interpretations, while market logic suggests that the platform acts more roles. The user is, despite the peer-to-peer connotation of the sharing economy, often quite passive.

Adherence to such regimes may be challenging for some consumers such as those with food intolerances, though, exposing them to the potential social stigma invoked by nonadherence. This article investigates how consumers with food intolerance strive to adhere to hegemonic taste regimes and avoid social stigma through a qualitative study of the quest of Danish consumers with histamine intolerance to derive pleasure from hedonic food consumption. Four coping strategies are identified: experimenting in an exploration of the liminal space between consumable and nonconsumable foods, substituting nontolerable foods by safe ones, facilitating consumption of nontolerable foods through the use of medical and technological aids, and prioritizing practices of hedonic food consumption over adverse bodily reactions. These coping strategies are conjectured to be generalizable in the context of other aesthetically oriented (sub-)cultures of consumption and suggest an alternative perspective on hedonism as minimization of loss of pleasure rather than as maximization of pleasure. The implications of the findings extend beyond the context of hedonic food consumption, though, presenting empirical evidence for and nuancing recent extensions of Goffman's theory of social stigma and providing insights on the relation between public stigma and self-stigma, on how taste regimes can be experienced as exclusive and oppressive, and on how social stigma positively reinforces hegemonic taste regimes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","food consumption; food intolerances; hedonic consumption; social stigma; taste regimes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090163402

However, neglecting the environmental impacts of production equipment, technical building services and energy supply might lead to sub-optimization or burden-shifting and thus reduced effectiveness. As an established method used in sustainability management, Life Cycle Assessment aims at calculating the environmental impacts from all life cycle stages of a product or system. In order to cope with shortcomings of the static character of life cycle models and data gaps this approach combines Life Cycle Assessment with manufacturing system simulation. Therefore, the two life cycles of product and production system are merged to assess environmental sustainability on product level. Manufacturing simulation covers the production system and Life Cycle Assessment is needed to relate the results to the final product. This combined approach highlights the influences from dynamic effects in manufacturing systems on resulting life cycle impact from both product and production system. Furthermore, the importance of considering indirect peripheral equipment and its effects on the manufacturing system operation in terms of output and energy demands is underlined. The environmental flows are converted into impacts for the five recommended environmental impact categories. Thus, it can be demonstrate that Life Cycle Assessment can enhance the process simulation and help identify hot-spots along the life cycle. The combined methodology is applied for analysing a case study in fourteen scenarios for the integration of volatile energy sources into energy flexible manufacturing control. © 2020, The Author(s).","Energy flexibility; Energy flexible manufacturing systems; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle manufacturing system simulation; Manufacturing system simulation; Product-specific environmental footprints","Energy resources; Environmental impact; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Environmental footprints; Environmental sustainability; Flexible manufacturing; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Manufacturing simulation; Manufacturing system simulations; Production equipments; Sustainability managements; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087564732

The analysis reveals that the conceptual structure of the model features numerous poorly outlined concepts and mismatches, which gives rise to a language game of pseudo-realism that is liable to produce illusory control practices. We show that poorly developed performance measurement concepts create an environment wherein top managers are not made accountable for results, thus generating a culture of delusions and arbitrary power. We also find a circumvention of the principal–agent model. The assumption of Danish governmental institutions seems to be that management has access to more information about alternative courses of action and their consequences than university scholars.

Our application of the OBC model offers actionable guidelines for generating original research ideas, as well as theoretical grounding for each element of the model. Given the publication pressure felt by young academic researchers, we hope that our discussion provides encouragement and guidance, which will result in original, courageous business-to-business marketing research. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Assumptions; Business marketing; Courageous ideas; OBC model; Observe-bridge-challenge model; Original ideas; Research; Theory development",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083489293

The study finds four overlapping levels of legitimacy—“acceptance,” “image,” “endorsement,” and “synergy” (a combination of acceptance and efficiency)—that subsidiaries co-develop throughout the internationalization process. We bring new insight into legitimation: that an isomorphism perspective of legitimacy alone cannot explain the complexity of subsidiary legitimation in an institutional void because subsidiaries not only earn acceptance by compliance, but also create/co-create image, endorsement, and synergy as outputs of institutional innovation. We contribute to the global strategic management in emerging economies. Managerial Summary: We investigate how MNE-civil society interplay co-develops different levels of legitimacy in an institutional void, as opposed to only the “acceptance” level. The study combines both rule-accepting and rule-changing perspectives, revealing that MNEs' strategic endeavors yield overlapping, yet increasing, levels of legitimacy—“acceptance,” “image,” “endorsement,” and “synergy”—in internationalization. These levels are not necessarily derived from a firm's strategic initiatives using an isomorphism perspective; instead, the firm appears as an institutional entrepreneur and co-develops new institutions, which creates synergy (legitimacy + efficiency) for the firm's operation. Although it is difficult to separate the increasing levels of legitimacy, managers can use the insights to design specific strategies for each level of legitimacy and develop partnerships with local actors in legitimation in an institutional void. © 2020 Strategic Management Society","civil society; institutional void; internationalization; legitimacy levels; legitimation; multinational enterprise; strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077910207

Strategies to learn heuristics that accept a bias, that is, a systematic deviation of predictions from actual outcomes, can outperform unbiased strategies because they can reduce the variance component of prediction error: the degree to which random fluctuations in observational data are inappropriately generalized. We demonstrate how strategists who are aware of the trade-off between bias and variance can learn heuristics more effectively if they are also aware of the relevant characteristics of their learning environment.

In this essay, we suggest that this engagement should include strategy’s linkage to the history of military strategy. We develop our argument through an exegesis of Carl von Clausewitz’ treatise On War. We claim that Clausewitz’ theorization of strategy advances the ongoing scholarly conversation on the practice of strategy in three specific ways. First, he defines a distinctive locus for the notion of strategy as the bridge between policy and tactics; in so doing, he addresses what has been criticized as strategy’s conceptual drift. Second, with Clausewitz, we can pose the question of strategy’s effectiveness in a critical, reflexive way. This opens up a way to answer the “so-what” question that has hampered strategy as practice research. Third, as an educator in military affairs of the Crown Prince, Clausewitz invites reflection on strategy’s pedagogy. Following Clausewitz, strategy may not want to concern itself with distilling the next practice from past history but immerse strategy students in great detail in history in order to develop their critical faculties. © The Author(s) 2019.","Clausewitz; history; policy; strategy as practice; tactics; war",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068160663

Simultaneously, little attention has been paid to the affective aspects of practices. This article seeks to combine the perspectives from these diverse fields. We argue for a need to understand the affective as engrained in the practices of attuning atmospheres. In this way, affect is not a noun with a clear ontological status; it only takes such status through verbal or adjectival forms as qualities of materialities connected to bodily practices of affecting and being affected. This necessitates that the lived body become an entry point for exploring how individuals actively are attuned and attune themselves and others through atmospheres. © The Author(s) 2019.","affect; affective atmospheres; atmospheric practices; practice theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060596771

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper is based on the relevant literature and examines the necessity to move beyond traditional education curricula by offering a new practical sustainable framework for facilitating ESD at Danish lower secondary schools. A particular focus relates to evaluating and adopting sustainable approaches in the educational literature that is sufficiently sensitive to practical changes in Danish lower secondary teaching methods. Findings: With the purpose of generating awareness about climate change and students’ ecological footprint to lower secondary school students in Denmark, it was found that embedding ESD in the Danish curriculum would be an important tool for this purpose. The authors outline practical recommendations for managers at the lower secondary school level. Originality/value: This conceptual paper addresses the core issue of traditional education in Danish lower secondary schools by suggesting to adopt the educational framework of ESD. To this end, the authors have offered a variety of specific practical suggestions accordingly to how traditional education can be redesigned by focusing on action-oriented learning and future-oriented ESD. Furthermore, the authors propose that certain educational components of smart cities might promote an underlying commitment to meet the core issues of climate change, as this has yet to be examined.

Persistent problems around the dominant “individual-opportunity” approach in the entrepreneurship field motivated the authors to focus on the social-interactive aspects and action orientation of entrepreneurship. The work promises to address the challenge of providing a more integrated account in which the entrepreneur’s agency is combined with a greater emphasis on the social environment. The importance of social relations and the associated interactions between entrepreneurs and their environment give insight into key entrepreneurial processes. The authors address the guiding questions of what a viable network is for (nascent) entrepreneurs and how networking activities affect their entrepreneurial endeavors. Therefore, they first create a synthesis of key network mechanisms and networking dynamics. This allows them (a) to shed new light on the origins of opportunities and improve understanding of how entrepreneurs access resources and subsequently mobilize and deploy them, and (b) to explain how entrepreneurs build legitimacy, facilitating them to act on perceived new combinations and thereby exploit their potential. Thus, this book highlights how networking is a central constitutive force in entrepreneurship. Previous work showed how networks can or will lead to entrepreneurial action as a facilitator. Going one step further, the authors posit that networking is entrepreneurial action, and entrepreneurial action is networking, thereby opening an entirely new research agenda. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Action; Agency; Dynamics; Entrepreneurship; Legitimacy; Mechanism; Network ties; Networking; Resource; Social-interactive",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109107118

In the present work, functionalizing of WCO to polymeric surfactants through a cleaner approach with high emulsification ability for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) of fossil crude and enhanced biocrudes solubility in petroleum crudes is proposed. The influence of synthesis conditions (temperature, time and concentration of reactants) on intermediates and the resulting polymeric surfactants was investigated. Products were characterized by UV–Vis, 1H NMR, FT-IR, and DLS technique, and particle stability and Zeta potential were evaluated. The results showed the high stability of the fossil crude-surfactant-brine emulsion. The affinity of the polymeric surfactant for EOR under Danish reservoir was also investigated. It was observed that the IFT of brine-surfactant emulsion (31.35 dyn/cm) was reduced to almost half compared to neat saline water (68.82 dyn/cm), and that the viscosity of fossil crude oil in presence of polymeric surfactant was significantly decreased. Finally, the polymeric surfactant was employed to assess compatibility of hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis biocrudes with fossil refinery streams with an aim to promote their integration into existing refinery. Consequently, the correlation between compatibility and molecular structure was drawn based on the experimental investigation on miscibility studies. The results obtained during the phase behaviour and IFT studies showed the high emulsification ability of functionalized polymeric surfactant for the enhanced crude oil recovery at reservoir conditions.

This process has a low efficiency and causes air pollution. Biomass pyrolysis is an advanced thermochemical process, which can replace smouldering and hence, transition the production towards a circular process. Liquid smoke has a mature and steadily growing market, which provides an opportunity to commercialise biomass pyrolysis. This study addresses opportunities to produce liquid smoke by pyrolysis technologies. Recently developed technologies are reviewed including biomass pretreatment, fast pyrolysis, microwave pyrolysis and fractional condensation. They are considered as promising approaches for liquid smoke production. The advantage of liquid smoke production by fast pyrolysis is the higher gross profit over biofuel oil production. Challenges also exist in this transformation because of more requirements for food products manufacture such as food safety standards and sensory quality specifications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioactive compounds; Biomass pyrolysis; Food flavouring; Liquid smoke; Technology transformation","Air quality; Biomass; Food products; Food safety; Liquids; Oils and fats; Petroleum industry; Pyrolysis; Biomass pre treatments; Biomass pyrolysis; Circular process; Fast pyrolysis; Growing markets; Microwave pyrolysis; Sensory qualities; Thermo chemical process; Smoke",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097250719

However, the current sustainability labeling landscape is up against the challenge of too much, too complex, too similar, and too ambiguous information. Therefore, sustainability labeling schemes are looked upon as failing to support sustainability-involved consumers sufficiently. Meta sustainability labeling has been proposed as a means to reduce these challenges and strengthen the benefits of sustainability labeling. However, there is a need for systematically taking stock of and synthesizing what is known and what is yet unknown about meta sustainability labeling as input to decisions and development work regarding this instrument. This systematic literature review investigates how a meta sustainability label has been defined and assessed compared to existing, single-issue sustainability labels. First, four characteristic elements of a meta sustainability label are identified: multi-dimensionality, meta, multi-level, and universal. Second, a distinction between a meta sustainability label scheme and an integrated sustainability label scheme is proposed, the distinguishing characteristic being the (graphical) communication to the consumer. Third, benefits and disadvantages as well as facilitators of and impediments to implementing a meta sustainability scheme are identified. There is no consensus in the literature about the likelihood of a meta sustainability label doing a better job than existing sustainability labeling schemes. Perhaps the most important finding is that the debate regarding meta sustainability labeling is still in its infancy and lacks a proper evidence base. Thus, we encourage marketing and sustainability researchers to continue investigating meta sustainability labeling as a potentially useful tool for sustainability transformation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behavior; Ecolabel; Literature review; Meta label; Product labeling; Sustainability","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Characteristic elements; Labeling scheme; Multidimensionality; Multilevels; Sustainable consumption; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100647517

Producing these materials as by-products along with the main products of any industry or project can multiply the financial benefits of economic processes. Many of these processes today use fossil fuels that have two major problems: non-renewability and environmental pollution. To make greener these economic processes, efforts are being made today to use sustainable raw materials. Also, the use of biomaterials in the production of high-value materials is essential to achieve a low-carbon and circular economy. In this comprehensive review, the production processes of high value-added materials are summarized in simple forms. In addition to reviewing processes, the most important raw materials for the production of these valuable materials have also been widely discussed. As two very important issues, the relationship between the food supply chain and conversion of its waste into high value-added materials as well as the conversion of carbon dioxide into high-value materials has also been investigated. Finally, the high potential of using these sustainable materials in a greener economic direction was shown. In general, it can be said that these environmentally friendly materials must also make economic progress. However, recent advances have been made to reduce the cost of producing some of these materials. To have a greener economy in the future, the number of processes and production materials that are economically viable must increase. The use of waste from the food supply chain must also be given significant consideration. The production of valuable materials from CO2 is also essential. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass conversion processes; Biomass processing; Circular economy; Low-carbon materials; Renewable energy sources","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Supply chains; Conversion process; Economically viable; Environmental pollutions; Financial benefits; Production process; Reviewing process; Sustainable materials; Sustainable raw materials; Biomaterials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100642882

In this paper, sewage sludge and food waste were co-fermented to produce carboxylic acids and study the subsequent chain elongation process. The Copenhagen waste stream scenario was taken as a case study. Firstly, design of experiments was used to investigate the overall carboxylic acids and hexanoic acid production in batch, as a function of the co-fermentation ratio, substrate to co-culture ratio and initial pH. Optimal operating conditions for hexanoic acid were obtained with SS/FW 6.61, S/Xo 6.73 and initial pH 6.83. Statistical optimization increased the overall carboxylic acid titer by 41%, while co-fermentation allowed to increase hexanoate annual production up to 77%. Furthermore, a continuous fermentation experiment was performed to study the effect of reactor operating conditions. The overall carboxylates titer was 2 times higher, which also favored chain elongation compared to batch mode. An increasing loading rate did not affect the overall carboxylate titer, however the hexanoic acid titer increased by 44%. A maximum titer of 4.9 g/l of hexanoic acid was produced, achieving a productivity of 2.46 g/l/d of hexanoic acid with a retention time of 2 d and no external electron donor addition. This would correspond to 610 t/y of hexanoic acid and 350 t/y of other carboxylic acids that could be produced, based on the waste availability in Copenhagen. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carboxylic acids; Chain elongation; Co-fermentation; Food waste; Hexanoic acid; Sewage sludge","Carboxylation; Design of experiments; Elongation; Fermentation; Food waste; Saturated fatty acids; Sewage sludge; Annual production; Chain elongation; Continuous fermentation; External electrons; Fermented sludge; Operating condition; Optimal operating conditions; Statistical optimization; Substrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100256949

Blight affects people's lives in many ways, including economically, socially, psychologically, and physically. The phenomenon comprises many factors, including making appropriate identification and eradication decisions that are challenging to analyze and structure. This study took a constructivist stance and sought to develop a new approach to urban blight to complement the existing literature. The methodology combined cognitive mapping techniques applied in decision conferences, and the decision making trial and evaluation laboratory technique based on the multiple-criteria decision analysis approach. This integrated approach facilitated the development of a multi-criteria model that identifies proactive anti-blight measures in a more complete, transparent way. This dual methodology enables incorporating objective and subjective elements, and field specialists’ knowledge and experiences, thereby reducing important decision criteria omissions. Additionally, this approach generates a transparent visualization of relationships among criteria. Identified blight determinants can be used to prevent blight, and improve the quality of life in the affected areas. These strategies were carefully analyzed by two independent experts from the Direção Geral do Território (General Directorate of the Territory of Portugal).

However, these effects are not clear due to the limited observations and difficulties in separating impact of social distancing. COVID-19 data and social-economic features of 1236 regions in the world (1112 regions at the provincial level and 124 countries with the small land area) were collected. Large-scale satellite data was combined with these data with a regression analysis model to explore the effects of temperature and relative humidity on COVID-19 spreading, as well as the possible transmission risk by seasonal cycles. The result shows that temperature and relative humidity are negatively correlated with COVID-19 transmission throughout the world. Government intervention (e.g. lockdown policies) and lower population movement contributed to decrease the new daily case ratio. Weather conditions are not the decisive factor in COVID-19 transmission, in that government intervention as well as public awareness, could contribute to the mitigation of the spreading of the virus. So, it deserves a dynamic government policy to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in winter. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Covid-19; Government intervention; Subnational data; Transmission; Weather condition","Meteorology; Risk assessment; Temperature; Viruses; Effects of temperature; Government intervention; Large-scale satellites; Limited observations; Public awareness; Regression analysis models; Temperature and humidities; Temperature and relative humidity; Transmissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099981415

Consideration is given to nonimaging sensors carried on UAVs. Input to GIS provides a basis to create visually realistic models of the 'built-environmenť for urban and rural planning and decision-making for sustainable urbanisation. 3D visualisation software, virtual, and augmented reality will allow public engagement with the spatial planning process.

The common layout is a multidimensional construct. While the perception of the complexity of projects is essential for a managerial approach, only scant research has been conducted into how practitioners perceive project complexity. The purpose of the paper is to fill this gap. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a quantitative study based on a large survey among managers of projects with more than 1,000 participants. The questionnaire is designed based on a review of research literature on project complexity. Findings: The findings indicate that practitioners' mental models are concentrated on only a few dimensions of the many found in descriptive models. Further, the findings indicate that the mental models are much influenced by the project role of the perceiver and less so by the type of project and sector. Originality/value: This paper discusses the differentiation of concepts of perceived project complexity and provides a framework for a survey of the topic. The contribution of the paper is an increased understanding of practitioners' perceptions of project complexity as a concept very different from the descriptive frameworks that have been the focal point for research in project complexity thus far. The project complexity might be in the eye of the beholder; however, the findings indicate that the eyes are very much influenced by the project role of the beholder. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Descriptive project complexity; Mental models; Perceived project complexity; Survey of characteristics of project complexity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088791348

Often, the problem with management is not theoretical, but practical. Managers know enough about leadership, but a lot of them do not act accordingly. They know what should be done in a given situation but fear the discomfort and uncertainty that comes with it. The fear keeps many managers from stepping up to their responsibility. Therefore, the fear in leadership is playing a decisive role in the life and effectiveness of organizations. Based on research on the theoretical knowledge and the practical behavior of managers, combined with a long-time experience as consultants, the authors argue for the importance of practical judgment and emotional courage in management. This is essential in acting as an authentic leader, who does not feel paralyzed and trapped in paradoxes. Management books typically address the question of ""what is good management,"" whereas this book is concerned with how to practice good management by exercising fearless leadership and emotional courage. It is a practical book that aims at inspiring the reader to act by providing specific tools and methods and will be of value to researchers, academics, practitioners, and students in the fields of leadership, strategic management, organizational studies and behavior, management development, and industrial and organizational psychology. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

For this, the overall experiment had 23 participants, the outcome was then matched against a control group and evaluated through a survey with 146 representatives of the target group of the product. The results show that the Lean Startup approach outperforms the traditional approach and that this method improves the success rate of innovation ideas and thus supports the learning philosophy within established companies. Moreover, the experiment revealed a superior performance, especially relating to financial output.

Due to this network connectivity between people, organizations, resources and entire industries, value and economic growth can be generated within the interactive ecosystem of digital platforms. The special feature of this business model is that competitive advantages, contrary to dominant paradigms, do not primarily rely on the physical infrastructure or the control over scarce and valuable resources. Despite the high practical relevance, little systematic knowledge exists on why platform-based business models often outperform traditional pipeline businesses in many respects. We contribute to this research gap by exploring the critical success factors of platform business models. Based on a qualitative analysis on digital platforms in the metal and steel industry, we identify six key success factors of platform-based business models: We relate these success factors to the design of the three dimensions of business models as described in the literature: (1) value creation, (2) value delivery, and (3) value capture dimensions. Furthermore, our analysis could extend these and design features of the business model by three additional success factors (4) the promotion and sensitization of digital transformation, (5) a suitable platform architecture and strategic judgement of platform providers, as well as (6) the promotion of a start-up culture as central success factors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Business model; Digital business model; Digitalization; Platform; Qualitative analysis; Steel industry; Success factors","Competition; Steelmaking; Competitive advantage; Critical success factor; Digital transformation; Key success factors; Network connectivity; Platform architecture; Potential customers; Qualitative analysis; Factor analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105591919

Due to time-inconsistency of mean variance criterion, a dynamic formulation of the problem is presented. We obtain the dynamically optimal (time-consistent) strategy explicitly, which is shown to keep the wealth process strictly below the target (expected terminal wealth) before the terminal time.

Drawing on an ethnographic study of work practice in Berber communities in Morocco, aspects of respect are analyzed through an honor-shame continuum that serves to moralize and mediate gender relations. The findings show that respect and shame function as key inequality-(re)producing mechanisms. The dynamic interrelationship between respect and shame has implications for how we understand the ways in which gender inequality is institutionalized and (re)produced across different levels.

However, within literature, there is a lack of generic and systematic attention to the agency of the citizens. This article aims to respond to this criticism and answer the questions: How do citizens cope with public encounters? Do citizen behaviors towards public authorities divide into distinct, meaningful, multidimensional behavior types? Through an explorative theory-based approach, the article opens those questions. Based on self-reported survey-data on behavior, from a representative sample of Danish citizens, we use latent class analysis (LCA) to identify systematic patterns in citizens' behavior towards public authorities (exemplified by Tax and Home Care Referral authorities). We identify five types of citizen coping behavior in public encounters: ""Resisters,""""Activists,""""Accommodators,""""Flighters,""and ""Cooperators.""The five types of coping behaviors can be placed in a three-dimensional space measuring degree of activity, degree of preparation, and degree of opposition. We suggest that this insight and conceptual framework of citizen coping behavior can create a starting point for researchers to embark a research agenda on citizens' coping behavior in citizen-state encounters. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Our suggestions are applicable to designing any intervention in supply chain research, but need tailoring to the local context. Our interventions were aimed at achieving decent working conditions in emerging-country suppliers, but our insights are applicable for all supply chain scholars. In the context of emerging-country suppliers, poor working conditions have been strongly criticized after the Rana Plaza accident and subsequently received more attention with the UN’s introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals (notably, SDG 8). Tensions between productivity-enhancing and decent work logics create challenges for the design of interventions with long-lasting performance improvements.

The long term sustainability of the MaaS platforms depends on their pricing strategy and whether they can generate sufficient volume from customers and encourage suppliers to do business with them. The objective of the paper is to develop optimal prices which a MaaS platform can charge to maximize its own profit as well as joint profit for itself and its supplier. Game theoretic models based on Hotelling's model are developed to determine the prices. We consider scenarios when the platform charges and does not charge subscription fees. We also determine conditions for the supplier to join the platform. Our models are motivated by real problems faced by a MaaS platform and have been validated using data provided by the platform. The models, the conditions developed and the insights obtained by validating the models using real data provide guidance to MaaS platforms to improve their business sustainability. The paper thus shows that MaaS platforms, when successfully designed, with appropriate pricing models can create an effective and economically sustainable business ecosystem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Competition; Manufacturing as a service (MaaS); Optimal pricing; Platforms; Spatial market","Costs; Game theory; Manufacture; Profitability; Sustainable development; Business sustainability; Digital platforms; Game-theoretic model; Long-term sustainability; Manufactured products; Provide guidances; Service platforms; Sustainable business; Platform as a Service (PaaS)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100879230

Previous studies have focused on how these kinds of organisations respond to external demands by implementing appropriate governance structures. This, however, produces an understanding of programme organisations as being unitary and working to integrate programme activities and practices under one dominant internal institutional logic. In this paper, we study the consequences of internal logic multiplicity for the governance of programme organisations. Drawing on data from a major Danish construction programme we show how, in order to achieve its mission, the programme organisation incorporates three distinct logics into its daily activities and practices. The findings illustrate how a compartmentalised structural approach is applied to differentiate and independently deal with the three logics in structurally distinct organisational spaces. To avoid fragmentation and ensure coordination, governance mechanisms are put in place that coordinate activities and practices across the organisational spaces whilst maintaining their compartmentalisation. The paper thus contributes to the literature on programme management with insights on how the institutional context influences programme structures and operations, and how governance mechanisms are implemented to manage activities and practices across organisational spaces guided by different logics. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Construction industry; Governance; Hybrid organisation; Infrastructure development; Institutional logic; Organisational space; Programme management","Public policy; Complex environments; Construction programme; Governance mechanisms; Governance structures; Infrastructure development; Institutional contexts; Programme management; Programme structures; Computer circuits; construction industry; governance approach; infrastructural development; institutional framework; management; organizational framework; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100753637

It explores how themes traditionally belonging to the humanities have spurred critical inquiry and raised theoretical issues within other disciplines, following the crisis of the classical humanist ideal as ‘the measure of all things’. It focuses on how the tensions resulting from this crisis can be constructively thematized in the field of management and organization studies, and how the unsettling of the humanities’ privileged access to studying the ‘especially human’ can be taken into the classroom. In this manner, the special issue engages with questions related to the Anthropocene, posthumanism and transhumanism, and raises issues concerning the human possibilities for knowing, learning and living in entangled ways. Additionally, it helps us understand the critical role of the humanities in making sense of the reciprocities between imagination, information and the human crafting of meaningful knowledge. © The Author(s) 2021.","Anthropocene; humanities; liberal arts; management education; posthumanism; transhumanism",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100450242

It was found that the linear wear measurements can be effectively performed by the Touch method when larger tool electrode diameters are used and sufficient machining is performed between the two control intervals, whereas the volumetric wear should be measured by the Laser method.

The average effect of a sexual harassment scandal is significantly negative and robust, with around 1.5% abnormal decrease in market value over the event day and the following trading day. In the cross section, the effect is considerably amplified by the involvement of a CEO in the scandal and high news coverage, while firms' self-disclosure of misconduct mitigates the effect. The average magnitude of impact is unchanged before and after the #MeToo movement, but the frequency of scandals in the media translates to a four-fold increase in the risk of becoming embroiled in a scandal. Proxies of public sentiment rather than direct penalties and loss of productivity are found to correlate with the magnitude of impact. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Company value; Corporate scandals; MeToo; Sexual harassment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099202696

Mediation via the Telenoid robot also produced more non-structured agreements, which consisted of decisions made outside of the scenario options. Negotiators in this condition had more positive perceptions of the mediation experience, were more satisfied with the outcome, and thought that the mediator’s advice was more useful.

Our philosophical essay addresses this question by excavating Jacques Rancière’s conception of intellectual emancipation and showing its practical relevance for experiments with emancipatory teaching in a business school environment. Speaking from within a tradition where the meaning of human is irrevocably unsettled, Rancière, remarkably, still insists on an essential link between emancipation and humanism – although in a minimal version. First, we show why and how Rancière’s analyses of emancipation are united by the common concern to affirm such a minimal humanism. Thereafter, we describe how three features sets intellectual emancipation apart from social and aesthetic emancipation and makes it pertinent to take intellectual emancipation to school: The possibility and intention to emancipate others, the acknowledgement of the constructive role of reason herein, and the significance of teacher authority in doing so. Lastly, we move beyond and problematize Rancière’s clear conceptual account of intellectual emancipation by extracting three heuristic pedagogical devices from it and by recounting their confrontation with the messy details of our teaching practice at the business school. © The Author(s) 2020.","Business school teaching; intellectual emancipation; Jacques Rancière; minimal humanism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095946599

The analysis is divided into 3 periods: before and after the VAT hike and during the financial crisis, with the total time period from 2003 to 2013. The sample is composed of 23,388 Portuguese unique firms with 5.1 year-observations per firm. The impact of the massive VAT change is assessed in comparison to the performance of 4,969 Greek and 59,841 Spanish (for robustness) unique firms for the exact time period. The results show that a dramatic VAT increase significantly affects firm profitability in the country of implementation, with the effect even more dramatic than the recent financial crisis. The equivalent to the proposed 10 percent VAT rise in Portugal has caused a significant decline in firm profitability (an average drop of 8.7% compared to 1.5% during the financial crisis), a massive increase in the number of inactive firms and amplified the likelihood of firms to become bankrupt by about three times. Such consequences inevitably affect unemployment and may cause a slump in tax revenue in the long run. Hence, this research has wide practical implications and should be considered by the Greek and Portuguese governments before taking a next step of intervening in the tourism sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Financial crisis; Firm bankruptcy; Impact; Profitability; Value-added tax; VAT change","economic impact; financial crisis; industrial performance; profitability; survival; tax system; tourism economics; tourism market; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093656660

Many studies investigating dishonesty rely on (one of) a few well-established lab and online cheating paradigms. Quite surprisingly, though, the external validity of these paradigms has only been investigated in a small number of studies, raising the question of whether behavior in these paradigms is related to real-life dishonesty or, more broadly, socially questionable behavior. Tackling this gap, we link observed behavior in two widely used cheating paradigms to approval rates on two crowdworking platforms (namely, Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk) using data from four studies (overall N = 5,183). Results indicate that lower approval rates are associated with higher proportions of dishonest individuals. Importantly, this relation also holds for crowdworkers who exceed commonly used thresholds for study inclusion. The results thus support the external validity of (two widely used) cheating paradigms. Further, the study identifies approval rates as a variable that explains dishonesty on crowdworking platforms. © 2020 The Authors.

As visitor attractions are operating in the highly relevant and competitive tourism industry, satisfaction generation for their visitors is a key to success and a competitive advantage. To positively affect visitor satisfaction (VS), existing research mostly suggest increasing visit durations (VD) (i.e., a positive effect of VD on VS). However, contrary findings also appeared; thus, it remains unclear why and under which conditions the positive effect occurs and is leveraged or weakened. This study empirically analyses moderating and mediating effects on the VD-VS association using a visitor survey. Visitors' previous experience with other related visitor attractions, importance of recommendations by others to the visitation decision, and visitors' personal life satisfaction were included as moderating variables, value for money was added as the mediating variable. Results indicate that the VD–VS association is strengthened, with higher levels of visitors' previous experience with other related visitor attractions, with decreasing levels of importance of recommendations by others to the visitation decision, and with decreasing levels of visitors' personal life satisfaction. Moreover, value for money mediates the effect of visit duration on visitor satisfaction. As such, this study provides practical insights into a more visitor segment-specific utilization of VD for managing VS more efficiently and contributes to the visitor attraction literature by investigating variables influencing the VD–VS relationship. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Value for money; Visit duration; Visitor attraction; Visitor behaviour; Visitor satisfaction; Visitor segmentation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087958430

However, despite attempts to consolidate the domain of SF, there remain theoretical and empirical tensions underlying its antecedents, the consequences and contingencies. Based on 106 independent samples reported in 98 different studies (n = 26,940 firms), we provide a meta-analytical examination of these tensions. We highlight and resolve several disagreements regarding the enablers, inhibitors and triggers of SF, and we reveal an adjusted mean performance effect of 0.24. We further find that the measurement of SF, as well as some, but not all, dimensions of the environment, moderate the performance effect. Finally, an explorative analysis reveals that innovation outcomes and market outcomes mediate the positive relationship between SF and financial outcomes, in addition to a negative direct effect. These insights provide a comprehensive and coherent understanding of the nomological network of SF and a stronger basis for further theorizing and conducting empirical research. Moreover, our findings help firms to refine their strategy by implementing the right enablers that drive SF and to understand how and when their investment in SF pays off. © 2020 The Authors.

To address this online path planning issue, neural networks, which can derive a heading for an operating vehicle in a given situation, have been actively studied, demonstrating their satisfactory performance. However, the study on the training path data, which specifies the desired output of a neural network and in turn influences the behavior of the neural network, has been neglected in the literature. Motivated by this fact, in this paper, we first generate different training path data sets applying two different offline path planning algorithms and evaluate the performance of a neural network as an online path planner depending on the training data under a simulation environment.

The prospective outlook of predictive modeling, where a model predicts unseen or new data, can complement the retrospective nature of causal-explanatory modeling that dominates the field. Partial least squares (PLS) path modeling is an excellent tool for building theories that offer both explanation and prediction. A limitation of PLS, however, is the lack of a statistical test to assess whether a proposed or alternative theoretical model offers significantly better out-of-sample predictive power than a benchmark or an established model. Such an assessment of predictive power is essential for theory development and validation, and for selecting a model on which to base managerial and policy decisions. We introduce the cross-validated predictive ability test (CVPAT) to conduct a pairwise comparison of predictive power of competing models, and substantiate its performance via multiple Monte Carlo studies. We propose a stepwise predictive model comparison procedure to guide researchers, and demonstrate CVPAT's practical utility using the well-known American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) model. © 2020 The Authors.

Theory development involves high-quality conceptualization that integrates and builds on existing knowledge, possibly using a multi-disciplinary approach. Further, especially in an applied research area such as business-to-business marketing, the emerging theory will have meaningful implications for managerial decision-makers. Insightful conceptual framework development advances theory substantially, not incrementally. Theoretical development can be either purely conceptual or based on empirical data. Nevertheless, there are comparatively few guidelines for the process of conceptual framework development. This editorial discusses pathways to developing conceptual frameworks to support academic research, with emphasis on business-to-business marketing research. As guidelines and conventions are available for data-driven approaches such as grounded theory, we focus on theorizing processes in which existing theory plays a pivotal role. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Conceptual articles; Conceptual framework; Theorizing; Theory development",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083316388

Using a unique survey of privately owned enterprises in China, this paper investigates how polluting firms respond to institutional pressures. We find that polluting firms conform to external pressures by combining relational activities and clean technology investments. However, some polluting firms alleviate regulative pressures by bribing government officials, which represents an unethical relational strategy to manage political relationship. We further analyze the contingency on firm-level political connection and local institutional conditions. Political connection buffers firms from institutional demand and demotivates firms’ willingness to respond to institutional pressures; stronger local civic activism and better bureaucratic governance curb the pollution-driven bribery, but they are not strong enough to enhance environmentally friendly practices. Collectively, our study demonstrates how polluting firms navigate institutional pressures in emerging markets, and it particularly highlights the pollution-driven bribery as an obstacle to sustainability. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Bribery; Corruption; Emerging markets; Environmental pollution; Institutional pressures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074796804

Driven by mandatory reporting and other government initiatives, a large number of organisations in the European countries report on environmental matters. This chapter outlines developments in environmental disclosure regulation at the European Union level and at the member-state level. These developments have included a variety of regulatory instruments with diverse specifications that have aimed to mandate environmental information in either annual reports (financial statements) or stand-alone environmental reports. After this outline, studies of environmental reporting in European countries are reviewed. A predominant focus within these studies is the role of regulation. This is no surprise as several countries in the European region provide valuable contexts for studying policymaking in the environmental reporting arena, including the impact of mandating environmental reporting. The European region further provides interesting research opportunities that can develop an understanding of the role played by institutional contexts in environmental reporting. This research, based on empirical material from Europe, therefore provides insight into the effectiveness of regulation in promoting environmental reporting and environmental aspects.

To seize a competitive advantage, companies have emerged new technological solutions to respond to the change in the organization environment. There is a surge in the requirement of learning opportunities and effective training programs in the organization. The current study has been an effort to understand the potential of blockchain technology that can create better training evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: The electronic-Delphi (e-Delphi) method has been conducted by recording the final consensus and to find a balance for implementation of blockchain technology and measuring training effectiveness. The current research is one of its new types where blockchain-enabled training effectiveness measurement (BETEM) model has been formulated using a qualitative approach. Findings: The study has considered human resource (HR) professionals as the experts and based on their responses, the formulation of theoretical network model has been structured using e-Delphi–BETEM (e-DLH–BETEM) approach. By critically examining the experts’ responses and comments, the study formulated the four major themes and 11 subthemes for the smooth functioning of the BETEM for an organization. Research limitations/implications: The research aims to aid innovations in BETEMs model for training evaluation. The model will contribute incrementally toward the complete transformation of the training development programs of employees. The goal of BETEMs is to ensure that organizations, specifically HR personals can prepare themselves to have competitive advantage by using blockchain technology.

Design/methodology/approach: Using data from 132 Brazilian manufacturing companies, partial least square–structural equation modeling (PLS–SEM) is employed to test if soft and hard QM practices, directly, affect innovation practices and, indirectly, innovation performance. This investigation also aims to identify whether the relationships are maintained regardless of the size of the company. Findings: The results suggest that soft QM has a positive effect on hard QM. However, only soft QM, not hard QM, has a significant effect on innovation practices. Additionally, soft QM has a significant positive effect on innovation performance through innovation practices. Company size does not influence the relationships. Practical implications: The findings can help managers to adjust their managerial practices to enhance the effective impact of QM on innovation performance. Originality/value: The previous literature presents conflicting results on the relationship between QM and innovation performance.

A key issue in this regard is the development of technological capabilities at local firms in these countries. Although much research has been conducted on this topic, we currently have only limited understanding of how the learning mechanisms that these so-called latecomer firms engage in change as they deepen their capability stocks. In the present paper, we offer insights into this issue by means of a comparative analysis of nine technology-supplying firms in the Thai industry for industrial-scale biogas systems over a period of about twenty years. Our results suggest that there are indeed shifts in the relative importance of different types of learning mechanisms as firms deepen their capabilities. The paper finds that such shifts tend to follow a co-evolutionary pattern involving shifts within and across learning mechanisms that involve different sources of knowledge.

A clear disadvantage is the increase in amount of data which needs to be processed and transmitted from the battery to a server. The work presented in this paper aims to reduce the amount of data which needs to be transmitted by the extraction of descriptive features of the voltage, and then reducing the number of features. The extracted features are reduced in two stages. The first stage uses principle components analysis (PCA) and a variation proportion, p, to limit the number of features used to those accounting p% of the variation. The state-of-health is not used in this process, i.e. it is a reduction based solely on the feature set. The second stage selects features from the PCA reduced feature set. In this stage two types of selection are employed and compared: (1) step-wise selection, and (2) L1-regularisation (also called the lasso method). These methods were used to model the relationship between the features and two SOH measures: capacity and internal resistance. The two selection methods were also compared to using all features in the PCA reduced feature set – creating a total of six models (three for both of SOH measures) for each of the PCA reduced features sets. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), calculated on the validation set, never exceeded 5% for any of the three models, and at any of the PCA reduced feature sets; even when accounting for only 50% of the variation. Furthermore, if the PCA reduced feature set accounted for more than 50% of the variation, then the MAPE for the lasso method never exceeded 3%, and achieved MAPE's as low as 1.13% and 1.24%, when modelling the capacity and internal resistance, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Feature extraction; Feature selection; L1-Regularisation; Multiple linear regression; Principle components analysis; State-of-health; Step-wise selection","Health; Linear regression; Secondary batteries; Internal resistance; Laboratory testing; Mean absolute percentage error; Multiple linear regressions; Principle components analysis; Raw measurements; Selection methods; State of health; Battery management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099120731

It investigates the proposed configuration from energy, exergy, economic, and environmental aspects. The idea is conducted by the integration of the proposed system with a gasifier, a multi-effect desalination (MED) unit, and a series two-stage organic Rankine cycle (STORC) using various zeotropic mixtures for the use of waste heat for heat, power, and freshwater production. A comparative parametric study is carried out not only to evaluate the effect of main parameters on the performance of the proposed system but also to determine the best zeotropic mixture from different standpoints. In addition, the tri-objective optimization using a genetic algorithm approach is implemented to the system to ascertain the best operating condition to minimize the total cost rate and maximize the exergy efficiency and the produced fresh water simultaneously. The results of a comparative parametric study reveal the superiority of R601a-C2Butene (75%–25%) among various STORC working fluids from thermodynamic and economic points of view. The results further show that the proposed integrated system has a considerably lower CO2 index compared to the same system without the STORC unit. For the final tri-objective optimization point, while the minimum total cost rate is 64.91 $/h, the maximum exergy efficiency and produced freshwater are 23.43% and 162.86 m3/day, respectively. Furthermore, the scatter distribution of the main decision variable reveals that moisture content and current density are not a sensible variable, and their optimal points are distributed in the whole domain. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass-based PEM fuel Cell; MED; Multi-generational system; Tri-objective optimization; Zeotropic mixtures","Cost effectiveness; Desalination; Exergy; Genetic algorithms; Mixtures; Rankine cycle; Waste heat; Water; Environmental aspects; Exergy efficiencies; Genetic algorithm approach; Multi-effect desalination; Objective optimization; Operating condition; Organic Rankine cycles; Scatter distribution; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097438938

While such instances seem to be an inherent aspect of organizational ethnography, they are often silenced or camouflaged by claims of intentionality. This article takes the opposite approach, arguing for the analytical value of awkwardness. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on their respective ethnographic fieldwork in the Danish and Swedish armed forces. Based on observations, participation and interviews in two military units, the analysis focuses on situations that rarely find their way into final research publications. These will be explored as analytically productive material that can provide crucial insights into the organizational context studied. Findings: The authors’ analysis demonstrates that awkward situations that arise during ethnographic work not only bring about unforeseen insights; they also enable vital analytical opportunities for discovering silent knowledge in the organization which researchers might otherwise not have considered to inquire about or understood the gravity of. Research limitations/implications: Implied in the suggested methodological approach for ethnographers is an acceptance of awkward situations as productive encounters. This means doing away with ideals for (ethnographic) knowledge production steered by notions of objectivity, instead embracing the affective dimensions of fieldwork.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is driven by the author's experience of disconcertment during her fieldwork for a study of economic prioritization of access to new pharmaceuticals. Here she was pushed to take sides between health economists, clinicians and patients. Based on an iterative literature review, the paper identifies contemporary approaches to side-taking and discusses their practical applicability by constructing counterfactual accounts of a specific situation related to her fieldwork. Findings: The author provides an overview of three “modes of intervention” characteristic of contemporary ethnography: political activism, organizational development and intervening description. The author presents the research agenda, the methodological principles and the means of intervention of each of the three modes, and discusses their applicability to the fieldwork process.

By feeding the inputting vibration signal, features are captured adaptively and fault condition of RM is diagnosed automatically.

It addresses 33 projections for six thematic sections of the accommodation sharing industry: relevance, different forms of accommodation sharing, users, hosts, platforms, and finally, industry regulation. Findings: The results indicate that the number of shared accommodations and users of home-sharing will increase. Moreover, the cost advantage is the predominant driver for users to engage in the accommodation sharing segment, and for the hosts, the generation of an extra income is the primary incentive. Finally, the regulation within this industry is expected to be more effective in the foreseeable future.

However, the social dimension has been neglected and it can cause an irreparable outcome in the biotechnology industries. Following this issue, this study propounds a modified systemic approach for a social sustainability impact assessment of the treatment technologies for converting waste into bioenergy, based on a review on the common social assessment methods. As it is known, the guideline presented by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (2009) due to considering social life cycle assessment has a comprehensive look at the stakeholders. Therefore, in this paper, UNEP method was selected. However, it needs to be modified based on the bio-energy supply chain derived from municipal solid waste. For this purpose, the bioenergy value chain derived from municipal solid waste was designed and combined with UNEP guideline, to complete the level of stakeholder subgroups and the levels of the indicators. The final method of the social assessment system was presented to the board of experts and finalized. In order to design the measurement part of the social assessment system, because of a multi criteria decision making nature of the social sustainability evaluation of the conversion technologies of municipal solid waste to bio-energies, a recent developed multi-criteria decision making method so-called Best Worst Method (BWM) was used in two stages. The criteria are ranked according to their average weight obtained through Best Worst method. One of the major novelties in this research is the way of application of the best worst technique in the second stage. The model was implemented in the case of Tehran as one of the pioneering Iranian municipalities with high potential to produce bioenergy. The results of this study help decision makers to decide where to concentrate their attention during the implementation stage, and to increase social sustainability in their bioenergy supply chains derived waste. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Best worst method; Bioenergy; Social sustainability; Treatment technology","Decision making; Ecodesign; Economic and social effects; Life cycle; Social aspects; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Biotechnology industry; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Social sustainability; Society of environmental toxicology and chemistries; Sustainability assessment; Treatment technologies; United Nations Environment Programs; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099179116

The proposed measure is compared against traditional forecast accuracy measures in terms of the effect on availability (i.e. fill-rate), inventory building (i.e. freshness) and FFP expiration (i.e. waste). A case study of one of Denmark's largest grocery wholesalers was used to identify the asymmetrical impact of over-/under-forecasting for 17 FFPs, followed by a simulation to investigate the effect of using the proposed measure. Findings show that including the shelf-life and the asymmetrical impact of over-forecasting with/without price reduction gives marginally lower fill-rate but an improved freshness of FFPs and a lower inventory level. This study adds to current literature on forecast accuracy measures by focusing on forecasts used for inventory control of short shelf-life FFPs, where ensuring a high level of freshness and a low level of waste is critical. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Asymmetric loss; Food waste; Forecasting accuracy; Perishable products; Shelf-life","Food products; Forecasting; Inventory control; Denmark; Fill rate; Forecast accuracy; Forecasting accuracy; Inventory building; Inventory levels; Price reductions; Shelf life; Food preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098583001

In this article, we study the role of user-based innovations in increasing the acceptance and adoption of niche technologies such as vehicle-to-grid. To do so, we connect three interrelated concepts—tinkering, testing and tacit knowledge—and then theorize how they interact in three theories—diffusion of innovation, social construction of technology, and the multi-level perspective. Drawing from a rich set of original data, we then apply the theorization of user-based innovation to the adoption of vehicle-to-grid in the Nordic region, by focusing on how users can influence an emerging state-of-the-art innovation, vehicle-to-X. We find that the three concepts of tinkering, testing, and tacit knowledge should be encouraged in order to accelerate and stabilize the adoption of vehicle-to-grid.

In this work, magnetic illite clay-composite material (Fe3O4@illite) was synthesized via the coprecipitation method by loading Fe3O4 nanoparticles (nano-Fe3O4) onto the surfaces of illite clay. Results from different characterizations showed that nano-Fe3O4 was embedded into illite clay nanosheets and existed on the surfaces of illite clay, thereby reducing the degree of agglomeration and improving dispersibility. The catalytic BPA degradation of Fe3O4@illite and nano-Fe3O4 confirmed the superior performance of Fe3O4@illite compared with that of nano-Fe3O4. The optimum operating parameters for degradation were 0.3 mL of H2O2 at pH of 3 in the presence of Fe3O4@illite, which provided a maximum degradation capacity up to 816, 364, 113, and 68 mg/g for epoxy BPA concentration of resin wastewater (266 mg/L), synthetic wastewater (80 mg/L), Hefei City swan lake (25 mg/L), and Hefei University lake wastewater (14.94 mg/L), respectively, in 180 min reaction time. The degradation data conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The degradation pathways and mineralization study revealed that the adsorption-Fenton-like reaction was the principal mechanism that demonstrated 100% degradation efficiency of Fe3O4@illite even after nine successive runs. The regeneration and reusability tendency analysis ensured that Fe3O4@illite can be easily separated by using magnets. Therefore, Fe3O4@illite composite with H2O2 Fenton-like technology was a promising method for BPA degradation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bisphenol A; Fe3O4@illite; Fenton-like reaction; Illite clay; Nano-Fe3O4","Degradation; Iron oxides; Lakes; Nanomagnetics; Oxidation; Phenols; Reusability; Synthesis (chemical); Water pollution; Water treatment; Coprecipitation method; Degradation capacity; Degradation efficiency; Degree of agglomeration; Fenton-like reactions; Pseudo-first order kinetic model; Regeneration and reusability; Synthetic waste water; Magnetite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096380046

Therefore, the need for developing ESMs, which are realistic but also solvable with acceptable computational resources without losing output accuracy, arises. The purpose of this study is to propose a statistical approach to investigate asynchronous extreme events for different regions and then assess their ability to keep the output accuracy at the level of the full-resolution case. Design/methodology/approach: To extract the extreme events from the residual demands, the paper focuses on analyzing the tail of the residual demand distributions by using statistical approaches. The extreme events then are implemented in an ESM to assess the effect of them in protecting the accuracy of the output compared with the full-resolution output. Findings: The results show that extreme-high and fluctuation events are the most important events to be included in data input to maintain the flexibility output of the model when reducing the resolution. By including these events into the reduced data input, the output's accuracy reaches the level of 99.1% compared to full resolution case, while reducing the execution time by 20 times. Originality/value: Moreover, including extreme-fluctuation along with extreme-high in the reduced data input helps the ESM to avoid misleading investment in conventional and low-efficient generators. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asynchronous extreme events; Clustering; Energy system model; Flexibility; Fluctuation; Multi-regional ESM; PERSEUS; Residual load; Statistic","Electric power transmission networks; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Computational resources; Design/methodology/approach; Full resolutions; Model complexity; Regional energy systems; Residual demand; Statistical approach; Variable renewable energies; Data reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084412299

We point to the importance of data-driven innovation based on digital platforms, as their footprints are growing rapidly and in sync with the shift from analogue to digital innovation workflows. This book offers companies insights on paths to business success and tools that will help them find the right route through the various options when it comes to the digital platforms where innovations may be discovered and from which value may be appropriated. The world hungers for growth and one of the most important vehicles for growth is innovation.

Following recent studies investigating professional work and moral agency, the article engages with Terence Halliday’s famous distinction between science-based and normative professions. Contrary to this argument, the article argues that the practice of engineers, the clearest example of the so-called ‘science-based’ profession, is fraught with moral questions and practices. By drawing on French pragmatic sociology, the article conceptualizes the different ways engineers and others work in situations of uncertainty as different modes of trying. In these modes, professionals rely on different moral principles and ideas for evaluating and judging the professional solutions. As such, the article contributes to the sociology of professions by suggesting a new analytical frame for analyzing moral work as fundamental to professional practice in situations of uncertainty. Empirically, the article builds on fieldwork observations and interviews with professionals from an ongoing research project on Danish climate adaptation in cities and urban rainwater management.

We identify two main challenges of gravitation and alignment, and develop a framework aimed at asking the questions necessary for increasing awareness about inherent business challenges, and how to overcome them at the intersection between corporate and innovation strategy work. © 2021 Carleton University.

In the four decades of design research that followed, the article became a classic. In the article's revaluation of the role subjectivity plays in design, Darke posits a construct called the “the primary generator”—a limited set of (typically subjective) constraints—as a way for architects to engage with design tasks characterized by complexity. The primary generator acts as a random starting point, located within a subset of constraints, which is iteratively adjusted as the design process takes place. It may be construed as a subjectively valued organizing principle driving the design process. It may also be read as either a liberating force of subjective creative freedom, or as a subjective source of bias and fixation that the architect may be unwilling or unable to later escape. Darke herself held both these positions over time. Her ideas on the malleability of the design space and the very initiation of the creative design process by imposition of constraints have been critical in the evolution of constraint research, which represents a rich strand of interdisciplinary design research. © 2021 The Author(s)","Architecture; Constraints; Design process; Prestructuring; Primary Generator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104289712

Three constructs characterize the framework: the digitalization of the local implementation environment; the relative novelty of a given payment technology solution in a country at a specific point in time; and the development status of the national infrastructure. The framework is motivated by a need to support cross-country research in this domain. We analyze eight country mini-cases based on an eight-facet (2 × 2 × 2) classification. A key insight is the distinction between local and national environments for solution implementations, and that there are no objective “low-tech” or “high-tech” payment solutions, but only those that must be calibrated by a country's experience at the national or local implementation environment levels. Our analysis also revealed that implementing cashless payment solutions is complex, with each country and local context having its own set of challenges. Our proposed framework is a basis for policy-makers and payment service providers to developing insights related to the challenges of cashless payment solution implementation. Developing countries sometimes are able to leapfrog their legacy infrastructures by using mobile payment solutions, while developed countries need to appreciate the importance of barriers to implementation success, such as costs, settlement delays, and the habitual use of cash. We further note why business leaders should consider their approaches to payment solutions in view of the different degrees of local digitalization and national infrastructure development to support tech innovations in the digital economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cashless payments; Classification; Country facets; Developing and developed countries; Implementation environment digitalization; Mini-case assessment; National infrastructure development; Payment technology solutions; Point-of-sale (PoS); Technology solution novelty","Computer science; Electronic commerce; Marketing; Business leaders; Classification framework; Developed countries; Development status; Implementation success; National infrastructure; Service provider; Technology solutions; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102406744

In choosing when to sell, startups face a trade-off. Early acquisition reduces execution errors, but later acquisition both improves the likelihood of finding a better match and benefits from increased buyer competition. Startups’ exit strategies vary considerably: Some startups aim to sell early; others remain in stealth mode by developing the invention for a late sale. We develop an analytical model to study the timing of the exit strategy. We find that startups with more capable founding teams commit to a late exit, whereas those with less capable founding teams commit to an early exit. Finally, startups with founding teams of intermediate capabilities remain flexible: They seek early offers but eventually sell late. If trying the early market is so costly that startups have to make a mutually exclusive choice between an early and late sale, startups sell inefficiently late. Instead, if they can collect early offers at no cost before deciding on the timing of sale, there are too many early acquisitions.

Plant closures adversely affect societal entities beyond the specific plant being shut down, such as the parent company and the local community. Motivated by an aluminum producer, we study if mitigating these hardto-assess broader impacts of a shutdown is financially viable using the plant s operating flexibility. Academic/practical relevance: Our social commerce perspective toward managing shutdown decisions deviates from the commonly used asset value maximization objective in merchant operations. Identifying operating policies that delay or decrease the likelihood of a shutdown without incurring a significant asset value loss supports socially responsible plant shutdown decisions. Methodology:We formulate a constrained Markov decision process to manage shutdown decisions and limit the probability of future plant closures. We provide theoretical support for approximating this intractable model using unconstrained stochastic dynamic programs with modified shutdown costs and explore two classes of operating policies. Our first policy leverages anticipated regret theory, and the second policy generalizes, using machine learning, production-margin heuristics used in practice. We compute the former and latter policies using a least squares Monte Carlo method and combining this method with binary classification, respectively. Results: Anticipated-regret policies possess desirable asymptotic properties absent in classificationbased policies. On instances created using real data, anticipated-regret and classificationbased policies outperform practice-based production-margin strategies. Significant reductions in shutdown probability and delays in plant closures are possible while incurring small asset value losses. Managerial implications: A plant s operating flexibility provides an effective lever to balance the social objective to reduce closures and the financial goal to maximize asset value. Adhering to both objectives requires combining short-Term commitments with external stakeholders to avoid shutdown with longer-Term internal efforts to reduce the probability of plant closures. © 2021 INFORMS Inst.for Operations Res.and the Management Sciences.

However, survival rates at the cohort level are changing, raising the question what is the scope of annuities in the presence of aggregate mortality risk? In an overlapping generations setting, we show that risk free annuities exist, but offer a return below the (fair) certainty equivalent return, and agents do not fully annuitize their savings. Higher aggregate mortality risk increases savings and thus the mean level of the capital stock. This lowers the mean rate of return on capital, the survival premium on annuities and the share of individual savings in annuities. © 2020 American Risk and Insurance Association","aggregate mortality risk; annuitization; annuity markets; dynamic efficiency; overlapping generations models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100793458

It develops a three-layer framework comprised of: (1) conceptualization of B2B market segmentation, (2) segmentation as a process, and (3) context. The authors use the framework to evaluate scholarly efforts during the 1986–2019 period and propose a broader view on segmentation as a continuous process. Marketers can benefit from the study by adopting four activities for segmenting markets: (1) pre-segmentation, (2) segmentation, (3) implementation, and (4) evaluation.

Furthermore, this study investigates the moderating role of in-group collectivism as a personal contextual factor. Results from a survey of 676 individuals from five Danish multinational organizations showed a negative association between workplace mobility (e.g. working from home) and the perception of work group knowledge utilization. Positive associations, however, were found between distributed work (using technology) and both work group knowledge location and knowledge utilization. Furthermore, findings suggest that for work group members originating from countries considered to have a high level of in-group collectivism, the positive effect of distributed work on perceived work group knowledge utilization was less pronounced. This indicates that both the virtual work context and personal context need to be taken into account when assessing the effect of virtuality on group behavior.

The point of departure is for consumer researchers to get beyond and avoid the lure of much of the standard evolutionary Neo-Darwinist theorizing with its focus on a sharp division between innate and acquired features and adaptationism as the driving logic. Instead, consumer culture theory can – and should – find inspiration in open systems approaches to human biology and culture, in biosemiotics, and in current movements toward a post-anthropocentric anthropology that reinserts the human as a “becoming” element in a dynamic natural unfolding. Finally, it is argued that such a renewed dialogue is pivotal in the establishment of an ecological wisdom for addressing contemporary issues of climate change and sustainability. © l’Association Française du Marketing, 2021.","anthropocentrism; biology; consumer culture; culture; nature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099297040

Each identified knot consists of two paradoxes and shows how managers involved in one element of a knotted paradox are also likely to be involved in the tensions of the other. The article contributes to a better understanding of the complexity and interrelatedness of select management paradoxes by demonstrating that paradoxes appear knotted in practice.

Yet, with an increasing focus on rationality, objectivity, and science, marketing has arguably become more empathy-deprived. This is unfortunate, as the increasing objectification, specialization, and the resultant distancing and fragmentation of the marketing field make it proportionally essential to emphasize an empathetic approach to marketing. Here, I address this gap by (re)introducing an empathetic approach to marketing entitled empathy-based marketing. Empathy-based marketing addresses the increasing customer-distancing and subdivision of the field of marketing, by focusing on an empathetic core, stimulating cross-fertilization, and accentuating the general well-being of the field.

Drawing on socio-analytic theory, in three samples (Ns = 79, 125, and 119), we investigated whether employees’ perceptions of manager trustworthiness mediated the relation between manager trait narcissism and employee silence, and whether this mediation was moderated by a social skill, apparent sincerity. We found that the three samples largely supported our research model. Manager narcissism lowered employees’ perceptions of manager trustworthiness, which were in turn related to increased employee silence. Whereas the effect of narcissism on trustworthiness perceptions and, indirectly, on employee silence were stronger for managers lower in apparent sincerity, these effects of narcissism were absent for managers high in apparent sincerity. Practitioner points: Perceptions of manager trustworthiness are a key relational process in dyadic, leader–follower relationships; for example, as our studies show, low trustworthiness predicts employee silence about important issues that may be hampering work/organizational functioning. Furthermore, our studies show that manager trait narcissism drives employees’ perceptions of their manager’s trustworthiness, and indirectly, employee silence. The findings highlight the downsides of manager narcissism in dyadic relationships with employees, which prompts guarding against hiring and promoting individuals who are high in trait narcissism to management positions. Moreover, we find that high narcissism managers who seek to appear sincere, may be successful at mitigating the impact of their narcissism on trustworthiness and silence. The findings lead us to recommend managers to improve their sincerity impression management skills – not doing so may be particularly detrimental among those who are more narcissistic. © 2021 British Psychological Society","apparent sincerity; employee silence; manager narcissism; manager trustworthiness; socio-analytic theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099056552

In this way, a large number of retired electric vehicle batteries (REVB) will be produced in a short time and cause new environmental pollution if REVB are not treated properly. To address this problem, one of the major solutions is to realize the echelon utilization of REVB based on the requirements of different application scenarios. Therefore, this study investigates the economic benefits of REVB participating in different Danish electricity markets. The objective function maximizes the profit in the different markets with considering REVB life loss cost in the operational process. Rainflow counting method is employed to accurately estimate the REVB life loss cost, leading to a strong nonlinearity of the optimization problem. Afterward, simulated annealing based particle swarm optimization (SAPSO) method is used to solve the nonlinear problem and find the optimal operational strategies of the REVB. Finally, a case study with considering different situations is provided to analyze the economic benefits of applying REVB in different markets. The results reveal: 1) SAPSO method performs best in finding the optimal results compared with particle swarm optimization and simulated annealing methods, and 2) It is more likely and beneficial to invest in REVB to participate in the regulation market than the day-ahead market. This significance of the study can be summarized as: 1) Theoretically, apart from proposing a simple, cheap and eco-friendly green strategy, i.e., the echelon utilization of REVB in Danish electricity market, we advance the knowledge and call for attention about under which conditions that performing a green strategy can allow environmental-economic benefits simultaneously achievable. 2) The study provides new business opportunities for energy storage and new energy industries, and can help to realize sustainable development to improve people's life and environmental quality. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Economic benefit; Electricity market; Rainflow counting method; Retired electric vehicle batteries; Simulated annealing based particle swarm optimization","Battery electric vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric energy storage; Investments; Lithium-ion batteries; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Power markets; Simulated annealing; Sustainable development; Business opportunities; Electric vehicle batteries; Environmental economics; Environmental pollutions; New energy industries; Operational strategies; Rain flow counting method; Simulated annealing method; Automotive batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097913846

The latest revision of ISO14001 in 2015 provides opportunities to align and manage strategic initiatives in organizations, such as employing a lifecycle perspective, circular economy strategies, and stakeholder interactions that go beyond operational optimizations. To date, this is limited in Danish organizations, where the focus of EMS is on optimizing production processes (resource and energy savings). Simultaneously, Danish organizations are pursuing circular economy through new product designs, business models, etc., without having integrated these initiatives into their EMS. In this paper, the opportunities for integrating circular economy initiatives in EMS based on ISO14001:2015 are highlighted through a mixed-method, three-step research strategy: 1) mapping the status of ISO14001 in Danish companies through qualitative interviews and a national survey, 2) developing potential circular EMS policies and objectives, and 3) interviewing focus groups to explore the potential for circular economy initiatives in EMS. Based on a review of the ISO14001 standard, the potential for integrating and aligning with circular economy was established, and the focus group interviews enriched this potential. The focus group companies all work with EMS and circular economy; however, they have not yet integrated both. These companies can see the benefits of having a systematic and dynamic strategy towards circular economy, and they can see the benefits of broadening the scope of EMS. Expanding EMS to encompass circular principles requires a broader scope of the system to include products, services, business model designs, and partnerships. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Circular environmental management; Environmental management system (EMS); ISO14001","Energy conservation; Life cycle; Business model designs; Continuous improvements; Environmental aspects; Environmental management system (eMS); ISO-14001 standard; Operational optimization; Qualitative interviews; Strategic initiative; Environmental management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097722190

These environmentally competitive conditions have led companies to emphasize green practices in their daily operations, and a critical aspect of environmental operations involves the selection of circular suppliers for collaboration. In this paper, a novel approach is developed by integrating multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and fuzzy inference system (FIS) to evaluate and rank the suppliers towards the transition in the circular supply chain. In the proposed approach, the weights of sub-criteria are determined based on the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method and, then, the score of each supplier in terms of each criterion is calculated by the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution (FTOPSIS). At the end, the final score of the suppliers is calculated and the suppliers are ranked using a FIS. Since each method of the above-mentioned suffers some drawbacks in addition to its unique advantages, this study attempts to overcome these disadvantages through the integration of these methods for the first time. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good Health, and Wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean Water and Sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13). In this way, a practical approach will be proposed for ranking suppliers in the circular supply chain. This approach was applied to an Iranian petrochemical company with six suppliers involved. The performance of proposed approach is validated through comparing it with two other methods by using the Spearman rank correlation coefflcient. The results, obtained through comparisons and experts’ opinions, show that the proposed approach is efficient and applicable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Analytic hierarchy process; Circular supplier selection; Circular supply chain; Fuzzy inference system; Fuzzy theory; Sustainable development goals (SDG's); TOPSIS","Decision making; Fuzzy inference; Petrochemicals; Planning; Supply chains; Environmental issues; Environmental operations; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy inference systems; Multi-criteria decision making; Petrochemical company; Petrochemical industry; Spearman rank correlation; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097716506

Greenland has home rule, but is still part of the Kingdom of Denmark and is subject to Danish defence policy and the police force. With Bhabha’s notion of mimicry, we explore how police officers, through performing ‘Danish’ (Western) culture and professionalism, both confirm and resist colonial stereotypes and even open up pathways towards hybridity. Building on the officers’ experiences, we introduce the term ‘hybrid inclusion’ by which we emphasise two interrelated dimensions necessary for advancing critical inclusion studies: first, a certain understanding of the to-be-included subject as fluid, emergent and thus ontologically singular but at the same time relationally embedded in a collective colonial past and present; second, organisational practices for inclusivity that address and work with the actual impossibility of a ‘happy inclusion story’, free of contradictions and conflicts. © The Author(s) 2020.","Exclusion; Greenland; Homi Bhabha; hybridity; inclusion; mimicry; postcolonial theory; stereotype",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097609646

However, studies implicitly assume that solvers always imitate superior solutions, an assumption that lacks empirical grounding. We propose a simple derivation of an existing simulation framework by incorporating a known cognitive bias (‘IKEA effect’), whereby individuals are assumed to prioritize individual information. This effect allows inefficiencies to be embodied at the individual microlevel, reducing the need for inefficiencies at the structural macrolevel. Simulation results explain discrepancies in previous results, illustrating how more realistic microlevel assumptions substantially impact macrolevel outcomes. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agent-based model; behavioural strategy; exploration and exploitation; NK models; social networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096939077

The following study was a data-based assessment of the water footprint of national consumption of agricultural products in Denmark between 2009 and 2013 in relation to three diet scenarios: The EAT diet, the Insects_REF diet, and the Insects_EAT diet. The EAT diet is a diet that follows the dietary recommendations of the EAT-Lancet Commission on food, planet, and health. The Insects_REF diet is a diet identical to the Danish diet but having all meat replaced by insects. The Insects_EAT diet is a diet identical to the EAT diet but having all meat replaced by insects. The study found that the Danish consumption compared to the EAT diet of meat, sugar, and other animal products is high whereas the consumption of pulses, nuts, oil crops and cereal products needs to be increased. The three diet scenarios result in a reduction of −26% or −682 l/cap/d for the EAT diet, −4% or −112 l/cap/d for the Insects_REF diet, and −24% or −646 l/cap/d for the Insects_EAT diet of the total water footprint with respect to the Danish diet (2651 l/cap/d).

This paper introduces sectorial business model patterns to support manufacturing companies to reduce complexity and uncertainty within circular economy business model innovation. Based on a multidimensional scaling analysis of more than 180 cases of companies that implemented circular economy business models, a number of sectorial patterns were consolidated for six selected sectors. The patterns prescribe a combination of business models configuration options and architectures for tackling specific sources of structural waste. Testing with manufacturing companies revealed the potential of the sectorial patterns to support: (1) visualisation of viability and feasibility of circular economy business models, which strengthens motivation and arguments for their implementation; and (2) reduction of uncertainties and complexity, which facilitates the exploration of business models with higher impact for circular economy.

The integrated framework and hypotheses are tested using unique, multisource (survey and objective archival) longitudinal panel data from 71 young firms covering a seven-year period. As anticipated, the findings show that both financial and human resource slack are negatively related to young firms’ sales growth over time and that financial resource slack variability exerts a positive impact and human resource slack variability exerts a (nonsignificant) negative impact. The results also confirm the importance of value-based selling as a guiding mechanism that significantly alters the effects of both types of resource slack and their variability over time. While value-based selling can help a young firm use slack to grow more effectively, it also has a dark side in that it can stand in the way of risk taking. © 2020, The Author(s).","Entrepreneurship; Longitudinal panel data; Resource slack; Value-based selling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095445018

Knowledge about shelter camping is scarce, and this currently limits the possibilities for well-informed developments within this field. In response to this, the present study aims to identify key motives in shelter camping, and to examine how these motives differ according to group composition and past experiences with outdoor recreation activities. A survey completed by 719 recreational shelter users form the analytical basis for this study. Principal Component Analysis with subsequent reliability testing were carried out to examine whether the 14 motivational items could be reduced to a smaller set of factors describing different motivational aspects among shelter campers. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to reveal variations in motives across user groups and according to experience levels. Shelter users are primarily motivated by experiencing nature and being together as a group, while meeting new people is the least important motive. With the exception of solo users, motives are similar across user groups. Specific experience with shelter camping has impact on the following motives in shelter camping: Experiencing nature, relaxation and tranquility, using equipment and developing skills, and challenge and curiosity. The specific motivational profile of shelter users defines shelter camping as a distinct type of camping and displays the need for shelter camp sites that provide opportunity for experiencing nature together with the group without being disturbed by other users. Management implications: • Shelter users' desire for exclusive social interaction with the group combined with their absent interest in meeting new people indicate a need for shelter sites that provide for some measure of privacy. • Placing shelter campsites in outdoor environments that cater for a sense of remoteness and solitude may support the shelter users desire to experience relaxation and tranquillity. • The fact that motives in shelter camping vary according to experience level, call for managers to consider targeting shelter campsites to less experienced shelter users and more experienced shelter users respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Group composition; Management implications; Motivation; Outdoor recreation; Past experience; Shelter camping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092527340

Toward this end, we focus on the passage of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which mandated public disclosure of patent applications. Theoretically, technology disclosure enables CVCs to better evaluate startups and thus, could increase the likelihood of investment relations. Conversely, such disclosure may already satisfy the technology-acquisition objectives of CVCs, reducing CVCs willingness to form an investment relation after disclosure. Our empirical analysis finds that patent disclosure through AIPA increased the likelihood of receiving CVC investments for startups—specifically in industries where patents have higher information significance. We provide evidence that the observed pattern is mainly driven by a reduction of information constraints regarding startups with patent applications. Managerial Summary: Receiving corporate venture capital (CVC) funding is an important success factor for technology startups. Would disclosure of a startup's innovation increase or decrease its chance of receiving CVC funding? On the one hand, disclosure by startups would reduce uncertainty and search costs for CVC investors, which could increase the chance of CVC funding. On the other hand, such a disclosure would reveal the startups' technology to the corporations, which would in turn reduce corporate incentive to use funding as a window to the startup's technology. Thus, disclosure could also reduce the chance of CVC funding of startups. In this paper, we study the above issue by examining the case of the American Inventor's Protection Act (AIPA), which mandated public disclosure of patent applications. Our results suggest that innovation disclosure significantly improves the likelihood of CVC funding of startups. © 2020 The Authors.

Researchers have widely studied the acceptance of eating insects, but few studies have focused on children's thoughts. The aim of this study is to explore young children's perceptions about eating insects and how this insight might help understanding of ways to increase the willingness to eat insects. Three focus group interviews were conducted with children aged 4–5 years in a public preschool in Sweden. Each focus group consisted of four to five children; in total 13 (eight girls and five boys) participated. In exploring their perceptions of eating insects, the children were balancing between fantasy and reality, and between curiosity and fear, showing many, sometimes contradictory, emotions and relationships to insects as food. The children expressed a clear normative picture of what was considered food, illustrated by ideas about insects being something that are not allowed to eat. They were also concerned about whether the insect was dead before being eaten. Using children's fantasy and curiosity for new things, experimenting with insect-based products and ingredients in well-known dishes and contexts, and discussing different ways of eating them, acceptance of eating insects might increase. © 2020 The Authors.

This threatens to create conflict, as different social groups involved in blockchain development often disagree on which capabilities specific systems should enact. This article adopts a boundary object perspective to make sense of disagreements between collaborating social worlds. We perform a case study of privacy attitudes among collaborating actors in Monero, a cryptocurrency community that emphasises privacy and decentralisation alongside a set of values sometimes described as anti-establishment, crypto-anarchist, and/or cypherpunk. The case study performs a series of interviews with users, developers, cryptographic researchers, corporate architects, and government regulators. Three novel and important findings emerge. The first is that none of the social worlds express a desire to monitor routine transactions, despite the obvious business and tax-collection value of such data. The second is that regulators are happy to postpone active involvement, based on the flawed assumption they can impose privacy-related regulation later, once risks have become clear. Such regulation may not be possible as protocols and rulesets currently being coded into the system may be impossible to amend in the future (unless they can obtain either developer or network consensus). The third is that regulators assume methods for overseeing extraordinary transaction are necessary to avoid widespread, near-effortless money laundering. Yet, each of the other social worlds is operating under the assumption that this trade-off has already been accepted. These findings demonstrate subtle power transitions and changes in privacy attitudes that have implications for research on blockchain, management, and boundary objects in general. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2020.","Blockchain; boundary objects; cryptocurrency; Monero; privacy","Codes (symbols); Economic and social effects; Risk perception; Boundary objects; Decentralisation; Government regulators; Money laundering; OR-networks; Privacy attitudes; Social groups; Trade off; Blockchain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089983871

Frameworks that monetize social value such as social return on investment (SROI) have emerged as a response. The existing literature highlights many benefits and technical challenges of SROI, but largely ignores strategic and organizational learning aspects. This paper explores the use of SROI in an NPO conducting cultural heritage preservation. By analyzing the challenges managers face in agreeing on a reliable (“correct”) computation of SROI and in assessing the validity and relevance (“appropriateness”) of SROI, we seek to understand the challenges and boundaries of SROI. Challenges with a reliable computation of SROI are identifying stakeholders, the choice of proxies, the time horizons, and deadweight factors. Challenges with an appropriate SROI calculation are comparability, subjectivity, legitimacy, and resource utility. We argue that SROI calculations might not be reliable or appropriate in organizations with fuzzy purposes, broad value creation goals, broad target groups, very individual or subjective proxies, strongly lagged outcomes, complex or unobservable causality, and with lack of legitimacy among stakeholders. Organizations should not trustingly adopt SROI without being aware of these limitations. © 2020 The Authors.

Conversely, we argue that logistical performances are as much practical as they are symbolic. Drawing on both CMS and MSD research, we therefore conceptualize consumption logistics as the system of interrelated practices ordering the heterogeneous entities of consumption in space and time. Put differently, by integrating market and consumption practices, consumption logistics recursively (per)form the context of markets, that is, the situated conditions affording subjects the possibility to consume and objects to be consumed within specific markets.

Aligned with work that builds on the notion that an OSS development is tightly interrelated with its social environment (i.e., the OSS community), this study examines the relationship between interproject structure and OSS project success. OSS project success is reflected in two forms: popularity and knowledge creation. Extending the extant OSS literature, we theorize a contingent role of interproject connectedness. In particular, we posit three points: (1) an OSS project with more structural holes achieves higher popularity; (2) an OSS project with fewer structural holes yields higher knowledge creation; and (3) these two relationships are enhanced by an increase in project maturity. Using a dataset longitudinally collected from SourceForge.net, we found that OSS projects with widespread connectedness are more popular. This is especially so for those OSS projects in the mid-mature stage. We also found that OSS projects with a cohesive network achieve higher knowledge creation, irrespective of their maturity. Findings from our study can contribute to OSS literature by identifying OSS projects that are more likely to be successful. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Interproject connectedness; Knowledge creation; Maturity; Open source software; Popularity","Open systems; Interproject connectedness; Knowledge creations; Maturity; Open source software projects; Popularity; Project success; Social environment; Structural holes; Open source software",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079266496

Policy-makers and market operators need a better understanding of the motivations and behavior of prosumers in order to harness their underlying flexibility. In that context, existing market mechanisms must be accompanied by decision-making tools which enable direct participation of prosumers and cooperation among them towards a social choice. This work focuses on designing a community-based market mechanism, in which prosumers can pool their heat and electricity production and consumption, and coordinate their participation in heat and electricity wholesale markets. A central research question that is addressed, is to understand how this mechanism can affect the outcomes of the interactions among individuals towards a social choice, and in particular incentivize cooperation among prosumers. Game-theoretic concepts are used to analyze the properties of the proposed market mechanism with different allocation schemes, namely uniform pricing, Vickrey-Clarke-Groves, Shapley value, and nucleolus. This analysis shows that it is beneficial for the community as a whole to cooperate and that there exists a set of stable allocations for the proposed mechanism. Additionally, although no allocation can satisfy all fundamental desirable market properties, this study demonstrates that the proposed mechanism based on a nucleolus allocation can provide an interesting trade-off between stability, efficiency, and incentive compatibility. Finally, the concepts and properties discussed in this work are illustrated in a case study. © 2019","Community-based market; Game theory; Mechanism design; Multi-carrier energy system","adult; article; electricity; game; heat; human; nucleolus; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078416494

In this reconstruction, particular emphasis is given to the visibility produced by dispositives, through which subjects and object emerge in a particular prescriptive light. Furthermore, analytical privilege is given to relations over substance. This means foregrounding the interrelations between dispositives as well as the dispositive’s ‘internal relationality’, that is, the relations established by each dispositive out of which organizational problems arise and transform. The framework’s potentials are explored in a study of care workers’ responses to a management reform that disciplined and depersonalized care-giving. The difficulties that care workers faced in straddling legal demands, service standardization and care ethics are understood as a situation of heterogeneous dispositions. In this context, care workers and their managers tactically reconstructed their subjectivities, relating to the dispositives in diverse and unexpected ways. © The Author(s) 2019.","care ethics; Deleuze; discipline; dispositive; elderly care; Foucault; law; security",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077140314

However, when wind energy projects encroach on indigenous peoples’ lives and land, there is often a lack of recognition and participation of these peoples and an unequal distribution of cost and benefits of such projects toward them, which leads to opposition against wind energy projects and often triggers conflicts for justice. Worryingly, such conditions have repeatedly resulted in the assassination of human rights defenders, which further inflames the conflict. Herein, I discuss these concepts based on a longitudinal study centered on a wind energy project in Oaxaca, Mexico, with the aim of exploring and understanding the conditions under which wind energy investments fail to respect current laws and norms, as well as the consequences of such negligence. My in-depth analysis of the actions of the government, businesses, and indigenous peoples revealed a phenomenon that is less discussed in environmental (in)justice research: the gradual and continuous transformation of indigenous peoples’ norms and behaviors away from their traditional economic and cultural livelihoods. This phenomenon helps to extend the conceptual understanding of environmental (in)justice with regard to social turbulence, which is defined as the unpredictable behavior of political and social systems in contexts in which existing laws, regulations, and norms regarding environmental justice are not observed. The concept of social turbulence of environmental (in)justice helps to explain how indigenous peoples sacrifice their territories, norms, and traditions to a technical solution to climate change and sustainable development. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Environmental (in)justice; Indigenous peoples; Mexico; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074515199

Automatic and accurate disease lesion segmentation enables fast evaluation of disease severity and assessment of disease progress. In tasks requiring computer vision, deep learning has recently gained tremendous success for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. To test whether we could extract late blight lesions from unstructured field environments based on high-resolution visual field images and deep learning algorithms, we collected ∼500 field RGB images in a set of diverse potato genotypes with different disease severity (0%–70%), resulting in 2100 cropped images. 1600 of these cropped images were used as the dataset for training deep neural networks and 250 cropped images were randomly selected as the validation dataset. Finally, the developed model was tested on the remaining 250 cropped images. The results show that the values for intersection over union (IoU) of the classes background (leaf and soil) and disease lesion in the test dataset were 0.996 and 0.386, respectively. Furthermore, we established a linear relationship (R2=0.655) between manual visual scores of late blight and the number of lesions detected by deep learning at the canopy level. We also showed that imbalance weights of lesion and background classes improved segmentation performance, and that fused masks based on the majority voting of the multiple masks enhanced the correlation with the visual disease scores. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using deep learning algorithms for disease lesion segmentation and severity evaluation based on proximal imagery, which could aid breeding for crop resistance in field environments, and also benefit precision farming. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural networks; Image-based crop phenotyping; Mask fusion; Multi-scale prediction; Plant disease; Resistance breeding; Semantic segmentation","Deep neural networks; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Object detection; Plants (botany); Semantics; Statistical tests; Disease severity; Lesion segmentations; Linear relationships; Phytophthora infestans; Potato genotypes; Precision farming; Segmentation performance; Semantic segmentation; Deep learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099026271

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an online representative cross-sectional study with 380 food consumers. Structural equation modeling served to estimate direct, mediating and moderating effects between the studied constructs and variables. Findings: Examples of moderating and moderated mediating effects include a negative impact of BMI on dietary stress for consumers with low levels of enjoyment value but no significant effect for consumers with high levels of enjoyment. BMI also had a greater negative impact on dietary self-efficacy when the level of respect/achievement was high (vs low), and respect/achievement positively moderated the mediating effect of BMI on dietary stress through dietary self-efficacy. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on analyzing healthy food buying in a particular cultural setting and may suffer from a lack of generalizability to other cultures. The results suggest that research should take into account personal values when investigating stress. Practical implications: Food managers and health authorities can improve their ability to reduce dietary stress when addressing consumers by understanding the role of personal values in healthy food choice and the impact on mental well-being.

This view contrasts with previous studies which predominantly focus on work-related situations. Inspired by Goffman's dramaturgical metaphor, a perspective which emphasizes the influence of social regions on group membership as well as the ritual foundation of everyday social interactions is developed. Design/methodology/approach: This paper’s methodological foundation is a constructivist grounded theory study of 15 undergraduate nursing students' experiences as temporary members during their clinical placements. Findings: Temporary members arrive at their new organization with an expectation of attending non-work-related situations on similar terms as permanent members. However, they do not expect to be treated as new colleagues. They experience being excluded and ignored, which makes them feel humiliated, denied recognition and deprived of their dignity. Originality/value: Illuminating social dynamics related to backstage access provides valuable insights to studies of the relationship between temporary and permanent organizational members. Furthermore, redirecting the analytical focus from social dynamics associated with work-related situations to non-work-related ones provides new perspectives on moral exclusion by emphasizing the ritual foundation and its close connection to moral concepts such as dignity and recognition. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Constructivist grounded theory; Goffman; Moral exclusion; Temporary workers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086882452

Since traditional welfare state systems in Scandinavia are being challenged by new governance systems, new questions are being raised about patient positions and agency, carrying with them potential ethical dilemmas for healthcare professionals. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology of the paper is inspired by critical discourse analysis. Comprehensively analysing the findings of previous discourse studies on how “the patient” is constructed in central policy texts, this study compares the position of the patient in Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Findings: The paper reveals ideological struggles across the Scandinavian countries, operating at a political level, a legislative level and a healthcare level. It is shown that national governance systems still exert hegemonic power by strongly influencing patients' degree of choice and autonomy. The discursive struggle between welfare state governance and other governance systems in Scandinavia indicates a shift towards a commercial healthcare market although a traditional welfare model is advocated by professionals and researchers. Research limitations/implications: Because of the specific conditions of Scandinavian healthcare policy, the findings lack generalisability. The research approach should therefore be explored further in additional contexts. Practical implications: The findings of this study can inform policymakers, professionals and patients of the ideological values underlying seemingly objective shifts in national policy.

Using a Physical Trade Analysis, we show that commercial and virtual water trade grew rapidly moving almost hand-in-hand in the years taken into account: in parallel with a remarkable increase of international trade of avocado from 0.4 Mt in 2000 to 1.9 Mt in 2016, the global virtual water trade of avocado increased from 408 Mm3 to 2238 Mm3 over the same period. The analysis emphasizes a large disparity between developed and developing countries, with the former being net importer of water and the latter large net exporter. In particular, large avocado-related water flows move from countries already under chronic water stress such as Mexico, Peru and Chile towards more water-rich regions such as US, Japan, Canada and the European Union. As a consequence, the overexploitation of water underlying the avocado trade flows may end up worsening environmental conditions in many relatively poor countries in which the export of avocado is often regarded as an important source of economic growth. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Avocado; International trade; Physical trade analysis; Virtual water trade; Water stress","Developing countries; International trade; Chronic water stress; Economic growths; Environmental conditions; European union; Hand in hands; Large disparity; Overexploitation; Virtual water trade; Fruits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095746571

The framework emphasizes a sensitivity to different kinds of actorhood, and how changes are driven by actors’ claims to different forms of authority. After outlining the history of the international tax ecosystem, the framework is applied to present the most important changes to the tax ecology in the last decade.

However, they require high time and effort to collect and analyse process data. As a result, they do not constitute the common practice in the industry and opportunities for increasing the energy efficiency of industrial processes are missed. The paper presents a method, termed the “Energy-Saving Decomposition”, which is based on Process Integration techniques. It is intended for expeditiously outlining and promoting energy efficiency in the industry. Two screening tools, based on mathematical criteria and engineering experience, are employed for reducing the problem dimension before applying conventional design procedures. The first step disregards streams based on their contribution to the overall energy-saving potential, calculated utilising a novel energy-saving decomposition technique. The most promising network is then selected based on its energy-saving potential and size. The second step reduces the problem complexity further, employing economic considerations. This novel method was exemplified by application to a dairy factory: the outcomes and the method itself were compared to conventional Pinch Analysis techniques. The results showed that the developed method can simplify and reduce the time consumption of conventional Process Integration methods significantly, while identifying the most encouraging saving opportunities. The automatic algorithm allowed for reducing the problem size from 62 process streams of the existing plant to 22 streams requiring a computational time of only 135 s. The final retrofit design proposed was the same obtained with conventional Pinch Analysis, achieving a 23% reduction in the plant final energy consumption. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dairy industry; Energy efficiency; Energy-saving decomposition method; Heat exchanger network; Process integration; Retrofit","Energy utilization; Potential energy; Retrofitting; Automatic algorithms; Computational time; Conventional design procedures; Decomposition technique; Economic considerations; Energy saving potential; Industrial processs; Process integration; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096370505

However, a lack of systematic methods for identifying the required measurement points, joint to scarce information on the related benefits, results in reluctance from companies in investing in such systems. The paper presents a method for identifying necessary measurement points in industrial processes. It is applied on four milk powder production plants. It combines Pinch Analysis with uncertainty analysis (Monte Carlo simulations), global sensitivity analysis (standardised regression coefficients) and optimisation procedures to solve the “Factor Fixing” and “Variance Cutting” problems. In this way it identifies a limited number of parameters whose precise and accurate measurement is paramount to meaningfully characterise the plant from an energy perspective. Comparing the results obtained from the four case studies it was possible to infer some general traits of milk powder production processes. In particular, 15 out of 60–66 parameters were identified as generally important, their position in the plant was highlighted and the minimum accuracy level required for their measurement was estimated. Such information could subsequently be used for designing an energy monitoring system and giving proof of its benefits to the involved company, by quantifying them in terms of uncertainty reduction in the outcome of the energy analysis. © 2020","Data acquisition; Energy monitoring; Industrial processes; Process integration; RDRA method; Retrofit","Dairies; Energy management; Monitoring; Monte Carlo methods; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Accurate measurement; Energy monitoring system; Energy perspectives; Global sensitivity analysis; Optimal measurements; Optimisation procedures; Standardised Regression Coefficients; Uncertainty reduction; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094664669

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the impact of the shutdown on Danish citizens' leisure PA throughout different stages of life: 15–18, 19–29, 30–59, and 60+ years. Methods: Between April 3 and 15, 2020, while Denmark was shut down, a survey was distributed through online platforms. Danish citizens (>15 years) could participate in the study, answering questions about their PA behavior before, and during the shutdown. Results: The number of total participants was 1,802; 7.9% teens, 21.5% younger adults, 58.7% adults, and 11.9% older adults. Mean minutes of PA decreased 16.1% from before to during the shutdown. Teens had the largest decrease in PA (36.6%) followed by older (24.9%) and younger adults (21.3%). Low educated (31.5%) and those living in rural areas (30.9%) experienced the largest decrease in PA. Main factors for not doing PA during the shutdown were that they missed what they used to do, lacked social support, and did not have access to the right facilities. Conclusions: During the shutdown, the Danish population struggled even more to comply with national PA guidelines compared with before the shutdown. Although social distancing and shutting down sports facilities are important for preventing the spread of the virus, it can have negative consequences for teens' and younger and older adults' opportunities and motivation for PA, leading to an alarming decrease in PA, and, consequently, will have major public health consequences.

Against this backdrop, we distinguish the agency of organizations and the agency of food and explore their intersection. We argue that the ‘biomateriality’ of food, i.e. its biomaterial qualities, plays a distinctive role in shaping and affecting organizing and organizations. To do so, we present a conceptual framework for analysing food organizing, which highlights the biomateriality of food and its agentic effects on organizational efforts. Thus, we provide researchers with an analytical toolkit to disentangle the different agents (people, organizations, food itself) and the associated processes and mechanisms that play a role in food organizing.

To break down these silos, Industrial Marketing Management introduces a new format of special issues focusing on interdisciplinary research, steered by two new associate editors: Elina Jaakkola and Stefan Markovic. The intention is to publish these interdisciplinary issues on a regular basis, each calling for novel applications of particular topics, concepts, theories, and/or methods from disciplines outside B2B research. The main aim of the interdisciplinary issues is to broaden the scope and potency of B2B research.

We aim to discuss appropriations of these technologies by studying the variety of user motivations and experiences. For that purpose, we conducted a case study of the Norwegian sharing platform “Nabohjelp” designed for use in neighbourhoods. Our data is based on qualitative interviews conducted with Nabohjelp users and representatives of the platform owner and developers, as well as statistics provided by the platform owner. Drawing upon the script theory from science and technology studies, we analyse how people use Nabohjelp and to what extent their use corresponds with the script of the platform owner. Our analysis shows that platform owner inscribed Nabohjelp users as individuals who wish a lower threshold to reach out their neighbours and are conscious about sustainable behaviour. Indeed, the motivations of our informants in using Nabohjelp match these envisioned user profiles. We observe, however, some instances of usages where informants make use of the platform in ways that the designers had not foreseen, thus extending the script of Nabohjelp. Our study also reveals two important issues that play a significant role in shaping user experiences and participation. First, Nabohjelp's payment feature is identified as a barrier that weakens user experiences and undermines participation. The payment feature appears ambiguous to some users, causing confusion about the purpose and the idealistic image of the platform. Second, our results suggest that the neighbourhood context contributes to strengthen trust, one of the core enablers for participation in sharing economy. These results can inform policy makers who intend to adopt digital sharing approaches with the aim to encourage sustainable behaviour in neighbourhoods as well as developers of digital sharing platforms. © 2020 The Author(s)","Motivation; Neighbourhood; Sharing economy; Social participation; Sustainable behaviour; Trust","Motivation; Neighbourhood; Policy makers; Qualitative interviews; Science and technology studies; Sharing platforms; Sustainable behaviours; User motivation; User profile; User experience; economic development; neighborhood; social participation; sustainable development; technological development; technology adoption; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099183844

This article questions this assertion by examining distinct forms of inequity between workers in unionised workplaces and, more specifically, the role of collective bargaining in creating, maintaining, reducing or avoiding them. Based on a study conducted in Australia, Canada (Québec), Denmark and France, the situations of inequity examined are related to employment and working conditions, and favour one group of workers over another group of workers performing the same tasks in the same workplace. To better apprehend these dynamics and distinguish between different situations, we develop an analytical framework to capture them. Then, we focus on one example observable in each country: two examples of inequity based on date of hiring (Canada and Australia) and two based on employment status (France and Denmark), showing how the four ideal-type processes interact in each national context. Based on an analysis of these examples, we demonstrate the segmentation between core and non-core employees, along the lines of segmentation theory, but also within groups of insiders or core employees and the key factors that explain how the collective bargaining process can lead to inequity: time, balance of power, and workplace institutions. © The Author(s) 2021.","Collective bargaining; equity; industrial relations; inequity; international study; segmentation; union",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098977647

Yet something has begun to change in change. In the face of a range of emerging, complex, and interconnected global challenges, society's collective governance efforts may need to be put on a different footing. Many of these challenges derive from emerging technological developments – take Artificial Intelligence (AI), the focus of much contemporary governance scholarship and efforts. AI governance strategies have predominantly oriented themselves towards clear, discrete clusters of pre-defined problems. We argue that such ‘problem-solving’ approaches may be necessary, but are also insufficient in the face of many of the ‘wicked problems’ created or driven by AI. Accordingly, we propose in this paper a complementary framework for grounding long-term governance strategies for complex emerging issues such as AI into a ‘problem-finding’ orientation. We first provide a rationale by sketching the range of policy problems created by AI, and providing five reasons why problem-solving governance approaches to these challenges fail or fall short. We conversely argue that that creative, ‘problem-finding’ research into these governance challenges is not only warranted scientifically, but will also be critical in the formulation of governance strategies that are effective, meaningful, and resilient over the long-term. We accordingly illustrate the relation between and the complementarity of problem-solving and problem-finding research, by articulating a framework that distinguishes between four distinct ‘levels’ of governance: problem-solving research generally approaches AI (governance) issues from a perspective of (Level 0) ‘business-as-usual’ or as (Level 1) ‘governance puzzle-solving’. In contrast, problem-finding approaches emphasize (Level 2) ‘governance Disruptor-Finding’; or (Level 3) ‘Charting Macrostrategic Trajectories’. We apply this theoretical framework to contemporary governance debates around AI throughout our analysis to elaborate upon and to better illustrate our framework. We conclude with reflections on nuances, implications, and shortcomings of this long-term governance framework, offering a range of observations on intra-level failure modes, between-level complementarities, within-level path dependencies, and the categorical boundary conditions of governability (‘Governance Goldilocks Zone’). We suggest that this framework can help underpin more holistic approaches for long-term strategy-making across diverse policy domains and contexts, and help cross the bridge between concrete policies on local solutions, and longer-term considerations of path-dependent societal trajectories to avert, or joint visions towards which global communities can or should be rallied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Governance disruptors; Governance goldilocks zone; Governance puzzles; Macrostrategic trajectories & destinations; Problem-finding","artificial intelligence; governance approach; innovation; strategic approach; technological development; trajectory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098890293

Initially, the expansion of the traditional multi-tier theory to a novel extended multi-tier theory is accomplished by considering three factors: any number of upstream SC entities, the direct customer on the downstream entity, and the focal firm. This study has been done with the intention of implementing SP for the focal firm. Following that, the study develops a research framework to analyse the drivers of SP in an extended multi-tier environment by considering both upstream (1st tier and 2nd tier suppliers) and downstream (direct customer) supply chain entities together with the focal company using multiple theories such as extended multi-tier, triple bottom line (TBL), dynamic capability, institutional theory, and decision theory. Firstly, the relevant SP drivers are categorised (i.e., 7 categories of main drivers and 24 sub-drivers) based on the TBL, dynamic capability, and institutional theory. Secondly, applying the Best Worst Method (BWM), SP drivers were prioritized, and a comparative analysis was performed across the extended multi-tier context. The result shows that the top three priorities of the sub-drivers are “personal values,” “active top management support,” and “government regulation and legislation,” respectively for the focal company. Comparative analysis points to the fact that the sub-driver “government regulation and legislation” is considered important for all the SC entities; however, no mandatory government regulation currently exists to implement SP in the private sector context. On the other hand, the sub-driver “customer pressure / demand” for the sustainable products has been a low priority for the focal company and 2nd tier suppliers and it has not been considered relevant for the 1st tier supplier and direct customer. Thirdly, applying the Decision-Making Trial And Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), an interrelationship analysis was performed on the key SP drivers that exist from the focal company's perspective. Finally, relevant managerial implications and conclusions were drawn for the focal case company based on the results of the prioritization and interrelationship analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Abductive; Drivers; Dynamic capability; Extended Multi-tier theory; Institutional theory; Multiple case study, BWM, DEMATEL, Danish Context; Sustainable Procurement","comparative study; institutional framework; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal; transportation development; transportation planning; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097709201

Moreover, the interaction between the HPP and demand response providers (DRPs) through the intraday demand response exchange (IDREX) market is incorporated into the proposed model. The existing uncertainties such as DA, intraday, imbalance prices, along with renewable energy and IDREX market, are tackled via a hybrid stochastic-interval approach. The suggested structure is not only capable of handling both stochastic and interval uncertainties but also can manage the risk associated with both uncertainty characterization methods. To this end, the proposed risk-constrained offering and bidding model turns into a tri-objective optimization problem in which the normal boundary intersection (NBI) procedure is applied for its solution.

This research is based on a new hybrid method developed by the authors, called Advanced, Reasoned and Organised (ARO) literature review, which improves the quality of literature reviews by integrating the systematic review for quantitative papers, the meta-synthesis for qualitative research and the critical interpretative analysis. Forty-eight articles were included in the literature review. Bibliometric and cluster analyses were carried out. Two hypotheses were applied as filters in the interpretative synthesis of the content and guided the analysis to answer two research questions. The findings underline that RM in SMEs is still a ‘spot’ subject as they put little effort into the risk identification, assessment and monitoring. The lack of procedures and strategies is due to the lack of risk mindfulness and knowledge, and it is related to the managers’ and owners’ risk attitudes. It is fundamental to understand why risk procedures are not implemented and to find a way to raise awareness of the potential benefits of risk and control measures.

There is lack of research that on how particular organizational capabilities are seen more useful and how it influences on green innovation performance. To address this research gap, we examine a mediation model in which we explore whether a firm's knowledge acquisition capability and investment in environmental management mediate the impact of buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities on green product innovation and green process innovation. On the basis of an analysis of a sample of 239 manufacturing firms, we find that buyer-driven knowledge activities have a greater positive impact on green product innovation than green process innovation. Investment in environmental management fully mediates the relationship between buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities and green process innovation, and knowledge acquisition capability partially mediates the relationship between buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities and green product innovation. The current study provides evidence that internal competencies and the role of buyers in knowledge transfer are critical for explaining the green product innovation and green process innovation. Our results suggest that buyer involvement pushes firms to develop resource acquisition capability to enhance green product innovation. Our results also highlight the importance of investment in environmental management for overcoming the environmental challenges in the manufacturing firms. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","green innovation; green process innovation; investment in environmental management; knowledge acquisition","conceptual framework; environmental management; innovation; integrated approach; investment; knowledge; manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096659014

Channel inefficiencies are observed due to the potential misalignment of the manufacturer's and the retailer's segment targeting strategies. We show that this result in the literature is based on a crucial assumption that the product is comprised of only one attribute, and that one segment's preference structure dominates the other segment's preference structure. In this paper, we generalize the problem by considering a multiple-attribute product line design problem that includes the case of a non-dominating preference structure. Interestingly, we show that channel inefficiencies may become an issue in this non-dominating preference structure only when the market segments are significantly different in the overall part worth across the product attributes. We also show the potential of two important operations management concepts firms can use as an attempt to improve channel efficiency. Contrary to the predominant result in the literature on commonality in the centralized channel, we show that offering commonality in the decentralized channel may actually improve channel efficiency even in the absence of cost saving. Furthermore, firms can benefit from the implementation of decentralized product design where the retailer also takes part in designing product attributes. The overall part worth difference between the two segments appears to have a strong influence on the change in channel profits. These findings give rise to previously unrecognized opportunities for firms to redesign their product lines. © 2020","Commonality; Decentralized product design; Marketing/operations interface; Non-dominating preference structure; Product line design","Efficiency; Manufacture; Sales; Channel efficiency; Distribution channel; Multiple attributes; Operations management; Optimal design; Preference structures; Product attributes; Product line design; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094604170

While the innovation activity itself is well documented, little is known about whether users' ideas and solutions also reach manufacturers' organizations. Recent research indicates that the majority of user discoveries remain limited only to local use and are rarely presented to a wider circle of other users, business angels, or manufacturers. This limitation presents a problem because if manufacturers do not have access to users’ needs, ideas, and solutions, they might fail to recognize essential opportunities for innovation. Therefore, this research studies the question of whether lead userness and expected recognition from manufacturers and peers explain the user's inclination to cooperate with manufacturers. We study cooperation initiated from two different ends: users pro-actively approaching manufacturers with problems and ideas and users participating in manufacturer-hosted innovation workshops. Drawing on lead user theory, we develop hypotheses and test them with two empirical studies with nurses and pharmaceutical technical assistants. The results provide support for the argument that a superior trend position and high expected benefits are strong and reliable predictors for both investigated forms of cooperation. The results on the effect of recognition from the manufacturer and peers are mixed, indicating that expected process benefits are less important. © 2020 The Authors","Cooperation; Front end; Lead user; User innovation; User-manufacturer interaction","Engineering; Business angels; Empirical studies; Innovation activity; Lead users; Process benefits; Recent researches; Research studies; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091476063

Coalitions are formed to create more value (i.e., economizing) and to strengthen competitive positions (i.e., strategizing). Based on a formal coalitional model, we derive several unintuitive results. We show that economizing actions may backfire because creating more value may lead other players to strategize more aggressively, offsetting the additional value creation. Moreover, creating countervailing power—that is, building a coalition against players with significant power such as monopolists—not only allows the coalition to appropriate more value, but may also benefit the powerful trading partner by reducing competition among the coalition members. Coalition-formation can hurt coalitions members by reducing economizing investments. Managerial summary: Managers typically seek competitive advantage either by improving efficiency (by having unique resources, lowering costs, or improving managerial practices) or by trying to obtain stronger bargaining positions against their buyers or suppliers. We show that these two approaches interact in surprising ways. For example, efficiency improvements create more opportunity for profit, but also give trading partners stronger incentives to bargain for a share of that profit. At the same time, small buyers or sellers can band together into clubs or cooperatives to get better deals from a powerful trading partner, thereby restraining competition among themselves. However, large firms can try to prevent such coalitions from forming by pursuing vertical integration of potential coalition members. We explore a variety of bargaining situations and show that the ability to encourage or thwart coalition formation is an important managerial tool. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","bargaining; cooperative games; economizing; strategizing; transaction costs","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Efficiency; Profitability; Coalition formations; Competitive advantage; Competitive position; Countervailing power; Efficiency improvement; Improving efficiency; Managerial practices; Vertical integration; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090947265

We demonstrate how empathic engagement by institutional entrepreneurs can nurture communities of practice that co-create change in institutional fields. Our argument hinges on the actors’ affective investment and advances the less developed non-cognitive dimension of institutional work. By integrating empathic engagement into institutional entrepreneurship, we demonstrate how institutional entrepreneurs nurture their ability to engage and cooperate with others to diffuse particular values through institutional work. This integration focuses on the way of knowing generated through empathic engagement: the ability to bring about a consensus by creating frames of reference and identities that others are enchanted by and subscribe to, as opposed to using coercive mechanisms. © 2020 ESCP-EAP European School of Management","Affective dimension; CSR; Empathic engagement; Institutional entrepreneur; Institutional work; Reflective purposefulness; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090703930

Prior research has not explored how decisions about whether to continue search (vs. stop search or satisfice) and where to search (near vs. far) are interrelated. We report laboratory experiment results on how individuals decide whether and where to search in a complex, combinatorial task. We find that different feedback variables influence the decision to stop search from decisions regarding how broadly to search. Our results suggest that not accounting for the decision to continue (or stop) searching, separately from breadth of search, can lead to incorrect predictions regarding how feedback influences search behavior. Managerial Abstract: Managers concerned about the performance of their company face two challenges—they have to find out what potential performance is feasible given their business environment and which organizational policies to implement to realize it. We use a stylized laboratory experiment to better understand how feedback from experimentation informs such a learning process. We find that early-stage feedback has a lasting impact on performance aspirations and managerial expectations about feasible performance. Superior early feedback thereby motivates more sustained experimentation with organizational policies. In contrast, more recent feedback guides the extent to which managers are willing to engage in more radical policy adjustments, especially in the latter stages of a learning process. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Inc.","behavioral strategy; exploitation; exploration; satisficing; search","Decision making; Learning systems; Business environments; Complex searches; Exploration and exploitation; Laboratory experiments; Learning process; Organizational policies; Search behavior; Strategic decision making; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090308344

The research is grounded in political economy of state intervention in tourism and draws from social exchange theory to build the theoretical model. The latter incorporates variables such as trust, power, knowledge, and benefits and costs of tourism, which are central to any exchange process between social actors. The model distinguishes and proposes a theoretical relationship between domain specific political trust and generic political trust. The former refers to citizens' trust in local government in the specific context of tourism development while the latter refers to citizens' general level of trust in local government. The model is tested using data collected from residents of the metropolitan area of Naples, Italy. Results suggest that residents’ trust in local government in the specific context of tourism strongly influences their general level of trust, suggesting a spill-over effect of political trust. We demonstrated empirically that political trust in the context of tourism and the general trust in an institution are theoretically distinct concepts. The constructs we used to conceptualize tourism development has distinct influence on the two dimensions of political trust. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Political trust; Sustainable tourism; Tourism development; Tourism impact","conceptual framework; economic impact; ecotourism; local government; metropolitan area; model validation; political economy; social behavior; state-local relations; theoretical study; tourism development; Campania [Italy]; Italy; Naples; Napoli [Campania]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089357253

Standard ownership concepts—mainly derived from agency and incomplete contracting theories—focus on its incentive effects. However, these concepts and theories neglect ownership's role as an instrument to match judgment about resource use and governance with the firm's evolving environment under uncertainty. We develop the concept of ownership competence—the skill with which ownership is used as an instrument to create value—and decompose it into matching competence (what to own), governance competence (how to own), and timing competence (when to own). We describe how property rights of use, appropriation, and transfer relate to the three ownership competences and show how our theory offers a fresh perspective into the role of ownership for value generation. Managerial Summary: Business owners own with different levels of competence, and differences in ownership competence matter for value creation. We argue that ownership competence consists of competence about what to own (matching competence), competence about how to own (governance competence), and competence about when to own (timing competence). We clarify the role played by each of the three competences for value creation. We also show how the importance of ownership competence for value creation alters depending on ownership concentration, life cycle effects, uncertainty of the environment, and the efficiency of resource markets.

We report the results of laddering interviews with purchasing and engineering managers from 32 actual and potential OBC customers.

Specifically, the risk of being held accountable for problems that may occur in an OBC's implementation and operation emerges as an important concern of decision-makers. In contrast to extant research, that highlights how OBCs transfer operational risk from the customer to the supplier firm, our study indicates that customers also perceive elevated levels of individual and organizational risk when making OBC purchase decisions. Against this backdrop, OBC salespeople should address both individual and organizational goals of key decision-makers in the customer firm and focus on building trust in the supplier's ability to realize and operate an OBC. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Laddering; Means-end-chain analysis; Outcome-based contracts; Servitization; Solution selling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087714784

However, despite the fact that innovation projects generally have different attributes (e.g., complexity and uncertainty), most studies on open innovation have only considered firm-level characteristics (e.g., firm size and firm openness) to determine how to manage open innovation successfully. Project-level studies on open innovation management are still scant - There are only a few conceptual and qualitative articles on the topic, and there is a lack of quantitative insights. Based on a survey designed to collect detailed data from 201 innovation projects undertaken by American firms, this article provides a quantitative cross-project analysis of how two, key innovation project attributes (i.e., complexity and uncertainty) are related to five factors for successful open innovation management: 1) openness level, 2) external partner choice, 3) open innovation mechanism choice, 4) collaboration process formalization, and 5) internal firm practices. This exploratory study contributes to the open innovation literature by highlighting the importance of microfoundations (i.e., innovation project attributes) in successful open innovation management. This article concludes by suggesting a number of relevant project-level future research opportunities in the field of open innovation management, and some methodological recommendations on how to address such opportunities. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Open innovation (OI); project attributes; project complexity; project uncertainty; project-level variables","Electrical engineering; Engineering; Collaboration process; Exploratory studies; Innovation projects; Level characteristic; Micro-foundations; Open innovation; Project analysis; Research opportunities; Uncertainty analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086431557

We propose that positioning theory offers a promising tool for understanding teachers’ assumptions about their professional identities and, when used in faculty development programs, can strengthen teachers’ awareness that they can situationally orchestrate pedagogy by purposefully shifting between different positions. Over time, this awareness may help to develop teachers’ situational wisdom. We introduce the concept of “pedagogical positioner” to capture this meta-positioning skill. We further identify three positions that teachers can adopt when teaching first-year students: the content expert, the learning facilitator, and the supportive caregiver. Based on positioning theory, we conceptualize the discursive positions, storylines, and rights and duties that emerge in teachers’ accounts of these shifts. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of reflexive and interactive positioning in teaching, and suggest how awareness about different positions might be fostered through faculty development programs. © The Author(s) 2020.","Faculty development; management education; positioning theory; situational wisdom; teacher identity; teacher positions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086113574

Conducting an in-depth case study of a culinary movement based in Istanbul, Turkey, we identify three forms of ambiguity that enable the construction of a common cultural heritage. These forms include ambiguity of origin, ambiguity of artefacts and ambiguity of ownership, and enable actors to concretise and perform a vaguely defined past in the present.

We theorize and find that investor reactions to taxonomic acquisitions, where synergies are easier to comprehend, are generally more positive than investor reactions to thematic acquisitions, which require higher cognitive processing. We argue that this effect is driven by the cognitive processing of investors, instead of “true” synergy, since the more negative announcement returns for thematic deals reverse a few days after the announcement, converging with the announcement returns of taxonomic deals. Moreover, we find that attempts by the acquiring company to help investors assess thematic acquisitions do not seem to be effective at eliminating this effect and instead appear to aggravate investor suspicion.

Such studies depict creative workers as correspondingly self-enterprising, self-reliant, self-interested and calculative agents who valorise care-free independence. In contrast, we adopt the ‘ethics of care’ approach to explore, recognize and appreciate the communitarian, relational and moral considerations as well as interpersonal connectedness and interdependencies that underpin creative work. Drawing on in-depth interviews with creative workers in a range of marginal socio-cultural contexts, we argue that creative workers cultivate and sustain a diverse array of practices of care arising from an affective concern with the well-being of others. Far from being merely individualistic and crudely competitive actors, creative workers enact practical ethical responsibilities and affectivities towards a range of human and non-human others, including families, local communities and neighbourhoods, colleagues, artistic scenes and their adjacent genres, and surrounding national and linguistic cultures. In emphasizing the fundamental and structuring role of care in contingent labour markets our approach accords with recent trends in the social sciences that ‘affirmatively’—as opposed to ‘negatively’ and ‘suspiciously’—recognize that mutuality, solidarity and affectivity are powerful drivers of action on a par with or even exceeding market-driven self-centredness. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Care; Caring; Compassion; Creative industries; Creative work; Cultural labour; Ethics of care; Informal work; Marginal contexts; Moral work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074695990

The authors discuss the possibility of integrating counter-narratives as a resource in strategy processes. Finally, the usefulness and challenges of the applied narrative approach are addressed. Design/methodology/approach: The study was undertaken as a case study of strategy communication in a private housing association. The empirical material consists of 16 qualitative interviews from all levels of the organization as well as recordings of meetings where management presents a new strategy to the employees. The study adopts a mixed methods interpretivist approach using focus groups and interviews as data and with a focus on narratives as sense-making resources. The applied method of analysis is based on narratology, sociological action analysis and the concept of “framing.” Findings: Employees’ counter-narratives focus on practical problems regarding the implementation of the business strategy. They materialize through temporal structures and framing strategies through which employees’ perspectives are presented indirectly and with great care. In spite of their oppositional content, these counter-perspectives cannot be considered to be resistance; on the contrary, employees take great interest in solving the reported problems. Counter-narratives are seemingly useful resources in a form of “reality check” in the organization, in order to elucidate the implementation of the business strategy and make necessary adjustments. The research furthermore points to a more dialogical strategy communication where employees are involved earlier in the process rather than marginalized to “resistant bystanders.” Originality/value: These findings give insight into the use of narratives as practical meaning construction in an organizational context, and in relation to strategy communication and change. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Change; Conflict; Counter-narrative; Framing; Narrative; Strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049689580

The authors show that the combination of high CEO incentive compensation and CEO overconfidence is associated with an increase in corporate risk of approximately 6% while the individual effects are for all practical reasons negligible. The results imply that only the combination of high CEO incentive compensation and CEO overconfidence is associated with a significantly elevated level of corporate risk.

This paper explores the mobilization of MNE technologies and local actors in the case of Grundfos LIFELINK and deploys an actor-network theory (ANT) translation framework to unravel immersion processes of MNE technologies in local BoP contexts. The study adopts a longitudinal single-case design to analyze the introduction of MNE pump technology, which provides clean water in Kenyan rural villages. The findings show that a lack of understanding of the local BoP context leads to failure in mobilizing relevant actors for the intended water-provision network and, subsequently, to an initial rejection of the technology. By focusing more on the local actors and by mobilizing additional actors, the MNE technology is successfully translated into the BoP context—albeit without the intended creation of MNE value. The paper contributes to the understanding of how MNEs can achieve technology development in BoP contexts, as well as to the evolution of BoP approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","BoP context; MNE; Translation; Value creation","Social sciences computing; Actor network theory; Base of the pyramids; Immersion process; Multinational enterprise; Pump technology; Rural villages; Technology development; Water provision; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096828230

Public procurement can also be a tool to meet horizontal objectives such as environmental or social ones. In this paper, public procurement is highlighted as a tool for the transition to circular economy. However, circular public procurement cannot be confined to just a procurement department as it requires collaboration internally across departments and externally with partners in the supply chain. The current practices within public procurement are explored in the analyses of eight proactive Danish municipalities, with a focus on the development from green to circular public procurement. This research is based on practices and learning theory to understand what actually happens in an organization, in other words, how people work. The difference between practices and policies is noticeable in public procurement, as policies stipulate general guidelines, while the inclusion of green and circular aspects depend on the competences of each individual procurement department. Tools supporting this inclusion are at the center of successfully using public procurement to support environmental concerns, for example, through the application of ecolabels, while the lack of circular public procurement tools presents a barrier for further uptake. In several of the cases explored, green public procurement practices are driven by demand from end-users, while the rather fewer experiences with circular public procurement are project-based and driven by management. From the procurement departments’ point of view, circular procurement is still perceived as “new and difficult,” and the principles of circular procurement are vague. Also, circular public procurement requires competences that are not present in the procurement departments today, and therefore their understanding of circular procurement is restricted to a few well-known cases. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Circular public procurement; Ecolabels; Green public procurement; Procurement practices","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Current practices; Environmental concerns; Learning Theory; Products and services; Project-based; Public organizations; Public procurement; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096165620

Design/methodology/approach: Representative consumer samples in Germany, France, China and Thailand (N ∼ 1,000 per country) completed an online survey on three levels of country image regarding Denmark and attitudes towards buying an organic food product from Denmark. Data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. Findings: The hierarchical country image model fitted the data well in the two European countries, but not in the two Asian countries. It appears that the hierarchical relationships proposed by the model require a high level of familiarity with and knowledge of the origin country and the product type. Research limitations/implications: The application scope of the model is considerably narrower than implied by earlier research. Further research should combine data from a number of sources to investigate the model’s application further. Practical implications: Exporters must pay attention to both the general image of their country and the image of their country with regard to their specific product category, as this impacts consumer product evaluations. Originality/value: International trade and the success of export strategies ultimately depend on consumer acceptance in importing countries. This study demonstrates how consumer perception of imported products is affected by the exporting country’s image, which may be more or less elaborate and differentiated.

The analysis of the viewpoints of the giver and the recipient, reflecting their profiles, leads to recommendations for retailers. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory, small-scale, open-ended questionnaire (48 respondents) produces 43 (38) accounts of surprising gifts given (received), informed further by in-depth interviews (eight informants, both givers and recipients of surprising gifts). Findings: This study identifies and elaborates on the variables (why, when, what, where, who and how, and their combinations) that define surprising gift giving, from both giver and recipient perspectives. The findings indicate a paradox: even if givers or recipients prefer a surprising gift, they might give or wish for an unsurprising gift to avoid disappointment. Research limitations/implications: Further research should confirm the findings using representative samples. Moreover, gender differences in surprising gift giving should be investigated further. Finally, the exact characteristics and properties that make common objects potential candidates for successful surprising gifts should be studied further. Practical implications: The discussion has relevant implications for manufacturers and retailers. For example, if recipients are surprised, happy and satisfied, they likely exhibit higher brand recall. The recipient’s (happy versus not happy) emotions also have spillover effects on the giver’s. Thus, retailers should provide assistance in the store and advertise their salespeople as experts who can offer advice about selecting appropriate gifts. The exact characteristics and properties that make common objects potential candidates for successful surprising gifts should be studied further. Originality/value: The systematic account of all six variables, not previously analyzed in the literature, provides rich insights into surprising gift giving.

This is achieved by illustrating how practice brings together two modes of existence of history in action-that is, how habitus and field dialectically adjust to each other while endowing actors with a “practical sense” that allows them to appropriate history in practice.

To date, the ontology of time sees the present, the past, and the future as different and discrete temporal epochs and thus prevents us from understanding activities as a creative process in which the past, the present, and the future are constantly redefined to give meaning and sense to actors. Conversely, an ontology of temporality enables us to grasp the situated nature of organizational phenomena. We argue that an events-based approach provides a better understanding of how past, present, and future events are constantly co-defined and configured, thereby enabling actors to gain a sense of continuity, i.e. a sense about their history, the present moment, and an expected future. Following a discussion of the nature of an events-based approach, we discuss the contributions and implications of such an approach by showing how it redefines the very subject of organization and brings insights to the study of contemporary organizational phenomena. © Oxford University Press 2020.","Events-based approach; Organization; Process philosophy; Temporality; Time",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108634810

Much valuable research has been done on the concept of project complexity. The research reported in this paper aims to provide a new means (the “Complexity Navigation Window”) and guiding principles for the navigation of project complexity in practice. Design/methodology/approach: This paper applied action design research (a methodology for design science research) to design and evaluate the Complexity Navigation Window (CNW), which will serve as a representation of project complexity as a key component of the user interface for a decision support system (DSS) for managing project complexity. Findings: Formative evaluations of the CNW by 16 project management practitioners indicated that the artefact is relevant, comprehensible and heading in a promising direction to guide decision-making. The evaluation also highlighted project managers' difficulty in using the (conceptual) representation by itself to assess a project's current situation accurately, which in turn limits their ability to understand a project's current complexity and decide an appropriate course of strategy. A conceptual framework by itself is insufficient. This finding motivates further research to develop and evaluate a DSS that would partially automate the assessment process (by surveying stakeholders and automatically assessing and representing project complexity according to the CNW), which should aid in increasing the accuracy (and timeliness) of project complexity assessments and contribute to appropriate strategy formulation and timely revision. Practical implications: The formative evaluation of the CNW indicates relevance for practitioners and the further features of the DSS may still yield even higher perceived utility from the full artefact. Originality/value: The paper provides improved understanding of practitioners' perceptions of project complexity and ability to assess it for a given project. The paper describes the design of a new visualisation for navigating and managing complexity. The paper further presents four strategies for managing project complexity.

Research limitations/implications: Learning from past projects was more problematic and difficult than predicted based on the postproject review literature. The past did purvey multiple interpretations. Practical implications: Learning from the past is not effective if the goal is generating causal knowledge, scoring forms and checklists for future use. Postproject reviews provide an opportunity to decide what the past should be about rather than identifying what it was about. Originality/value: The past might appear stable, but, when examined, ambiguity emerges. Research on knowledge generation from postproject reviews assumes that a project’s past is more or less stable and agreed upon. However, this study addresses the critical role of ambiguity about the past and the challenges when organizations try to learn from history through project reviews and evaluation processes. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Ambiguity; Assessment; Clinical; Evaluation; Experience; Knowledge; Learning; Postproject review; Project review; The ambiguity of experience; The ambiguity of the past",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092571367

This study aims to devise a model delving into critical climate risks and the role of consortia and social capital to mitigate these risks. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was used, including qualitative and quantitative data from small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in an Australian agrifood supply chain (AFSC). Findings: The qualitative analysis uncovers four critical climate risks and a repertoire of relational, structural, and cognitive social capital accrued by SMEs of AFSC through consortia. The quantitative analysis corroborates that the SMEs that accumulate higher social capital through active engagement within consortia are able to respond more effectively to climate risks than to others. The authors, therefore, find that climate risk mitigation in SMEs is the function of both association (consortia) membership and the accrual of higher social capital through active involvement and collaboration within networks. Originality/value: This is the first study in using a moderated-moderation model that simultaneously investigates the business impact of climate risks and how the moderating impact of consortia (a primary moderator) is further moderated by social capital (a secondary moderator) in explaining SMEs performance. The paper addresses the lack of adequate empirical research, particularly mixed-methods, in supply chain risk management literature. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agriculture; Agrifood; Consortia; Food industry; Mixed-methods; SMEs; Social Capital; Supply chain risks; Supply risk; Three-way interaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090191847

These technical challenges obligate power system operators to curtail part of the produced renewable energy at various scheduling intervals. Motivated by these challenges, grid-connected energy hubs are seen as a way forward to boost system flexibility, decrease the rate of renewable power curtailment, and increase energy efficiency. However, simplified models may significantly affect the performance of the grid-connected energy hubs in practice. Hence, this paper proposes a holistic structure to determine the optimal coordinated operation of the grid-connected energy hubs and the regional power system by relying on the high penetration of wind power. In this regard, various fundamental challenges that have not yet been addressed in an integrated manner, including the CO2 emission rate and the amount of curtailed renewable energy along with total operating costs of the integrated energy system, are among the main objectives of the optimization problem. The proposed structure is developed in the form of tractable mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem to handle the day-ahead security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC). The information-gap decision theory (IGDT)-based robust model is used for accurate modeling of wind power uncertainty. The characteristics of the proposed IGDT-based robust SCUC model and its benefits are investigated through several technical case studies conducted on the modified 6-bus and 24-bus test systems. The simulation results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed structure. According to the obtained results for the 6-bus test system, networked energy hubs can help the system operator to reduce the total operating cost, wind power curtailment cost, and CO2 emission cost by 16.62%, 100%, and 30.44%, respectively, through utilizing up-to-date energy conversion facilities and energy storage systems as well as managing energy demands. It can be seen that the proposed strategy is a very effective step towards achieving a 100% renewable energy system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Demand response; Energy hubs; Energy storage systems; Information-gap decision theory (IGDT); Multi-carrier energy systems; Renewable power curtailment","Carbon dioxide; Data storage equipment; Decision theory; Electric power system economics; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Integer programming; Nonlinear programming; Operating costs; Uncertainty analysis; Wind power; 100% renewable energy systems; Energy storage systems; Integrated energy systems; Mixed integer non-linear programming problems; Power system operators; Renewable energy source; Security-constrained unit commitment; Wind power curtailments; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092274748

Industrial symbiosis is in the paper defined as the connection of traditionally separate industries in a collective effort to simultaneously increase competitive advantage and reduce environmental impacts by means of byproduct exchange and shared infrastructure. The paper is based on three components: First, the paper reviews, journal articles to provide a policy landscape overview of how such Industrial symbiosis systems are supported by policies and in which areas new policy needs can be identified. Secondly, the paper reviews and discusses policies and framework conditions, provided by the European Union (EU), the United Nations (UN) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) designed to support the development of Industrial symbiosis systems The analysis distinguishes between direct and indirect policies in order to emphasize that the development of Industrial symbiosis systems is influenced not only by policies directly targeting industrial symbiosis but also by general framework conditions that may not have been designed with Industrials symbiosis in mind. To improve the understanding of such in direct policies the paper thirdly includes a case study from Denmark, Maabjerg Energy Center (MEC). This case provides new insights into the application of Industrial symbiosis concepts, especially with regards to how framework conditions and indirect policies can influence and shape the development of industrial symbiosis systems. Based on these three components, this paper analyses obstacles and drivers for a further dissemination of Industrial symbiosis within the EU, and suggest key points for further assessment and development on a potential way forward. From the literature review and framework conditions assessed, general recommendations are provided whereof many relate to the potential benefits of focusing more on development and re-development of indirect incentive schemes fostering symbiotic behavior in industries as opposed to focusing only on designing policies exclusively based on direct top-down regulations. From the case analysis, several examples of more context-specific drivers and obstacles were highlighted as valuable in the given situation including the potential benefit of more flexible funding schemes, the importance of positive value-based communication to gain political support on the local, regional and national environment, feed-in tariffs and tax reliefs and the relevance of having centralized legal organs with specialized competencies on regional or national level to support development and implementation efforts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Framework conditions; Industrial symbiosis; Maabjerg BioEnergy; Policy review","Competition; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Laws and legislation; By-product exchange; Competitive advantage; Framework conditions; Industrial symbiosis; Literature reviews; Organization for economic co-operation and development; Potential benefits; Shared infrastructure; Economic analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092144738

This study assesses the daily intake of four HMs, i.e. cadmium, mercury, lead and arsenic, and four minerals; chromium, nickel, selenium and zinc. 456 Danish food items were grouped in six food categories (grains, fruits and vegetables, oils and condiments, food rich in fats, sugar and alcohol, milk and dairy and protein-rich). A model of four different Danish diets (standard, carnivore, vegetarian and vegan) is presented. The probability of exceeding the provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) of HMs and minerals for the four different Danish diets were calculated applying a Monte Carlo approach. While the sources to the total intake differ, there is no significant differences in the risk of exceeding the PTDI across the four dietary profiles. The risk of exceeding the PTDI across the four dietary profiles was on average 60%, 17% and 16% for cadmium, mercury and lead respectively. For total arsenic the risk of exceeding the provisional daily intake was 33%. Concerning minerals, the average probability of exceeding the recommended daily intake was 29% for chromium, 80% for selenium, 73% for nickel and 0% for zinc. Regarding the toxic limit value the probability was 12% for chromium, 17% for selenium, 52% for nickel and 0% for zinc. The results of our study emphasize the importance of implementing measures to reduce the risk cycle of HMs threatening environmental health and food safety. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Daily intake; Dietary habits; Food safety; Heavy metals; Soil health; Total exposure","Arsenic; Biochemistry; Cadmium; Chemical contamination; Food supply; Health risks; Minerals; Nickel; Risk assessment; Selenium; Supply chains; Zinc; Environmental health; Fruits and vegetables; Health issues; Monte Carlo approach; Recommended daily intakes; Risk reductions; Tolerable daily intake; Total arsenics; Oils and fats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092057833

From a micro perspective, the dynamic changes in the internal structure of compost aggregates during composting can reflect aeration conditions, which is worthy of further study to improve composting efficiency. This study set three composting treatments (swine manure: rice straw = 4:1 and 8:1, swine manure: rice straw: biochar = 8:1:1, wet mass ratio), to detect 3-D microstructures of compost aggregate with the involvement of humus and biochar during composting. The results showed that biochar addition to compost enhanced humic acid formation and humification degree, and it greatly decreased bulk density by 45.89% and increased free air space by 31.25% compared with the initial stage of the compost. Compost materials tended to become looser during composting, and biochar aided an increase in total porosity of compost aggregates by approximately 90% compared with other treatments, mainly attributed to decomposition effects. It is assumed that large aggregates break up with the assistance of biochar, and these small parts of the materials gradually stick together with the formation of humus colloids to develop final dense particles. Therefore, it can be concluded that when biochar is used as an additive, it can improve the physical structure with the involvement of humus during composting. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregate structure; Biochar; Composting; Humus; SR-μ CT","Aggregates; Agricultural robots; Composting; Fertilizers; Manures; Soils; Aerobic composting; Compost materials; Dense particles; Dynamic changes; Free air spaces; Internal structure; Large aggregates; Physical structures; Waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091979889

Existing and new methods were selected and developed for a study which aimed at obtaining insights into parents’ and young children’s understandings of children’s influence and family interaction with regard to family food consumption practices. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 35 children were interviewed using semi-structured interviews in five kindergartens. Subsequently, 13 families were interviewed in their homes. The latter interviews included the same children as were interviewed in the kindergarten. The methods discussed include drawings, a desert-island-choice task, a sentence completion task, photographs, vignettes and a video-clip. Findings: When interviewing young children about family decision making influence, the use of engaging methods contributes to the quality of data achieved and to the participants’ enjoyment of their participation. Care should be taken not to overload children with exercises. Visual rather than verbal methods worked better for engaging the children in the research process; for parents all included methods worked well. Research limitations/implications: The current study shows that a method developed specifically for the study (desert-island-choice task) was apt at including all family members’ perspectives; future studies should develop methods that capture shared rather than individual experiences. The study was carried out in wealthy areas in Denmark. It would be highly relevant to broaden the sample to other socio-economic and cultural contexts. Originality/value: The study is based on interviews with children usually deemed too young to interview. The contribution is novel methods that allow for studying the interaction between children and parents and that are not based on reading and writing skills to access the perspectives of 5-6-year old children.

The effects of the app in allowing greater demand-side flexibility from household consumers is estimated based on data from an 18-month field trial involving 1557 Austrian households. These estimates are given as hourly price elasticities of electricity demand and hourly energy efficiency treatment effects from consumer engagement with the app. In a novel methodological coupling, the econometric estimates are input into the Balmorel energy system model, which is used to analyze future scenarios of full renewable energy deployment in the Austrian energy system. The results demonstrate that the impact of the flexible residential demand for electricity is small but significant to future system costs. The total discounted system cost increases by 20–24% in the renewable energy scenarios, compared to a business as usual scenario, due to heavy investments in renewable generation. However, system cost is reduced by 4–7% in renewable energy scenarios where the observed demand-side flexibilities are considered. The results are subject to several methodological caveats, but they give a clear signal that ICT-enabled demand side flexibility can be an important cost-saving element that should be integrated into the future energy system and considered in system-level models. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Balmorel; Energy efficiency; Energy system analysis; Flexible demand; Smart meters","Electric power utilization; Energy efficiency; Smartphones; Austrian households; Electricity consumers; Electricity demands; Energy system model; Renewable energies; Renewable energy deployments; Renewable generation; System-level models; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090577617

This has led to a considerable increase in interest among the researchers and academicians working in the domain of social sustainability. This article reviews 129 research papers published in different journals and attempted to identify drivers, issues, barriers, tensions, practices, and performances related to social sustainability in multi-tier supply chains. The prevalent theories and governance mechanisms of social sustainability in multi-tier supply chains have also been presented. The commonly used theories are stakeholder theory, institutional theory, resource based view theory, transaction cost economics theory, grounded theory, and resource dependence theory. It is observed that most of the papers have presented drivers, barriers, issues, and practices in generic ways by conducting exploratory case studies using single case or multiple cases; there is a distinct lack of multi-tier perspectives devoted to the context of emerging economies. The tension, an important aspect of implementation of social sustainability practices, has not been addressed adequately in the extant literature for multi-tier supply chains.

Here we describe a systematic map that catalogues existing research on behaviorally informed interventions targeting changes in consumer food consumption and food waste behavior. The purpose is to gain an overview of research foci and gaps, providing an evidence base for deeper analysis. In terms of food consumption, we focus on animal protein (meat, fish, dairy, and eggs) and its substitutes. The map follows the standards for evidence synthesis from the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) as well as the RepOrting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES). We identified 49 articles including 56 separate studies, as well as 18 literature reviews. We find a variety of study designs with a focus on canteen and restaurant studies as well as a steep increase of publications since 2016. We create an interactive evidence atlas that plots these studies across geographical space. Here, we find a concentration of research in the Anglo-Saxon world. Most studies follow multi-intervention designs and focus on actual food consumption behavior, fewer on food waste behavior. We identify knowledge clusters amenable for a systematic review focusing on the effectiveness of these interventions, namely: priming, disclosure, defaults, social norms, micro-environment changes, and ease of use. The systematic map highlights knowledge gaps, where more primary research is needed and evidence cannot support policy; it identifies knowledge clusters, where sufficient studies exist but there is a lack of clarity over effectiveness, and so full synthesis can be conducted rapidly; finally, it reveals patterns in research methods that can highlight best practices and issues with methodology that can support the improvement of primary evidence production and mitigation of research waste. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study mapping this specific area. © 2020 The Author(s)","Behavioral interventions; Demand-side policy; Food waste; Meat consumption; Nudges; Systematic mapping study","Consumer behavior; Food supply; Food waste; Behavioral interventions; Food consumption; Literature reviews; Microenvironments; Reporting standards; Systematic maps; Systematic Review; Systematic study; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090230559

For this purpose, a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed that adopts best-worst method (BWM) to weight criteria and sub-criteria extracted from literature and applies grey relational analysis (GRA) and VIKOR to rank potential locations. Moreover, an innovative Monte Carlo simulation-based (MCSB) approach is applied to analyze sensitivity of GRA and VIKOR. In this approach, two functional measures of robustness are introduced in order to compare performance of the methods. Based on the obtained results, some criteria, including construction cost (0.125), initial investment (0.166), ecosystem destruction (0.103), solar radiation intensity (0.085), and distance to catchment basins (0.084) have considerable importance because their weight is more than the average amount of global weights (0.0625). Furthermore, Birjand, Sarbisheh, and Khezri are the best locations for establishment of solar sites. Based on the proposed MCSB approach, VIKOR has higher robustness than GRA in the both functional measures. From the perspective of renewable energy development in Iran, the proposed approach can be recommended to be applied in other provinces of Iran for finding the best locations for solar sites. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Monte Carlo simulation; Multi-criteria decision-making; Solar sites; Sustainable evaluation","Catchments; Decision making; Investments; Location; Renewable energy resources; Site selection; Catchment basins; Construction costs; Grey relational analyses (GRA); Multi-criteria decision making; Renewable energy development; Selection problems; Solar radiation intensity; Sustainable evaluations; Monte Carlo methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090050048

The present study aimed to apply bio-augmentation strategy with different lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii or Pediococcus acidilactici) to improve lactic acid production from non-sterile SSOHW. The optimum operational temperature, initial pH and total solid loading during fermentation were essential for lactic acid production. Lactic acid concentration of 20.7 ± 0.3 and 16.8 ± 0.4 g/L were obtained by bio-augmenting Pediococcus acidilactici and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, respectively, achieving an increment of 36.2% and 10.5% compared to abiotic augmentation. A lactic acid yield of 0.73 g/g-sugar was achieved with addition of Pediococcus acidilactici, while the optical purity of LA was also improved by the bio-augmentation. Furthermore, response surface methodology along with the Box-Behnken model was applied to determine the optimal operational conditions (i.e. temperature, initial pH and total solid loading). Based on the outcome, the highest concentration and yield were 31.2 g/L and 0.735 g/g-sugar at temperature of 32.4 °C, initial pH of 8.0 and total solid loading of 105.0 g/L. Finally, the predicted value was validated by scale-up experiment, and the LA titer and yield of scale-up fermenter were well corresponding to predicted value. The bio-augmentation strategy and process optimization provided a simple and energy saving method for industrial LA production from SSHOW. With respect to environmental sustainability and cleaner production, the conversion of bio-waste to lactic acid is an advantageous waste management approach that will contribute to the transition from a petro-based economy towards the production and use of bio-based derived products thereby creating innovative value chains with lower carbon footprint and social responsibility. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-augmentation; Lactic acid; Lactobacillus delbrueckii; Pediococcus acidilactici; Source-sorted organic household waste","Carbon footprint; Energy conservation; Lactic acid; Optimization; Pollution control; Sugar industry; Sustainable development; Waste management; Environmental sustainability; Lactic acid production; Lactobacillus delbrueckii; Operational temperature; Organic household wastes; Pediococcus acidilactici; Response surface methodology; Social responsibilities; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089943916

Design/methodology/approach: The paper utilizes exploratory historical methods and examines cross-sector partnerships from three key emerging markets – Pakistan, Turkey and Nigeria. The context of the emerging markets is important given the institutional fragility such markets encountered. Findings: The authors offer a conceptual discussion that explicates the vital role of such partnerships in global emergencies. The authors also highlight the instrumental role of adaptive learning in cross-sector partnerships, which can help multiple stakeholders create and deliver value in response to an emergency like a global health pandemic caused by the COVID-19. Along with the conceptual discussion, the authors further offer practical examples of cross-sector partnerships in emerging economies of Pakistan, Turkey, and Nigeria – undertaken in response to the recent pandemic – emphasizing that such partnerships are crucial to mitigate the emergencies and their consequences on society. Finally, this paper offers theoretical and practical implications for cross-sector collaboration and partnerships in response to the global crisis. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to emerging markets context and further research is needed on this important topic. Originality/value: This paper is relevant given the current global pandemic caused by the COVID-19. There are relatively limited research studies on the cross-sector partnerships and their role in global emergencies, grand challenges and global crisis, thus this paper offers important insights on cross-sector partnerships and their value creation in global crisis situations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive learning; Collaboration; COVID-19; Cross-sector partnerships; Emergency management; Grand challenges",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097509519

Drug repositioning has also attracted considerable attention in the pharmaceutical industry due to its time and cost efficiency in the drug development process compared to the traditional de novo drug discovery process. Recent advances in genomics, the tremendous growth of large-scale publicly available data, the availability of high-performance computing capabilities, along with the rise of machine learning, have further motivated the development of computational drug repositioning approaches. Investigating the relationship between different biomedical entities (e.g., drugs, diseases, genes) is one vital part of most recent studies in the drug repositioning field. Drug–disease interaction (R-DI) prediction is another main issue in drug repositioning research. Combining these relationships and interactions when introducing computational methods to identify novel drug–disease interactions with high accuracy is very challenging. In this study, we propose a robust approach, SNF–CVAE, for predicting novel drug–disease interactions using drug-related similarity information and known drug–disease interactions. SNF–CVAE integrates similarity measures, similarity selection, similarity network fusion (SNF), and collective variational autoencoder (CVAE) to conduct a non-linear analysis and improve the drug–disease interaction prediction accuracy. We evaluated the robustness of SNF–CVAE using different information models, drug similarity calculation measures, and drug similarity information. Moreover, we compared SNF–CVAE performance with four state-of-the-art machine learning models. SNF–CVAE achieved outstanding performance in stratified 5-fold cross-validation (Prec = 0.902, Rec = 0.883, F1 = 0.893, AUC-ROC = 0.958, and AUC-PR=0.970). Furthermore, we showed the efficiency of SNF–CVAE in predicting novel drug–disease interactions by validating the top-ranked interactions against pharmaceutical indications and clinical trial studies, which resulted in substantial pieces of evidence for almost all of RDIs predicted by our proposed model. To further demonstrate the reliability and robustness of SNF–CVAE, we conducted two case studies on the top predicted drug candidates for potentially treating Alzheimer's disease and Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which were successfully validated against clinical trials and published studies.

Developers of configuration systems act as designers, although they do not often recognize that they are performing as such. Moreover, exploring solution spaces is typically not integral to configuration projects, as this task is typically perceived as mapping existing knowledge to the configurator. This article argues that developing configurators may be understood by distinguishing between the problem and solution spaces using design thinking (DT). Design/methodology/approach: A multiple-case-study approach with four configuration projects is adopted to study two projects involving DT and compare them to two similar projects not involving DT. Data collection depended on multiple data sources via workshops and semi-structured interviews. Findings: First, DT methods and concept–knowledge (C-K) theory are integrated into configuration projects. Second, the application of DT during configurator development is presented through workshops and interviews, which demonstrates the benefits of DT in overcoming existing challenges. Research limitations/implications: The case studies demonstrate the successful implementation of DT in developing configurators. However, a limited number of cases in only one company limits the generalizability of the results. Practical implications: The framework's individual steps create a structured approach to supporting industrial companies with a toolbox of DT techniques and methods for configuration projects. Originality/value: The results show that the application of DT to configuration projects can improve user motivation, stakeholder satisfaction and knowledge acquisition. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Configurator; Design thinking; Knowledge management; Problem; Product configuration; Solution space","Expert systems; Knowledge acquisition; Configuration system; Design/methodology/approach; Industrial companies; Multiple data sources; Product configuration; Product customization; Semi structured interviews; Stakeholder satisfactions; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091347184

Design science approach was used to analyse the impact of the 3D printing (3DP) interventions on specific outcomes and to develop frameworks for hospitals to invest in 3DP, which were validated through further interviews with stakeholders. Findings: Evidence from this research shows that deploying customised on-demand 3DP can reduce surgical flow time and its variability while improving clinical outcomes.

The authors investigate what characterises the identity change process experienced by students when exposed to pedagogical nudging. Design/methodology/approach: Using ethnography, the authors apply an experiential-explorative approach to collecting data. The authors collected 1,015 individual reflection logs from 145 students of which the authors sampled 290 for this paper combined with interviews, observational and documentary data. Findings: Pedagogical nudging techniques help (1) expose and challenge the student habitus by planting footprints in the mind; (2) straddle the divide between student and nascent entrepreneur by enabling them to recognise and experiment with an entrepreneurial habitus and (3) figuratively learn to climb the entrepreneurial tree by embracing an entrepreneurial habitus. In the first step, the authors use the interventions as cognitive means of influencing (pedagogical nudging). In the second, students participate in an iterative meaning-making process through reflection. In the third, they internalise the “new” entrepreneurial habitus—or discard it. Research limitations/implications: The authors extend existing knowledge about the effect of particular kinds of pedagogies in entrepreneurship teaching, and how these can support enterprising behaviour. The authors demonstrate how an exploration of the inner self, identity and beliefs develops the capacity for students to re-shape future outcomes and create value. Practical implications: By using nudging pedagogies, educators can support students to develop new ways of acknowledging and coping with transformative learning.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper develops a model to evaluate when it is preferable for a firm to extend the product line in a vertical or horizontal direction. Consumers are modeled as being vertically heterogeneous with respect to their valuation of quality and horizontally heterogeneous with respect to their preference on the esthetic component of the product. These model characteristics allow us to consider a broader set of product line extension strategies. By considering both a vertically integrated channel and a decentralized channel, this study investigates how channel structure influences optimal product line design. The problem with supplemental numerical analyses is mathematically analyzed. Findings: The analysis shows that a horizontal product line extension strategy that offers the customized product can be used as an alternative to a vertical product line extension strategy. If the fixed cost is not too high, offering the customized product with low quality may be preferred to the quality-based segmentation strategy. Furthermore, the analysis shows that the channel structure is influential as the preference for the horizontal product line extension strategy is more pronounced in the decentralized channel than in the centralized channel. Research limitations/implications: The analysis presented in this paper is limited by the consideration of full market coverage. Further research is needed to see how the results can be generalized to the case with partial market coverage. Practical implications: The analysis suggests that a firm may consider product customization as part of its product line strategy. Information regarding market characteristics and channel structure is important when deciding on the optimal product line design. Originality/value: The model reflects a more realistic marketing strategy and channel structure than previous studies that typically consider product line extension in only one direction and focus on the centralized distribution channel. Combining the standard product line extension and customization strategies also represents an important contribution to the literature. These extensions produce interesting new results and insights into a firm’s optimal product line design strategy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Customization; Distribution channel; Horizontal differentiation; Product line design; Vertical differentiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092478879

Design/methodology/approach: Following the guiding principles of Foucault’s archaeology of knowledge and the methodological orientation of critical discourse analysis, the authors analyze a systematically produced corpus of 190 academic articles from 56 publication outlets. Findings: The study identifies three discourses of health and food dominant in marketing and consumer research. Each of the three discourses blends the ideology of healthism with market(ing) ideologies and provides a unique perspective on the meanings of health and health risks, the principles of appropriate consumer conduct and the role of marketing in regard to consumer and societal well-being. Research limitations/implications: The study contributes to research into ideologies in and of marketing by introducing useful concepts that help explain the role of healthism in marketing discourse. Practical implications: The finding of three dominant discourses could help reduce at least some of the existing complexity in regard to conflicting knowledge existing in the domain of health and food, and thus could inspire a more reflective body of work by researchers, policymakers and marketers towards improved food-related well-being.

This enacted character of context is relevant as methodological reflection as well as during analysis of empirical phenomena.

In many countries, policymakers have rushed to re-organise care services to meet the ‘surge demand’ and ‘waves’ of COVID-19 infection and disease. Such strategies signal important and sweeping changes in the organisation of both ‘COVID’ and ‘non-COVID’ care, whilst asking more fundamental questions about the long-term organisation of care ‘after COVID’. This includes, for example, unprecedented patterns and levels of funding; new ways of governing, managing and leading services; and the reconfiguration of clinical teams and frontline care delivery. In some contexts, COVID-19 has exposed the fragilities and vulnerabilities of long held ways of organising care, especially where services operate at the very brink of resource constraints or at near full capacity.

What makes the rise of international Chinese R&D remarkable is that this is-alongside India-one of the first such endeavors by a developing country with already one of the most substantial global R&D footprints, even including Western countries. Similar motivations and challenges of earlier R&D globalization are replicated and observed also in the recent Chinese internationalization, with a few emerging country-specific nuances, such as the focus on technology acquisition through merger and acquisition (M&A) and suspected central coordination by the Chinese government, which has given rise to challenges of its own for Chinese multinational corporations (MNCs). In this respect, China seems to have been the victim of its own success; the future of Chinese R&D internationalization bears both opportunities and challenges for the global innovation community. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Chinese MNEs/MNCs; Emerging market innovation; Global innovation; Internationalization; Location drivers; OFDI; R&D strategy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133067425

Building spaces for creative education is complex and includes mental and affective dimensions for embodied, sensory and artistic practices to unfold throughout all disciplines. Creative spaces in education are material and discursive, and their establishment by means of ‘metamorphotic’ processes encompass the ways in which spaces are conceived, designed, used and understood. The consequences of these material-discursive practices in education have the potential to impact future creative industries in several ways: creative education might provide creative entrepreneurs with skills and knowledge. Secondly, a paradigm-change in education might influence policies at micro (educational institutions) and macro (governments) levels, leading decision makers’ attitudes and actual resolutions in a direction that is more open to arts-based spaces and original material frames. Thirdly, a socio-political mindset that is more open towards creative interventions might offer creative industries and entrepreneurs better employment opportunities. Even though needed, the metamorphosis of the educational space for creative purposes meets a number of practical challenges. The present chapter addresses these topics in a performative and associative style, by means of drama, disseminating original empirical data. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Federica De Molli and Marilena Vecco; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131984421

The first is characterized by the use of new identity claims to consolidate new and emerging practices, and incorporate them into the organizational culture. The second acknowledges how members may be pushed to alter established cultural practices by a severe misalignment between image and identity. The third draws attention to the role of new identity claims, articulating a new vision for the distant future, to stimulate the incorporation of new elements in the organizational culture. © Oxford University Press 2021.","Culture change; Identity change; Organizational culture; Organizational identity; Organizational identity dynamics; Temporality; Vision",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131466949

In specific, the chapter shows how managers during polyphonic communication processes where managerial authority, power, and differing interests are at stake balance multiple voices. Based on a micro-ethnographic approach, the study illustrates how discursive, micro-level practices like idiomatic formulations can play a decisive role in accomplishing a position of authority that in consequence allows the speaker to direct or re-direct the ongoing discussion about strategic decisions. Authority here is not a stable, pre-assigned position that can be employed strategically in the interaction. Instead, the study reveals that authority as a way to control future actions is accomplished by means of locally situated discursive practices in form of idiomatic formulations. Moreover, the chapter contributes methodologically to the growing research on micro-foundations of authority by demonstrating the usefulness of video-based micro-ethnography to advance our understanding of the relationship between the interactional establishment of authority, the reliance on idiomatic formulations, and the dynamics between multivocality and univocality. © 2022 selection and editorial matter.

The endeavour goes beyond demonstrating particular practices or the significance of branding phenomena in this region. Rather, the aim is to compile and structure a growing body of research dealing with Nordic place branding and assess its global relevance and academic implications. The Nordic is approached not only as a geographical context of place branding, but also as an approach - an ideological mindset - that shapes place branding concepts, strategies and tactics. Boldly put, the ‘Nordic wave’ is proposed as a hybrid scholarly approach, which bridges across managerial and critical schools as well as sensitively engaging with place branding practitioners. It is argued that these distinct features allow the Nordic wave in place branding to travel across geo-political and scholarly boundaries, and carry the potential of expanding place branding research and practices on an international scale. © Dominic Medway, Gary Warnaby and John Byrom 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130866564

In the business environment, Danish companies have largely adopted global responsibility standards and perform well on environmental, social and governance aspects. In this chapter, we examine whether these high social responsibility standards reflect in young job seekers’ preferences when choosing an employer. For this purpose, we survey 86 students in social sciences and management to assess the importance of 25 employer attributes. The results demonstrate a prevailing importance of firms’ responsibility towards employees and general workplace attractiveness, which both have direct influences on the individual.

This is reflected by the fact that major Danish companies have promoted the global CSR and sustainability agenda since the 1990s. The Scandinavian countries in general have succeeded in earning a reputation as global sustainability front runners, and Denmark is part of that storyline. The general storyline is about a transformation from limited understandings of CSR to more comprehensive conceptions of sustainability that include. To show this development, the chapter provides a review of CSR in Denmark spanning the last couple of decades with a purview to government initiatives, the significance of the industrial foundations, and the impact of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). First, two examples are presented of how the government has been actively advancing CSR, making it mandatory for larger businesses to report on the expanding agenda on corporate sustainability, and by establishing ‘The Mediation and Complaints-Handling Institution for Responsible Business Conduct’ in 2012—this is the Danish national OECD contact point. Second, particular to the Danish business tradition are the Danish industrial foundations. They can be argued to provide favorable conditions for CSR by means of corporate governance that includes the long-term interest and the common good of society. Third, from the launch of the UN SDGs in 2015, the SDGs have been embraced across all sectors, ranging from the state to major corporations and civil society. The SDG agenda exemplifies a bottom-up governance approach that adjusts well to the Danish tradition for voluntary engagement in democratic decision-making of civil society. We foresee that the SDGs provide a call for new forms of leadership and management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130789015

The approach builds upon the calculation and verification of revenue blueprints that are based on a supplier’s own best implemented practice and achieved revenues. The advantage of revenue blueprints lies in its reliance on the firm’s established best implemented practice, its current market offerings, and its existing customers.

The World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020. On December 15, 2020, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDP) reported 71 503 614 cases and 1 612 833 deaths worldwide. The negative impacts of COVID-19 are not only limited to the loss of human lives, but also include short- and long-term social, economic and political effects. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2020), for example, forecasts that a long-lasting and more intensive COVID-19 outbreak is likely to drop global growth to 1.5 percent in 2020, which is half the projected rate of growth prior to the outbreak, with implications for international tourism.

We demonstrate how storytelling science can be helpful in exploring differences between sustainability strategies and their connections to some other aspect of business modelling. Discussing on the overview of “storytelling science” and SBM strategy, we organize our conceptualization into three sections: (i) how SBM and storytelling in socially responsible capitalism can help understand what is socially and ecologically sustainable, rather than only what is profitable to particular stakeholders; (ii) how are the methodological and philosophical perspectives and (iii) what are the drivers, enablers, barriers in the implementation of an SBM strategy. © Stefan Markovic, Cristina Sancha and Adam Lindgreen 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130207316

One of the main reasons is the misunderstanding that occupational health and safety (OHS) and productivity are contradictory, and that the main instrument to ensure competitiveness is low salaries and ignoring OHS risks. This chapter shows how lean can be used to integrate OHS and productivity in operations at the micro level. However, to ensure implementation, it is necessary for factory management at the meso level to move beyond the contradiction myth and commit to the change process. Yet, despite the benefits for both factory owners and workers of integrated OHS and productivity, the institutional setting around the garment factories do not sufficiently support the change process. Buyers must support their suppliers in the change process and regulatory bodies such as labour inspections as well as multi-stakeholder initiatives are needed to create the necessary attention to OHS. © Mohammad B.

Embracing product sustainability-related differentiators provides such an opportunity. Our study examines the challenge for organizations to understand how customers perceive environmental and social dimensions of sustainability. To achieve this, the study explores and defines these two dimensions based on, first, a review of extent literature and, second, focus group research within a leading supplier of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning equipment. The study takes place in the Netherlands in seven different types of hospitals and one private imaging center. Five social aspects, together covering eleven indicators, are identified. These are tested via 22 customer perception interviews with key decision making stakeholders (within the hospitals or imaging center) involved in purchasing of MRI scanning equipment. Respondents find environmental and social sustainability dimensions personally relevant, but professionally secondary to cost, performance, and ability to use MRI scanning equipment within organizations’ physical infrastructure. Finally, incorporating a product’s environmental and social credentials within marketing of MRI scanning equipment enhances the perception of the product offering in decision making stakeholders’ minds and provide differentiation. © Stefan Markovic, Cristina Sancha and Adam Lindgreen 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130202297

Using a firm-and institutional-level analysis, our study investigates a critical case from the Bangladeshi garment industry and explores the reasons, rooted in institutions and the business system, that cause firms to become ‘locked in’ at a particular stage of the upgrading ladder. We analyse the nature of the institutions and business systems of Bangladesh and examine how the characteristics of institutions and business systems affect firms’ lock-in. Our study explores four causes of ‘lock-in’: i) a lack of socially-constructed entrepreneurial vision (i.e. focusing on multiple venture creation, political affiliation and power, supply and manufacturing capacity and profit maximization) and ii) ownership and management characteristics, which do not support upgrading to own brand manufacturing (OBM), iii) the nature of governance between buyers and suppliers, and iv) inconsistency in institutional characteristics. The latter issue is seen, for example, in low levels of trust between firms, a lack of government incentives for design lab development and brand internationalisation, inadequate management of bank financing for upgrading, a lack of intermediary institutions to support internationalisation, and low-quality management education. Our study contributes to the GVC and business systems literature by exploring the reasons for the ‘lock-in’ condition that existing literatures have ignored. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C.

In this chapter we discuss the increasing importance of corporate responsibility (CR) and its strategic role in impacting consumer reactions towards companies and their brands. We further explore whether and how the effectiveness of responsible business practices may vary among brands and CR domains. Previous studies investigating the impact of CR on brands have focused either on CR domains separately or one brand characteristic at a time, neglecting their potential interplay. This chapter highlights the importance of juxtaposing the domains of corporate engagement (i.e., environmental and social) and considering these domains in the context of multiple brand characteristics (i.e., the level of relational and performance aspects of the brand). © Stefan Markovic, Cristina Sancha and Adam Lindgreen 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130193268

It captures a perspective on business that is pivotal for firms and their managers to understand and address broader changes that call for a holistic, dynamic view on a firm’s way of doing business. The background of this chapter is the apparent urge by some firms to enact business model innovation (BMI), and especially business model innovation for sustainability (BMIfS). We identify a set of issues that need further research, based on a review of studies that investigate and apply the BM concept in relation to innovation and sustainability.

Drawing on internationalization and GVC perspectives, we examine the critical case of DBL Apparel Company from Bangladesh, which supplies many global brands, including Sweden’s H & M, and has internationalized into Ethiopia. As the company appears to be the first Bangladeshi garment firm to have internationalized, we conduct an in-depth examination over a three-year period of the process and the antecedents affecting the firm’s overseas expansion. We explore how the buyer’s business model, institutional features, and the supplier’s entrepreneurial capability influence DBL’s internationalization. In particular, our study demonstrates how the buyer’s market-driving approach, value creation, delivery, and proposition shape how the buyer shows commitment to the supplier’s internationalization. At the same time, the supplier’s entrepreneurial capability, consisting of visionary leadership, commitment, learning intent, absorptive capacity, and dynamic management skills contribute to its decision to internationalize. Our analysis reveals that a supplier firm does not move toward internationalization based on one-sided commitment only; instead, it is the ‘shared commitment’ of both buyer and supplier in the GVC that contributes to the supplier’s decision to internationalize. We also demonstrate the influence of institutional characteristics in both home and host countries, particularly the role of government and the logics of doing business that facilitate the internationalization decision and process. Our study contributes to internationalization business and GVC literatures. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C. Allen 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130145532

However, multinational companies (MNCs) organize and manage the GVCs that are continuously seeking international locations possessing a business community that could add value by increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of product and service provision. Emerging economies are the ones in which such locations are often found. Using a single case study from the garment industry in Vietnam we explore how the case company internationalizes from Vietnam and what roles innovation play in shaping the internationalization path. We frame this study on global value chain and upgrading models. Our study finds a U-shaped internationalization model that the case company followed. Efficiency and reactive innovations played a crucial role for the first degree of internationalization on the global outsourcing market. While the domestic market demand and proactive innovations related to design and brand played a crucial role as a pre-requisite for a second degree of internationalization. The study contributes to the literature by aligning the internationalization path with an innovation path (reactive, interactive, and proactive innovation). Finally, we conclude that the upgrading theory drawn from the global value chain literature should, and could be, aligned with the broader frame of innovation theory. © Mohammad B.

We also explore the role of purchasing and supply management (PSM) in this process. We report on five pilot cases from the Italian luxury fashion and food industries, uncovering how companies in these sectors apply the diffusion strategies and the role of PSM. Our findings reveal marked differences in terms of sustainability maturity levels: in some companies the right intentions are in place but not necessarily followed by adequate actions. Our cases show how PSM can play a critical role in sustainability diffusion often in collaboration with Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or Sustainability functions. © Stefan Markovic, Cristina Sancha and Adam Lindgreen 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130112641

Despite impressive growth rates and gradual upgrading along the global apparel value chain, Vietnamese suppliers remain largely reliant on low-cost labour and imported materials, facing the challenge of developing new capabilities to sustain their global competitiveness. Our study approaches this challenge from a dynamic capabilities perspective with the aim to understand the strategic options for Vietnamese apparel exporters to enhance their competitiveness. Based on a qualitative study of six cases, we identify two patterns of dynamic capability development and a number of GVC-dependent and home country institutional constraints. We discuss these findings, propose a blended logic of dynamic capability development, and suggest policy implications as well as future research possibilities. © Mohammad B. Rana and Matthew M.C.

Earlier research has focused primarily on law as an instrument for calibrating existing agency towards sustainability ex post, for example through regulatory interventions geared towards steering actors towards lower carbon emissions or increased social protection. We contrast this established view by positing the central role of law for creating sustainability agency in the first place. For example, the private law institutions of contract and corporation have for long maintained that economic actors are not liable for externalities, such as the social, environmental, cultural or economic problems attributed to production. In doing so, law creates complex agency that is central for all economic production and for which sustainability related functions are not obligatory but voluntary, unless regulation later on counters the initial voluntary approach to sustainability. In order to develop approaches towards sustainability, it is imperative to focus on both of these two aspects of law and sustainability agency, that is, recognize law not only as an instrument for steering ex post but also as a creator of specific sustainability mindsets ex ante. This is especially important in relation to new forms of organization, such as global value chains and digital platforms, that can override sustainability regulation designed to counter the sustainability deficits of earlier forms of organization, such as centralized mass production. © Satu Teerikangas, Tiina Onkila, Katariina Koistinen and Marileena Mäkelä 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129907115

In consumer policy, the conditions and rights of consumers are central and the overall goal of public policy is to enable consumers to make an informed choice and grant them a number of rights to improve their position in the market. From the perspective of business, corporations and associations must therefore enter a challenging policy field where agendas are often defined by consumers, although business, in general, seeks to define many of the same issues in terms of competition policy. Different institutions are involved in the regulation of consumer affairs and different models are established across the world, but there are also initiatives in the business community to set rules and standards although they are usually not as strong and encompassing as those adopted in traditional public policy. Through globalization, the framework for consumer policy is changing, however. It has become increasingly difficult for consumers and consumer movements to catch up with the stronger globalization of business and the consumer perspective has become weaker in this process. © Aynsley Kellow, Tony Porter and Karsten Ronit 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129901053

An empirical study among Norwegian exporting SMEs indicates that international growth expectations as well as strategic orientations (growth, learning, international) are significantly higher in firms in which top management teams are larger, more diverse and more experienced.

The ‘rootlessness’ of highly digitalized businesses, operating across the globe without physical presence, their reliance on intangible assets, and networked multi-sided business models fundamentally challenge an international tax regime built for 20th century brick-and-mortar commerce. In this chapter, we survey the rise of the digital tax agenda and the new interest constellations it is fostering in international tax politics by reviewing the main interests and arguments advanced by different state coalitions in these discussions. We focus in particular on corporate taxation of large tech companies, prompted by rising public concern with the behavior of digital giants like Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon, which has incited critical political attention to the social contributions of these firms. In this context, we document the fracturing of the historical alliance between Europe and the United States, which underpinned the international tax system throughout the 20th century, and we discuss how increasingly powerful emerging economies with large markets, namely India and China, are reacting to revenue losses from digitalization. New interest coalitions between countries, mainly based on consumer market size and the size of the domestic tech sector, show how digitalization renders the traditional division between “source” and “residence” countries less important, while the continued dominance of the OECD as the organizational focal point of reform attempts informs us how established institutions continue to shape the global political debate on taxing the digital economy. © Lukas Hakelberg and Laura Seelkopf 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129660348

The analysis builds on a case study from a Danish school where games are used to motivate second graders to maximize their learning. The current learning paradigm views the intensity of competition as desirable for motivational purposes. At the same time, the downsides of competition are seemingly avoided because there is no scarcity of prizes and therefore no losers. It becomes an open question whether game-playing is in fact competition or not. Individual students must therefore decide themselves whether competing is the most effective way of sustaining their learning. The analysis concludes that current ambivalences towards competition do not primarily stem from a care for cooperation and community but from a care for the individual’s maximized learning.

We argue that contests are traps, funnelling both the wary and unsuspecting into competitive relationships through the lure of material and symbolic rewards. Empirically, our argument proceeds through paired case studies. The first case examines how a straightforward (if technically daunting) educational project designed to teach newcomers the basics of laboratory techniques is transformed into a competitive project when a potential prize is introduced.

Our analyses show that digital entrepreneurship not only involves entrepreneurial agency and digital technologies, but also affects previous conceptualizations of artifacts and of its modus operandi by applying a broader repertory of architectural arrangements. This implies that the employment of digital technologies in entrepreneurial ventures has effects that go well beyond using digital technology as a means-to-an-end.

Second, we examine the Chinese and Japanese EV policies. In China, the focus is on new energy vehicles excluding hybrid EVs, whereas in Japan the hybrid vehicles industry is strong. Third, as electrification of heavy-duty transport remains challenging, biomethane is considered as a solution in this segment by looking at the case of Finland.

It is premised on the understanding that African firms may experience “liabilities of localness” when marketing renewable energy products developed in the West. That is, customers doubt their capabilities to produce and install these products. Thus, market-driven growth of the solar energy sector in Ghana requires firm-level capability development through institutional support that promotes effective cross-border inter-firm collaborations as well as trust-building relationships with local customers. The results of the study confirm these observations. They show that Ghanaian consumers tend to evaluate the capabilities of foreign solar energy providers as superior to those of local firms. However, collaborations between local and foreign firms have enhanced their credibility. Firms rely mainly on word-of-mouth recommendations to attract new customers and see customer price consciousness as a major growth constraint. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Using an exploratory survey approach on 17 Danish firms, the study shows there is less emphasis on cost than in past studies and a large unstructured human influence. A framework containing six categories of ILD factors – cost, labour and social characteristics, infrastructure, politics and regulations, economics and markets and resources – and an assessment of their respective single factors are presented. Lastly, the paper identifies five major shortcomings in the current practice: unstructured processes, non-involvement of the operational level of the organisation, static perspective of dynamic factors, uneven balance between quantitative and qualitative factors and no organisational learning. For engineering managers facing an ILD, the insights in this paper can be used to reflect and identify potential shortcomings in own practice of ILDs and help refocusing future process designs.

Results show that small financial incentives increased managers' adoption of the program by 7 percentage points. Frontline workers' subsequent data generation and performance information acquisition were also increased in the incentive treatment groups, even though the latter was not incentivized. Reminders paired with incentives had an impact on the managers' adoption, but the reminder effect disappeared during the implementation phase. These findings demonstrate both the potentials and limitations of applying behavioral research on individual residents to hierarchical organizations. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The aim of this article is to develop a theoretical framework of risk management in public service delivery and an associated, standardized, individual-level scale for use in studying leadership behavior. The article develops and tests a second-order model of risk management, employing insights from qualitative interviews with 16 public service managers and data from a survey of 187 public service managers and 698 of their employees. The factor structure was tested and validated using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The results show that the scale correlates with public service motivation, turnover intention, and visionary leadership, which provides evidence of criterion and convergent validity. The scale has no relationship to number of work hours or age, which is supportive of discriminant validity. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126472613

Furthermore, we look at the transactional theory of stress and coping, which explains how stress emerges between the interaction of individuals and their environment and how individuals cope with stress. With these theories, we explore technostress as a workplace issue in knowledge work. Technostress refers to the challenges of adopting and coping with new digital technologies and affects knowledge workers’ well-being at work. In this chapter, we combine the task-technology fit theory with the transactional theory of stress and coping in a conceptual framework that workplace researchers can use to investigate the implementation of new digital technologies and their maintenance in workplaces while minimising technostress. We propose to apply and test the conceptual framework through action research by applying methods that can reduce the negative effects of technostress, for example building awareness of technostress, minimising techno-stressors, and establishing adaptive coping mechanisms. While contributing to work-related stress research, participatory interventions may also assist organizations in reducing the effects of technostress. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Nelda Vendramin, Giulia Nardelli, and Christine Ipsen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126450639

The first goal of the study was to reconceptualize the attractive force of places. Instead of simply conceiving places as passively waiting to be visited, the researchers wanted to highlight their force of attraction. Since the municipality brands itself as ‘the realm of nature’, we set out to investigate how ŉature’, always man-made to some extent, could be viewed as a force of its own. The second goal was to step away from the conventional understanding of tourists as simply consumers of places and treat them not as strangers and guests to the places, but as potential hosts and designers of place experiences. Furthermore, the researchers reversed traditional identity mechanisms by treating those tourists who returned year after year as part-time locals (GravariBarbas and Guinand, 2017). Creative, playful, and reflexive engagement with places is certainly present in the two interventions that take nature in general and wind in particular as natural rough resources that are important drivers of the experience economy of the west coast of the spectacle of the wind-installation. © CAB International 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126398295

The index is based on estimates of the frontier obtained from the convex envelopment of the data as in DEA. The statistical properties of the Malmquist index and its components, i.e. the frontier shift and the efficiency change, have until recently only been subject to a limited number of studies. The asymptotic properties of the geometric mean of the individual Malmquist indexes have been studied in the literature. Permutation tests for performing statistical inference in finite samples have recently been proposed and are easily performed. In the present paper we illustrate the permutation methods by an analysis of data comprising organic and conventional dairy farms in Denmark from 2011–2015. Further, differences between the frontiers of the production possibility sets for two separate samples are studied, specifically those of the organic and the conventional producers. We suggest to use jackknife methods when estimating the differences to ensure that these are not affected by the well-known bias originating from estimation of the frontier. In summary, the paper offers an illustration of how to analyse productivity data, in particular a comparison of two independent groups, and furthermore an analysis of how the separate groups evolve over time is provided. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Frontier differences; Independent samples; Malmquist index; Organic farming; Permutation tests",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126089539

Design/methodology/approach: This research design is guided by our research question: How can manufacturers develop a learning-to-learn capability that enables Industry 4.0 adoption? The authors adopt action research to generate actionable knowledge from a two-year-long action learning intervention at the Danish rooftop window manufacturer VELUX. Findings: Drawing on emergent insights from the action learning intervention, it was found that a learning-to-learn capability based on lean was a core construct and enabler for manufacturers to adopt Industry 4.0 successfully. Institutionalizing an organizational learning scaffold encompassing the intertwined learning processes of systems Alpha, Beta and Gamma served as a significant way to develop a learning-to-learn capability for Industry 4.0 adoption (systematic problem-solving abilities, leaders as learning facilitators, presence of a supportive learning environment and Industry 4.0 knowledge). Moreover, group coaching is a practical action learning intervention for invoking system Gamma and developing leaders to become learning facilitators – an essential leadership role during Industry 4.0 adoption. Originality/value: The study contributes to theory and practice by adopting action research and action learning to explore learning-to-learn as a core construct for enabling Industry 4.0 adoption and providing a set of conditions for developing a learning-to-learn capability. Furthermore, the study reveals that leaders are required to act as learning facilitators instead of relying on learning about and implementing Industry 4.0 best practices for enabling adoption. © 2021, Henrik Saabye, Thomas Borup Kristensen and Brian Vejrum Wæhrens.","Action learning; Action research; Group coaching; Industry 4.0; Lean",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125891556

More recently, living labs have also emerged as a specific approach to open innovation processes in the context of publics across the EU. Nevertheless, it is still not clear how the understanding of living labs can be translated and organized into new sectorial settings, what type of public sector innovation challenges it addresses, and what role citizens and users have. The aim of this article is therefore to explore and analyze how living labs are applied as processes for public sector innovation. Based on a mixed method approach of 21 European living lab cases, the analysis reveals a pattern of three different processes for living lab organizational and actor roles: living labs organized as cross-sectorial collaboration, living labs emerging within the public sector as main initiator and beneficiary, and living labs developed by civil society actors. The findings are presented as three scenarios for implementing living labs, which also acts as a background for the article's final discussion about the potentials and pitfalls of living labs in public sector contexts. © 2021 Carleton University.

This has increased the need to implement automation in warehouses. To be able to implement automation beneficially, at multiple warehouses with multiple customers owned by the same company, the processes, and the IT systems at the warehouses need to be streamlined and standardized. For this purpose, we suggest modeling an explicit architecture of the warehouses, and study which possible impact to reach from applying the architecture to standardize processes, IT systems, and in the end increase the implementation of automatization solutions. A case study of a logistics company with multiple warehouses around the world shows a big financial and growth potential to implement such an architecture. Based on previous implementations of product architecture the estimated potential of financial savings is up to 400.000 euros for a medium-large size warehouse. Streamlined processes agreed between the different departments and the implementation of similar automation will enable the company to share data and automation parts between the different warehouses. © 2021 IEEE.","Architecture; Automation; Modularization; Operation Management; Process Flow; Robots; Warehouse; Warehouse Management System","Architecture; Automation; Modular construction; Case-studies; Growth potential; IT integration; IT system; Logistics company; Modularizations; Operation management; Process flows; Processes integrations; Warehouse management systems; Warehouses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125426794

This implies that many companies implement SKU rationalisation programmes to deal with product and process complexity. However, many industry companies report that they do not gain the financial benefits that they expected from optimizing their portfolios. To improve the understanding of this phenomenon, this paper studies an unsuccessful SKU rationalisation project at a hearing healthcare company. The case study revealed that what appeared to be a great potential for reducing inventories through SKU rationalisation turned out to be more of an SKU management problem. Specifically, analyses showed that 19% of the hearing devices' product portfolios had multiple SKUs for the same product variant, and that SKU rationalisation would only produce minimal inventory-related benefits. The case study therefore demonstrates the importance of proper SKU management in identifying fruitful SKU rationalisation projects. © 2021 IEEE.","Customer decoupling point; Inventory costs; SKU management; SKU proliferation; SKU reduction","% reductions; Customer decoupling point; Decoupling point; Inventory costs; Stock keeping unit; Stock keeping unit management; Stock keeping unit proliferation; Stock keeping unit reduction; Audition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125390761

This study examines how vertical organizational communication in and around the Hoshin Kanri effort impacts the effort's chances of successful completion. The study researches two cases within one firm, a medium-sized manufacturer of medical devices. Each of the two cases constitutes 'one effort of developing and implementing a new strategy using Hoshin Kanri'. The first effort was unsuccessful, and the second effort builds on the learnings from the first effort. The study develops a set of five researchable propositions that connect vertical organization communication with Hoshin Kanri implementation success. The two cases reveal that effective vertical communication has profound effects on Hoshin Kanri success.

Empirical studies show the effects of promotional displays on sales; however, they seldom attend to the determinants of the effects of displays from the shoppers’ perspective. Thus, there are hardly any findings about the role of the display’s location in the shop. In this paper, we assume that the congruence of the product presented on the display with its setting has an influence on the effect of the display. In particular, we assume that although a display in an incongruent setting attracts more attention, it can turn this attention into purchases only to a lesser extent than a display in a congruent setting. The results of a field experiment in a Swiss grocery store support this assumption. Using observational techniques and electronic checkout data, we are able to show that displays in an incongruent setting gain more attention but lead to fewer sales than displays in a congruent setting. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Attention; In-store promotion; Promotional display; Purchase behavior",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125345394

The findings reveal that Finnish hard-service firms should establish a WOS in Spain if aiming to increase their global market share, and profit. Finnish subsidiaries in Spain should focus on the local business culture i.e., knowledge of the local language and business practices.

We hope, during the process of building a DT, the accidental complexity can be minimized by application of model-based systems engineering and the Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM).

We do so with reference to how brands enabled New Zealand's displaced Pakeha (white) majority to carve out a sense of we-ness against the backdrop of globalization and resurgent indigenous identity claims. Using multiple sources of ethnographic data, we develop a process model of how brands create national identity through we-ness. We find that marketplace actors deployed brands to create and renew perceptions of we-ness through four-stages: reification, lumping, splitting, and horizon expansion. From this, we make three primary contributions to the consumer research literature: we develop a four-part process model of how brands become national identity resources, explore the characteristics of the brands that enable the emergence of and evolution of we-ness, and explore how our processes can address a sense of dispossession among displaced-majorities in similarly defined contexts.

This paper focuses on a different kind of bias that has received very little attention: guideline bias, i.e., the bias introduced by how our annotator guidelines are formulated. We examine two recently introduced dialogue datasets, CCPE-M and Taskmaster-1, both collected by trained assistants in a Wizard-of-Oz set-up. For CCPE-M, we show how a simple lexical bias for the word like in the guidelines biases the data collection. This bias, in effect, leads to poor performance on data without this bias: a preference elicitation architecture based on BERT suffers a 5.3% absolute drop in performance, when like is replaced with a synonymous phrase, and a 13.2% drop in performance when evaluated on out-of-sample data. For Taskmaster-1, we show how the order in which instructions are presented, biases the data collection. ©2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics; Data acquisition; Natural language processing systems; Architecture-based; Data collection; Generalisation; Lexical bias; Performance; Poor performance; Preference elicitation; Sample data; Simple++; Wizard of Oz; Drops",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123954959

Using the Danish city of Aalborg as an empirical case, the chapter identifies both the synergies and divisions that typify cross-sector cooperation on sustainable place branding when trying to reconcile commercial and altruistic interests. The findings show that close integration between place-making and place-telling efforts is highly challenging, due to their general lack of visibility to tourist markets and the often low differentiation potential that sustainability measures offer to tourism firms. This results in such firms being hesitant to promote themselves as green and to utilize broad-based sustainable place brands developed to accommodate the needs of various different stakeholders. © Nicolas Papadopoulos and Mark Cleveland 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123750059

With the popularity of the data plane programming languages like P4, SDN network automation has extended from developing control plane applications and deploying controllers to integrating custom packet processing pipelines in this process. However, developing control and data plane applications can become burdensome since expertise in both fields is scarce. The process of automating SDN networks requires (among many tasks) inter-plane correlated application self-collection and assembly. As a result, the orchestrator presented in this paper, named P4click, provides high-level interfaces in order to transparently deploy modular control and data plane applications for SDN networks. This paper describes the architecture design of the orchestrator, outlines the deployment structure, and provides a general view of control plane application deployment and data plane pipeline assembly. Besides, P4click requires no previous knowledge of data plane programming and provides a simple interface for network operators that have to deploy new network functionalities. The results in this paper show which tasks in the network automation are most influential (timewise) in bringing a network up and running from the ground up. © 2021 IFIP.","automation; control plane; data plane; deployment; P4; SDN","Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Control planes; Data planes; Data-plane; Deployment; Modular control; Network automations; New approaches; Programmability; Programmable controls; Software-defined networkings; Automation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123441179

Smart contracts can not only manage the task or workflow execution but also the allocation of tasks in a decentralized and reliable fashion. In this paper, we leverage smart contracts as resource binders to match dynamically the resource with the best quality of service to a service request. If a match occurs, the system generates a binding agreement autonomously. The latter can be mapped to a business process management system to manage the task status.

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) introduced in 2011 the National Adaptation Plan (NAP) under the Cancun Adaptation Framework (CAF). Countries of the non-Annex I, described by the UN-General Assembly as especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, are invited to develop NAPs to identify adaptation challenges and devise appropriate climate adaptation responses. Recognizing the increasing vulnerability of urban systems to the effects of climate change, in 2019, UN-Habitat defined the supplement of the NAP process’s technical guidelines for addressing urban and human settlement issues in NAPs. This paper aims to propose a methodology to assess the urban content of the NAPs after ten years from that the CAF comes into force. The evaluation is based, adapting and expanding, on the methodology used to assess the urban content of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) published by UN-Habitat in 2017. The methodology aims to analyse both key adaptation challenges and responses explicitly or implicitly related to urban systems. Moreover, it aims at understanding the interlinkage of urban content in NAP in relation to other key policies, such as NDCs and National Urban Policies (NUPs). In this perspective, 172 indicators were selected and clustered into nine groups: (i) Geographic Indicators; (ii) General Indicators; (iii) NAPs General Indicators; (iv) NAPs Urban Indicators; (v) NDCs Indicators; (vi) NUPs Indicators; (vii) Urban content in National Policies Indicators; (viii) International policy linkages (including SDGs, Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, Paris Agreement and New Urban agenda); (ix) National plans/policy/strategies/reports linkages. The methodology was tested on Brazil’s NAP, trying to find general considerations to apply to the countries that officially submitted their NAPs between 2014 to 2020. The test showed that: there is a stronger focus on defining climate adaptation challenges more than responses; climate adaptation challenges and responses are predominantly identified at the national scale, with a focus on policies and strategies at the national level; among the Brazilian NAP, there is “cities strategy”, and it means that the NAP has a high urban content. In conclusion, the paper will highlight critical issues and improvements for each of the nine indices analysed. © 2021, Dei Tipografia del Genio Civile.

However, even though agile as a term has existed for only 20 years and started specifically as a method of working with software development, agility and methods derived from agility have spread to almost every part of the organization. From production optimization to project management and large-scale organizational frameworks. The use of agile methods has generally provided improvements for the organizations that choose to adopt them, but a steep learning curve contributes to a need for skilled people. This paper seeks to establish key theoretical fundamentals on agility related to management, leadership, and governance, by reviewing literature on agility. The key findings in the paper suggest that the essential processes of; control, work, and knowledge are significant contributors to ensuring success with agility. The paper will highlight these processes and elaborate on the three processes' relevance for organizational agile success, through the means of management, leadership, and governance. The categorization of the three processes is conducted through a theoretical taxonomic understanding of agility in organizations and literature. The practical implications of the paper are a specific outline of control, knowledge, and work processes within agile methods, specifically as the field of agile both in research and application have become muddled with frameworks and methods build upon the Agile Manifestos. The research implications of the paper are the showcasing of processes within agility that has potential for exploitation both in an organizational perspective, but also to support the authors' further research into deriving agility from a development specific focus to an operational aspect of the organization, with a production centered approach. This also correlates with the originality of the paper, which relates to theorizing on the implications of agility from development processes to the production-centered operations of the organization. © 2021 Proceedings of the 17th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2021.

Although festivals in practice are developing their function as innovation facilitators, there has been only little academic attention from both entrepreneurship and festival studies for this trend. This article brings together extant literature on entrepreneurial innovation and festival spaces to conceptualize how interactions enabled by festivals may support entrepreneurial value proposition development. Based on a qualitative exploratory case study of the innovation program of the Dutch Welcome to the Village festival it is shown that festivals can potentially facilitate useful interactions with various stakeholders for entrepreneurs. It is found that these interactions can inform the direction of the entrepreneurial process and product/service development. However, relevant potential interactions remained latent and the transference of the results beyond the festival was limited. Recommendations are made on how this potential of the festival may be more strategically exploited. We propose that a more purposeful interaction design could benefit the festival-innovation programs (e.g., by mapping the connections as we have in this article). It also recommended for managers of these innovation programs to develop organizational structures that bridge the apparent divide between the festival and real world. © 2021. Cognizant, LLC.

Methods: Semi-structured interviews, developed using piloting and peer review took place with fifteen elite female footballers from two English WSL clubs (age: 25.2 [18–33]). Data was audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed thematically using NVivo. Results: All players (100%) perceive their menstrual cycle to negatively impact performance. Analysing 27,438 words of data revealed five themes: A) symptoms, B) preparation, C) performance, D) recovery, and E) management. Over half (53%) of players experienced decreased appetite and sleep quality prior to performance during menstruation. Competitive performance was perceived to be most negatively impacted during menses (54 references) following by the pre-menstrual stage (23 references). During menstruation, the most impacted physical performance indicators were power (93%) and fatigue (87%). Psychologically, confidence, focus, and reaction to criticism were commonly affected (66.7%). Players reported missing training (13.3%) and matches (13.3%) due to severity of impact. Recovery was affected during the pre-menstrual (26.7%) and menstrual (66.7) stages. Players self-manage symptoms using over the counter (66.7%) and prescription (26.7%) medication, some prophylactically prior to competition (46.7%). Conclusions: This first attempt to ascertain player perception in football exposes a clear negative impact on performance. The complex interplay of biopsychosocial and logistical factors, lack of awareness and education highlight the need for further research. Intervention is necessary and immediate initiation would be prudent, starting with simple measures such as basic self-management advice, education, and provision of sanitary products. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","period; Professional; qualitative; soccer; women",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122152115

Recent literature has advanced our understanding of compliance as a social practice which is often related to resistance. Yet, compliance is seen as something we equate with simply yielding to power without any agency. We address this theme with a study of the effects of managerialism on academic work. More specifically, we investigate the introduction of measures and controls to improve PhD completion times in a research-intensive UK university. Our findings show that despite most of our respondents voicing concerns about the reductionist nature of the target and the consequences for quality, the large majority of academics we talked to complied with the measure. We identify three compliance types that demonstrate compliance is an interpretative process. We make two principal contributions with this paper. First, we offer insights into why compliance deserves analytic attention as a social practice in its own right, as something that goes beyond mere consent. Second, we analyze the impact of managerialism on higher education through the lens of compliance. We use these insights to reflect on how compliance was linked to resistance and the effects of different compliance practices on academic work which ranged from shifting responsibilities to challenging academic integrity. © The Author(s) 2021.","Compliance; consent; higher education; managerialism; resistance",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122145395

Our empirical results show that some subsectors of tourism are affected more than others. The connectedness of tourism companies has severely increased after March 2020. Restaurants are the most heavily influenced subsectors of tourism, while airline companies come the next.

It draws on phenomenological interviews with 26 food tourists. The study finds that extraordinary experience consists of elements such as profaneness, collaborative interactions and conflict-easing, which represent both the structural and anti-structural elements. The findings of this study allow us to question whether extraordinary experience is purely structural or anti-structural as suggested by previous research. Rather, based on the findings, we argue that extraordinary experience is the positive co-existence of both the ordinary and the non-ordinary.

TD refers to concessions made for short-term advantages or conveniences, which may result in long-term difficulties. Numerous TD management strategies have been proposed to avoid the severe consequences of leaving TD unchecked. However, these strategies often suffer from being too abstract, making it difficult to initiate TD deliberations. To investigate how software development companies can initiate such deliberations, we conducted an Action Research study in collaboration with a Danish software development department, SoftShelf. Through two Action Research interventions at SoftShelf, we introduced strategies and tools for TD management and reified them to their situation in order to initiate deliberations on the matter. After reporting the interventions’ practical consequences in SoftShelf, we discuss the usefulness of deliberation theory in TD management research and practice. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Action research; Deliberation theory; Technical Debt","Action research; Deliberation theory; Management practises; Management research; Management strategies; Research studies; Software company; Strategies and tools; Technical debts; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121855624

We demonstrate these effects at the board-level in a sample of 1,615 U.S. firms. Mimetic processes are evident, with firms' connectedness in board interlock networks attenuating profitability and decreasing firm value during recessions—a reversal of the positive effects during expansions. Normative pressures arise from homogeneity in directors’ educational and professional experience, with greater consequences for long-term performance. Overall, recessionary performance is improved when firms occupy relatively isolated positions in informational networks and appoint directors from a range of backgrounds. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Board composition; Board interlocks; Corporate governance; Recession; Strategic leadership","Industrial management; Board composition; Board interlock; Business cycles; Corporate governance; Counter-cyclical; Firm Performance; Information networks; Normative pressures; Recession; Strategic leadership; Information services",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121815793

Design/methodology/approach: The article stems from a research project about a BioMedical Design Fellowship. As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the Fellowship converted all teaching activities to online learning via Zoom, and the participant observations followed along. Taking an autoethnographic approach, the authors present and discuss concrete examples of encountered obstacles produced by the video-mediated format, such as limited access and interactions, technical glitches and changing experiences of embodiment. Findings: Changing embodiment in particular initially led the authors to believe that the “messiness” of ethnography (i.e. misunderstandings, emotions, politics, self-doubts etc.) was lost online. However, over time the authors realized that the mess was still there, albeit in new manifestations, because Zoom shaped the interactions of the people the authors observed, the observations the authors could make and how the authors related to research participants and vice versa. Practical implications: The article succinctly summarizes the key advice offered by the researchers (see Section 5) based on their experiences of converting on-site ethnographic observations into video-mediated observations enabling easy use by other researchers in relation to other projects and contexts. Originality/value: The article positions video-mediated observations, via e.g. Zoom, which are distinctly characterised by happening in real time and having an object of study other than the online sphere itself, vis-à-vis other “online ethnography” methods. The article further aims to enable researchers to more rapidly rediscover and re-incite the new manifestations of the messiness of ethnography online, which is key to ensuring high-quality research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","BioMedical design; COVID-19; Embodiment; Messiness; Methodological advice; Video-mediated observation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121793277

In a world with so many environmental challenges creating additional consumer items, even when they are labelled environmentally friendly, can and does have environmental consequences. We suggest that design thinking can and should include a more holistic systems thinking perspective as part of its drive to encourage corporate innovation. We argue that design thinking should take a much wider view of who are their stakeholders. In order to demonstrate the connection between corporate innovation, systems thinking and design thinking, we draw on a case study regarding the creation of a new data center. The case demonstrates how design thinking with elements of system thinking can be used to generate solutions that has positive impacts for multiple stakeholders, including the environment. The case study demonstrates that these combined perspectives can also be used as a teaching model to shift students’ mindsets towards not just finding solutions that suit a customer or a project owner, but also the environment and other stakeholders. The case demonstrates that practical positive results can be generated over a short period of time, with little investment. The case also highlights a successful approach to industry/university collaborations. The research delves into the basics of systems thinking, and how there is a connection with design thinking. We then discuss the teaching methodology and approach to using design thinking/systems thinking to solve the case challenge. We then present the results of the challenge and the discussion regarding how such projects can play a role in shifting students’ mindset towards having a more environmentally friendly perspective while engaging in corporate innovation. © 2021, Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

With their technical background, engineers hold key roles in developing solutions for future challenges and needs. This raises the question: How can education ensure that students graduate with entrepreneurial skills and competences, which enable them to create new value for others through action? To answer the call for innovative and entrepreneurial engineers VIA Engineering are undergoing a transformation of structure and content of all 7 engineering programs. Cornerstones in the transformation are a keen focus on Sustainability, Digitization, Entrepreneurship & Innovation and Problem Based Learning. VIA Engineering is based in Denmark with approx. 1.150 students and 80 teachers split on 7 programs. The programs are Machine, Material, Civil, Manufacturing, Global Business, Supply and Software. The planning of the restructuring started in 2019 and is effective from Summer 2021. This contribution will present the work done in relation to Entrepreneurship & Innovation. Inspired by Handscombe et al. (2009), who found that the most effective way of fostering Enterprising graduates in Engineering is by embedding entrepreneurial learning activities throughout the education in existing curricular, this contribution focuses on how this embedment can be operationalized and achieved. The contribution suggest a framework for progression in learning objectives at Engineering programs and an outline for developing competencies for educators to embed the new learning objectives. In extension, a shortlist of potential challenges/barriers is presented. Why is this interesting? There is an abundant number of arguments for including innovation & entrepreneurship in higher education.

The research design is a multiple case study covering a triadic supply chain with five fresh food product (FFP) processors, one wholesaler and nine retail stores. The analysis investigates how the product-, demand-, supply- and production-related PECs affect the material requirements planning and master production scheduling at the FFP processors. Further, it investigates how these affect information sharing at a product level. The findings propose a means to differentiate the information sharing in a supply chain at a product level, rather than differentiation based on demand type or processor which currently dominates the field.

The results of EE impact research have been equivocal, and one suggested explanation is the influence of contextual factors such as the types of learning experiences, gender, and discipline. In this paper, we answer the question of which contextual factors shape the outcome of EE examining the outcome variables of entrepreneurial intentions (EI) and creative self-efficacy (CSE). We collected data between 2016-2018 in Denmark, Finland, and the United States using quasi-experimental pre-post survey design. The data consists of 210 students from three universities who were exposed to three different learning experiences, namely, writing a business plan, achieving proof of concept, and achieving proof of business. Through multi-value qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), the results show four unique combinations associated with high levels of EI after a learning experience. It seems that high EI is associated with developing proof of concept and proof of business, but not with writing a business plan. Also, students’ fields of study and prior work experi ences play a role in high levels of EI regardless of the learning experience. Similarly, seven unique combinations are connected to high levels of CSE. It seems that high levels of CSE after a learning experience are associated with achieving proof of concept and achieving proof of business, but not with writing a business plan. In addition, students’ prior work experiences seem to play a role in CSE. These results imply that traditional business plan–based learning experiences may not generate the desired changes in attitudes from EE. Also, the results suggest that the effect that different learning experiences have on students may differ depending on contextual factors such as students’ backgrounds including field of study and prior work experience.","Entrepreneurship education; Learning experience; Practice-oriented learning; QCA","Business plans; Contextual factors; Creative self-efficacy; Denmark; Entrepreneurship education; Learning experiences; Practice-oriented learning; Proof of concept; Qualitative comparative analysis; Work experience",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121580045

To develop this view, I analyze the different entrepreneurial tactics actors employ to advance green architecture in the Danish construction industry.

But current evaluation practice in NLP, except for end-to-end tasks such as machine translation, spoken dialogue systems, or NLG, largely hinges on the existence of a single “ground truth” against which we can meaningfully compare the prediction of a model. However, this assumption is flawed for two reasons. 1) In many cases, more than one answer is correct. 2) Even where there is a single answer, disagreement among annotators is ubiquitous, making it difficult to decide on a gold standard. We discuss three sources of disagreement: from the annotator, the data, and the context, and show how this affects even seemingly objective tasks. Current methods of adjudication, agreement, and evaluation ought to be reconsidered at the light of this evidence. Some researchers now propose to address this issue by minimizing disagreement, creating cleaner datasets. We argue that such a simplification is likely to result in oversimplified models just as much as it would do for end-to-end tasks such as machine translation. Instead, we suggest that we need to improve today’s evaluation practice to better capture such disagreement. Datasets with multiple annotations are becoming more common, as are methods to integrate disagreement into modeling. The logical next step is to extend this to evaluation. ©2021 Association for Computational Linguistics",,"Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Machine translation; Speech processing; 'current; Data driven; End-to-end task; Gold standards; Ground truth; Machine translations; Research fields; Spoken dialogue system; Natural language processing systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121236999

This raises a further issue, is governance of a business affecting not only each of the outcomes, but also their coupling? A representative sample of 530 businesses in Iran was surveyed in 2018 for Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Innovation, export and growth-expectation are found to be lower in family businesses. Coupling between innovation and export, and also between export and growth-expectation, are found to be looser in family businesses.

Moreover, it will be known only after a daily bedside diagnosis of each patient. A hospital self-operated kitchen system in Thai hospitals uses static production planning by predetermined production quantity in advance of actual production for a week. Unlike in the new Danish public hospitals, patients can select their meals listed on a menu based on their health condition. Danish hospitals' centralized kitchen acted as a production hub providing postponed food to its network hospital within its area. Therefore, this paper explores how public hospitals in these two different countries manage and control their catering production systems. Two public hospitals in Thailand and one public hospital in Denmark are select as a case study. With the exploratory research approach, a result not only explored a detail of its supply chain and operations, including inbound operations, production, and outbound operations from the selected case study hospitals in both countries.

The concept of Open Innovation in Science (OIS) provides a framework that integrates dispersed research efforts aiming to understand the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of applying open and collaborative research practices. While the OIS framework has already been taken up by science of science scholars, its conceptual underpinnings require further specification. In this essay, we critically examine the OIS concept and bring to light two key aspects: 1) how OIS builds upon Open Innovation (OI) research by adopting its attention to boundary-crossing knowledge flows and by adapting other concepts developed and researched in OI to the science context, as exemplified by two OIS cases in the area of research funding; 2) how OIS conceptualises knowledge flows across boundaries. While OI typically focuses on well-defined organisational boundaries, we argue that blurry and even invisible boundaries between communities of practice may more strongly constrain flows of knowledge related to openness and collaboration in science. Given the uptake of this concept, this essay brings needed clarity to the meaning of OIS, which has no particular normative orientation towards a close coupling between science and industry. We end by outlining the essay’s contributions to OI and the science of science, as well as to science practitioners. © 2021 The Author(s).

Campaign-backers trust creators to complete projects and deliver rewards as outlined prior to the fundraising process, but creators may discover better opportunities as they progress with a project. Despite this, the all-or-nothing (AON) mechanism on crowdfunding platforms incentivizes creators to set meager funding-targets that are easier to achieve but may offer limited slack when creators wish to simultaneously pursue emerging opportunities later in the project. We explore the related issues of how funding targets seem to be selected by the creators, and how dissatisfaction with the rewards outcomes may arise for the backers. We constructed a quasi-experimental (QE) research design based on an extensive dataset from Kickstarter with nearly 390,000 campaigns. Our findings show that creators who set particularly meager funding-targets for their campaigns are more likely to receive sufficient funds but are less likely to satisfy backers with the project outcomes they deliver. We also test the moderating roles of creator and campaign characteristics. Overall, this study provides evidence that the funding mechanism used in rewards-based crowdfunding may be unsustainable in its current form, unless new mechanisms are introduced to realign the diverging incentives for creators and backers. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","C omputational social science (CSS); crowdfunding sustainability; fintech; incentives; information asymmetry; online fundraising; platforms; propensity-score matching (PSM); quasi-experiment; rewards-based crowdfunding","Crowdsourcing; Finance; Project management; C omputational social science; Crowdfunding sustainability; Incentive; Information asymmetry; Online fundraising; Platform; Propensity score matching; Propensity-score matching; Quasi-experiments; Reward-based crowdfunding; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120989338

This paper explores the role of employees in a manufacturer’s transition to a global engineering services provider. Based on the literature, a conceptual framework is defined, which specifies the dynamic interaction between employee reactions and management responses to determine the transition outcome. Evidence is presented from a single case study based on 21 interviews and observations as well as documents and media information. The findings empirically demonstrate how employee resistance, support and rejection of the globalisation strategy develop, resulting in the need for continuous management responses to ensure global integration. Exemplar employee reactions are prioritisation of local over global customers in service delivery due to lack of ownership, which were responded to by designing new organisational procedures to ensure local prioritisation of global customers with service contracts. This study contributes to the emerging field of global operations management by studying the operational contributions of employees and the respective management responses. This research focuses specifically on global services as a novel focal area within this emerging field. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","global engineering services; global manufacturing; Organisational transition; servitization","Industrial research; Manufacture; Engineering service; Global engineering service; Global engineerings; Global manufacturing; Global services; Manufacturing companies; Organisational transitions; Prioritization; Service transitions; Servitization; Human resource management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120795810

Consequently, it is crucial to ascertain what benefits society gains in return for the invested public resources. This paper presents a systematic literature review about the ex-post evaluation of STI projects to identify the relevant methodologies adopted to analyse with accuracy the direct/indirect results and the further deployment of impacts of STI projects, given that such impacts are difficult to foresee in the project objectives. Findings show that the majority of ex-post methodologies are complex to be applied for practitioners. Findings show that those that are meant to evaluate the direct and indirect impacts of STI projects are suitable, although only partially, for evaluating single or a few types of impacts, or they are oriented for specific contexts. The paper offers a better comprehension of the systemic relationship between STI projects' objectives, results, and impacts. Furthermore, a novel conceptual framework supporting policymakers, scholars, and practitioners to evaluate the interactions between the objectives, results and impacts in STI projects is drawn from the findings extending the theory. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ex-post evaluation; knowledge transfer; literature review; Technological innovation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120625097

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether environmental and social performance mediates the relationship between environmental management practices and operational performance and whether operational performance mediates the relationship between environmental and social performance and financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on a data set of 208 firms operating in a wide range of manufacturing industries, the authors test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. The research context for the study is Turkey, an important emerging market and one of the nexuses of European and Asian supply chains. Findings: The findings indicate that all three aspects of sustainability have mutually supportive relationships as demonstrated by positive mediating mechanisms between environmental management practices and operational performance and between environmental and social performance and financial performance. The mediation results correspond with the resource-based view. They indicate that building up capabilities and resources in the form of environmental management practices supports three areas of the triple bottom line and boosts firms’ financial performance. Originality/value: Research on sustainability is well-established, yet supply chain management research has, thus, far paid insufficient attention to all three aspects. This paper, thus, sets itself apart by explicitly considering all three aspects of sustainability and contributes to understanding how they relate to one another. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental performance; Financial performance; Social performance; Sustainability; Sustainable manufacturing",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120479919

This chapter provides examples of field studies that demonstrate how nudges can help stimulate employees to make healthier choices (e.g., stand-up working and healthy eating), support companies in reaching sustainability goals (e.g., energy-saving default settings), and uphold existing rules in a company (e.g., related to safety and hygiene).

Multi-centre clinical trials may be preferable to single-centre trials, but their implementation and management is more complex. EU-funded collaborative projects involve several participating organizations and countries and their consortia are typically multidisciplinary. Their coordination requires a joint effort from several actors, and an appropriate managerial structure and procedures need to be defined and established. The management of the Framework Programme 7 (FP7) PREVIEW project, whose core consisted of a clinical trial with 8 intervention centres/sites is presented as case study. PREVIEW was coordinated by the University of Copenhagen. The project management was implemented by a combination of decentralised project management, at the department level, jointly by the Project Coordinator (PC) and Project Manager (PM), and centralised, by a dedicated EU Liaison Officer from the Project Management Office (PMO). The Quality Manager role was undertaken by the PC, with support from selected consortium members. The Exploitation Manager role was assumed by the leader of the dissemination and exploitation work package. The Data Manager (DM) at the University of Copenhagen established and maintained a datahub for all data from the clinical trial. The General Assembly and Steering Committee were key decision bodies with regard to taking and implementing decisions. The Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) was formed by reputed external experts providing guidance and advice. The project website was the main channel to reach the general public. A password protected private section was used as internal repository for the project. Regular meetings at all levels were key to ensure good communication and collaboration among the project team. Appropriate attention to data management was given from the start. The privacy of personal data was ensured in accordance with national and EU regulations. The PC was also the Sponsor of the multi-centre clinical trial, and the PM served as the overall Clinical Trial Administrator. Each centre was led by a Principal Investigator (PI), running the trial together with the local daily responsible. The tasks and responsibilities for the clinical trial of the Coordinating Centre were shared between Copenhagen and Helsinki centres. The trial was overall led by the Clinical Trial Manager (CTM), who was the PI at the Helsinki centre. The local Independent Ethical Committees approved the protocol prior to the start of the intervention. One member of the SAB acted as Ethical Officer. The trial/study had an overall statistician. The Analyst role was shared among different people from the Copenhagen and Helsinki centres. The DM created and maintained database for the intervention and the Clinical Report Forms by using OpenClinica open source software. The staff in the intervention received training in Good Clinical Practices, the protocol and its procedures. The monitoring tasks were jointly undertaken by the Sponsor and the CTM. The documents from the Trial Master File were saved in the Internal Repository. A set of Standard Operation Procedures was defined. Meetings among all PIs, and within the Instructors’ Network were key in the success of the intervention. This case study aims at serving as guidance to coordinating researchers, both during the proposal preparation and project implementation phases, as well as to provide visibility and insight into the multi-faceted role of the project managers and administrators of such projects. © 2021, Society of Research Administrators International.

Our proposed approach can be used ‘with’ or ‘without’ FIM reference parts. In the reference part-based screening method, the process of part selection starts by identifying the most similar parts (from the end-user part libraries) to some reference parts, which can be produced by FIM, followed by part size classification and cluster analysis based on the importance factors. A multi-criteria decision-making approach is then used to rank the clusters and the parts within each cluster using a user-defined criteria. The identification process without using FIM reference part does not include comparison with the reference parts. In both methods, once the first set of potential parts have been identified, the cost of using FIM is calculated using the developed FIM cost model and compared with the production cost using a conventional manufacturing.

To compensate for these shortcomings, they collaborate with other enterprises and public organisations in development projects to build new relationships and capabilities. However, such projects are accompanied by tensions due to dissimilar goals, expectations, and institutional logics among the stakeholders. To date, the interaction between collaboration and tensions within rural development projects is an underexplored topic, and to address this gap, we investigate how such interactions in rural development projects fertilise or hinder stakeholder participation. This is done by comparing two cases from a rural development project and drawing on theory on stakeholder participation, collaboration, and tensions. Based on this, we found that project managers and their ability to form appreciative linkages, structures, and processual entities as well as to combine dialogue and compromises to lower behavioural, structural, and psychological tensions are key to increasing stakeholder participation. This finding shows that project managers are vital balancing mechanisms in multi-stakeholder rural development projects. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Birgit Leick, Susanne Gretzinger, and Teemu Makkonen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120026331

Together with this new concept, a catalog of different EA Smells has been published and a first prototype was developed. However, this prototype is limited to ArchiMate and is not able to assess models adhering to other EA modeling languages. Moreover, the prototype is not integrate-able with other EA tools. Therefore, we propose to enhance the extensible Graph-based Enterprise Architecture Analysis (eGEAA) platform that relies on Knowledge Graphs with EA Smell detection capabilities. To align these two approaches, we show in this paper, how ArchiMate models can be transformed into Knowledge Graphs and provide a set of queries on the Knowledge Graph representation that are able to detect EA Smells. This enables enterprise architects to assess EA Smells on all types of EA models as long as there is a Knowledge Graph representation of the model. Finally, we evaluate the Knowledge Graph based EA Smell detection by analyzing a set of 347 EA models. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Analysis; ArchiMate; Enterprise architecture; Knowledge graph; Model transformation","Graphic methods; Modeling languages; Odors; Analyse; Archimate; Architecture analysis; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise architecture modeling; Graph representation; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Model transformation; Quality flaws; Knowledge graph",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119831729

These can be seen as a specific category under the umbrella concept of Technical Debt (TD). TD is a central concept in software development projects and having the means to detect and measure the smells is important to understand impairments they may cause. However, TD is only limited to the technical aspects and does not describe smells found on an enterprise level. Enterprise Architecture Debt (EAD) expands the concepts of TD beyond the technical aspects such that it covers the debts that can be found in all layers of an Enterprise Architecture (EA). EA smells give a measurement for EAD, by providing means for detecting the smell, hence enabling a method to quantify the level of debt. The goal of this paper is to find EA smells derived from existing SA smells. This has resulted in three new EA smells that could be used as measurements for the quality of an EA. They can also be used in the future as a basis for automatic EA smell detection. © 2021 IEEE.",,"Enterprise software; Software design; Design problems; Enterprise Architecture; Internal structure; IS design; New enterprise; Software architectural; Software development projects; Technical aspects; Technical debts; Odors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119822953

Its theoretical contribution highlights governance as dependent on system integration dynamics, with lead firms operating as system integrators. The empirical analysis focuses on the interplay between energy and industrial policy showing how policy failure, driven by coal-based vested interests, disrupted system integration and undermined the renewable energy programme. The failure to ensure continuity and predictability of the auction bidding process within energy policy cascaded down the wind energy chain negatively impacting industrial policy attempts to localise domestic and foreign enterprises. This also derived from the South African government failing to prioritise, develop, and embed renewable energy as a green economy strategy within its industrial policy framework. We conclude with the following lessons: (a) GVC dynamics and lead firms cannot be ignored if localisation is to take root; (b) green strategies should be mainstreamed within industrial policy; (c) localisation starts with lead firms encouraging follower sourcing of first tier suppliers; (d) localising domestic value-added services is just as important as developing manufacturing enterprises. © 2021, Academy of International Business.","global value chains; green industrialisation; industrial policy; localisation; REIPPPP; wind renewable energy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119694365

Guidebook authors can choose to write about any aspects of a country's national culture, but we do not seem to know which aspects they chose to write about—that is, how comprehensive the guidebooks' depictions of culture are. In order to establish the comprehensiveness of contemporary guidebooks, a framework of cultural categories is developed based on theories about culture and intercultural communication. The method is content analysis of document data. In the empirical part of the study, three guidebooks about Denmark are examined quantitatively in order to establish how comprehensive their representation of the cultural values and cultural behavior categories of Denmark is. Based on the criteria set, travel guidebooks cannot be considered comprehensive. Readers should be aware that guidebooks only give a partial view of a destination's culture. With the increased availability of online hotel and restaurant resources for tourists, the publishers of travel guidebooks could expand the sections on national culture. This will increase readers' experiential value of the guidebooks and give guidebooks a competitive edge, whether the guidebooks are printed or digital. © 2021 Cognizant, LLC.

The findings of the paper are applicable to other jurisdictions, such as Denmark and Finland, as they are subject to similar conditions. Data centres are, when subject to the tax regime, subject to less than 2% of the normal electricity tax tariff. Multinational tech-giants benefit heavily from it while many domestic companies (colocation centres) are excluded due to its technical design and attached administrative case law. Initial calculations indicate there is tax savings of more than SEK 500 million (circa Euro 50 million) on an annual basis. Therefore, the tax regime acts as an international tax competition tool through its fiscal state aid function while, at the same time, eroding the tax bases and business life of northern Sweden. It does not initially appear to infringe on EU state aid rules nor the principle of non-discrimination. This Illustrates that there is still some margin of freedom for individual Member States to compete through tax measures. Additionally, tax policy objectives of the tax regime are considered and analysed. In particular, the impact it has had on not only international tax competition but also the economy of local municipalities, local business life, and progressive climate goals.

We designed three online experiments with strategies to motivate travelers to opt-in. We found travelers who receive concrete messages that emphasize specific actions are more likely to opt-in to VCOs when flying in the near future. In contrast, travelers receiving abstract messages that emphasize general initiatives are more likely to opt-in to VCOs when flying in the distant future. When travelers are allowed to choose their preferred carbon offset method, they are more likely to opt in, especially when they receive concrete messages that indicate specific actions but not general initiatives. These findings contribute to the aviation carbon offset literature and offer useful new insights for airline companies. © The Author(s) 2021.","aviation carbon emission; construal level; empowerment; voluntary carbon offset",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119441597

The rise of food festivals represents this trend. Food festivals have gained momentum for various entrepreneurs and producers, including farmers, fishermen, food manufacturers, food accessory producers, chefs, and restaurateurs. Much research is available on visitors (consumers) at food festivals, but knowledge about producers/vendors is almost absent. This study aims to bridge this research gap by reviewing and analyzing food producers’ entrepreneurial intentions to participate in food festivals and the role and meaning of festival participation in their professional and individual development. The study is inspired by ideas about artisan entrepreneurship. It draws empirically on primary data from 58 in-depth interviews among vendors at three food festivals organized in Poland in the summer of 2020. The results show that food festivals offer creative ways to discover and exploit business opportunities where lifestyle and altruistic values can feasibly coexist with business goals. However, the study also reveals that some food producers/vendors are reluctant to change their product or marketing approaches or to redirect their entrepreneurial orientations based on the feedback received at the festivals and on the dilemmas they face. This study elaborates on the nature of such challenges and proposes policy recommendations to overcome them. © 2021 The Author(s).

Yet, our knowledge about how ERM affects performance and interacts with corporate strategy-making processes is limited. The ERM frameworks impose first and second lines of defense practices to integrate business operations and corporate risk oversight. Emergent strategies generate responsive initiatives and strategic planning coordinates updated actions. Hence, this study analyzes the conjoint effects of these ERM practices and strategy-making processes based on a large corporate sample and finds that ERM practices depend on strategy-making to attain effective risk outcomes. The application of ERM frameworks can, therefore, not be assessed in isolation, but must consider corporate strategy-making. This has implications for the way we conduct research on strategic risk management, how executives approach risk oversight and policy-makers impose formal risk governance requirements. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic capabilities; Emergent strategy; Enterprise risk management (ERM); First line of defense (1LoD); Operating units; Risk oversight; Second line of defense (2LoD); Strategic planning","Risk management; Risks; Strategic planning; Corporate strategies; Dynamics capability; Emergent strategies; Enterprise risk management; First line of defense (1lod); Making process; Operating units; Risk oversight; Second line of defense (2lod); Network security",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119115617

The scaling was necessary because other design criteria influence the design as well. The cross-section of the bridge is a closed steel box. Structural reliability analysis was performed in which detailed consideration was given to stochastic modelling of resistance and load variables and of their associated uncertainties. Emphasis was placed on accurate and appropriate modelling of the considered limit states as well as on the traffic loading on the structure. In this regard weigh-in-motion data was employed to develop site-specific live loading models for comparison with design models and load effects. In this way the sensitivity of design assumptions and their influence on the implied safety was assessed. The detailed sensitivities of wind-induced section forces from a full dynamic analysis are utilized, and appropriate stochastic models have been found for the influencing parameters. The paper details all aspects of the reliability analysis and provides information on the evaluated implied safety level of the bridge deck. The results of the sensitivity analysis are instructive in understanding the influence of uncertainties on the results, especially the parameters used in the wind-induced response analysis and the assumptions of the traffic load model. © 2021 IABSE Congress, Ghent 2021: Structural Engineering for Future Societal Needs.

However, the comparisons between this method and the conventional “Ritter” method shows that for certain prerequisites it would result in substantial different load-bearing capacity. Hence, in order to investigate how support conditions influence the load bearing capacity of the wall, this study performs a nonlinear numerical analysis of a wall for several load cases in ABAQUS and the result is verified with an independently developed calculation tool using MATLAB. The results show that the top rotation plays a significant role for the load bearing capacity of the masonry wall supported by slabs at both ends.

The task of this working group is to create benchmark results for the validation of methodologies and software programs developed to assess the stability and the buffeting response of long span bridges. Indeed, accurate estimations of structural stability and response to strong winds are critical for the successful design of long-span bridges. While the first results of the benchmark, dealing with a section approach, have been already published, in this paper the ongoing activity and results of the task group are presented. The topic of these results is the numerical response of a full-bridge model under the actions of a multi-correlated wind field both in terms of aeroelastic stability and buffeting response. © 2021 IABSE Congress, Ghent 2021: Structural Engineering for Future Societal Needs.

The empirical stance within organization studies thereby comes to revolve around organization as a claim made in empirical inquiries. The presumption of non-organization takes the legal principle of presumption of innocence as its paradigm. It works by placing the burden of proof on the empirical inquiries to establish, beyond a reasonable doubt, that what is inquired into is an instance of organization (where organization may be understood in terms of organizing, organization of something, formal organization, etc.). Organization scholars may assume organization – and often for good reasons – when making a restaurant, a market, or something else object of inquiry. However, adopting the presumption of non-organization requires organization studies to make explicit what is understood by organization as well as what findings are mobilized to establish the claim that organization, in the sense subscribed to, is found. Hereby the presumption of non-organization reinforces the empirical stance as ‘a recurrent rebellion against the metaphysicians’ (van Fraassen). Metaphysics is not cancelled out by empirical inquiry, as it may be part and parcel of assumptions that inform empirical inquiry, and the presumption of non-organization calls for a recurrent test of such assumptions. © The Author(s) 2021.","communicative constitution of organizations (CCO); empirical stance; empiricism; formal organization; identification; object of inquiry; organization studies",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118901271

A cluster analysis of a sample of 706 U.S. adult luxury consumers reveals five segments of luxury consumers, each reflecting a specific persona, that engage in both ethical and ethical luxury consumption to varying extents. The five segments differ in the extent to which they exhibit features related to four discriminant functions (immorality, ego-orientation, and strain; altruistic-orientation; conservation, in control, and positivity; and youth and luxury savvy), which vary across the biological, socio-psychological, and structural drivers. The findings thus indicate which segments of luxury consumers are most relevant for luxury firms pursuing a long-term sustainability agenda and suggest practical actions to reach those goals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Ethical luxury consumption; Luxury consumption; Persona",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118685648

This is a radical change for the construction sector which has for a long time considered the management of waste as not been part of the tasks of the industry. Demolishing and recycling activities, usually considered as low value work, now received a renewed attention and construction companies are slowly developing new business propositions to include the reuse of waste. Building on the ongoing discussion on green business models, following Teece, we define business model as a 'model' which represents the organisational and financial 'architecture' of a business and includes implicit assumptions about customers, their needs, and the behaviour of revenues, costs, and competitors. Instead of focusing on innovation as an internal process, we understand this development as a dynamic process stretching outside company boundaries. Building on a longitudinal study of construction companies (2017-2020) active in the southwest part of Sweden, we propose to give an insight in how these companies are engaged in developing new business propositions focusing on circular economy, how these propositions have emerged and how they could be transformed in new businesses. The empirical material draws on a qualitative study of 11 companies gathering interviews with 35 practitioners, five sites visits and three observations of meetings and workshop. Our contribution aims at informing how the companies, investing in the dynamic processes of business models, can support innovation in the construction industry and participate to the development of circular economy but also to document what are the main challenges they face in doing so. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

The concept has gained momentum among politicians and academics; however, it is only slowly penetrating the sector. In the paper, we aim at developing our understanding of how this concept is translated into specific organisational settings. Rather than focusing on the actions to support or prevent its dissemination, we focus on how the concept is brought into life as an organisational practice and through which processes and mechanism. Drawing on qualitative data from primarily interviews, we present a case study of two large Scandinavian contractors' efforts to implement CB. The results point at a diversity of positions and choices in translating CB within a specific organisational context. The concept of translation helps us to analyse the shaping of such processes and may consequently contribute to the development of the CB concept by directing attention to how circular ideas and concepts are translated across different contexts. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

This calls for new types of societal planning and governance. In Sweden both architectural and design developer competitions is in use. In design developer competitions, the public client has allocated a particular piece of land, and requests responses to certain possibilities and limitations. The participants are developers or contractors who aim to develop business through winning the competition and constructing buildings on the land. The question is whether design developer competitions can deliver more sustainable housing at a fair cost. Theories of innovation, sustainable transition, and governance all contribute to the framework of understanding. The method is a critical reading and analysis of two design developer competitions scrutinizing them for sustainability aspects. All steps of the competitions, program, competition, jury verdict, and implementation, involve particular dilemmas for the actors. Sustainability aspects vary widely from singular to comprehensive solutions, reflecting a dilemma between creative designs versus controlled outcome.

Understanding these practices are essential as prequalification and bidding represent the two most important competitive parameters for contractor firms. However, little is known about the actual prequalification practices and bidding practices at contractor firms due to the sensitivity and confidentiality of the subject. The purpose of this paper is to investigate through activity theory how practices of prequalification and bidding in contractor firms may support or hinder a circular transformation of refurbishment and new building. It is based on an integrative literature review that will review, critically appraise, and synthesise representative literature in an integrated way to generate new frameworks and perspectives on the research question. The study points at the barriers and levers for a circular transition of contractor firms. The main findings are related to five central dilemmas that contractor firms are facing in the process towards circular prequalification and bidding practices identified from the activity system. The five dilemmas include: 1) scalability within the organisation and knowledge sharing, 2) interpretation of sustainable requirements, 3) narrow profit margin and poor business cases, 4) underdeveloped circular markets and 5) the traditional practices of tendering. In conclusion, this paper will generate new insights on prequalification and bidding practices for both researchers and practitioners into the possibilities and obstacles for renewing the building industry and transforming it towards a circular future. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

One way to achieve this goal is by choosing alternative building materials, particularly by using more wood in buildings. Research shows that wood is still not used broadly in the Danish building sector, compared to neighbouring countries, due to design traditions, legislation barriers, and lack of experiences and solutions. Thus, this study investigates the Danish construction sector's current status and attitudes towards using wood in buildings, identifying the perceived barriers and benefits. A nationwide survey was collected from 155 respondents, including engineers, architects, municipalities, and professional building owners. The results indicate that actors have a positive mindset towards using wood and recognize its benefits, revealing that 15 % of actors use wood frequently in their projects, and 52 % are interested in this transition. However, numerous technical aspects must be solved, e.g., risk of fire and moisture. Building owners are the most prominent influencers to promote using wood and are responsible for progressing broader sustainability goals.

Business models for Industrialised Housebuilding, often start with prefabrication. With the rapid growth of sustainability demands and circular construction as an uprising theme, a central question is, what is the sustainability element in Swedish industrialized housebuilders business models regarding MSHT? Sustainable transition theory is adopted. The method is a desk study of existing research, websites, annual reports and other material. The sustainability element in the business models of industrialized house builders is explored, with focus on circular construction. MSHT is described as reducing environmental impact compared to concrete and provides social values, enabling its diffusion, however with less apparent cost advantages. However, with the growth of circular thinking, IH may have potential to further develop. The findings show that sustainability is overall present in the development of IH within MSHT, where the companies show a homogenous picture with varying challenges and contribute to sustainable transition. Regarding circular construction, the study shows potential in additional steps needed from a life-cycle perspective. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

The construction industry holds great potential for contributing to achieving the goals towards 2030. This study investigates the current state of implementation of the SDGs within the Danish construction industry, both on a strategic and project specific level. It provides insights into the barriers for implementation. A survey was distributed to actors within the construction industry and responded by 54 people, involving architects, engineers, building owners, contractors, suppliers and manufacturers, along with academic experts. The results indicate that 90% agree that the SDGs can add value to construction project, and 79% had implemented the SDGs on a strategic level. 45% had worked with the SDGs on a project level, where the goals 7 (clean and affordable energy), 12 (responsible consumption) and 13 (climate action) were most often applied. The main barriers to implementing the SDGs were a lack of measurability, time, and resources. The prioritization of goals was discussed in the light of previous research. This study provides valuable insights into the current state of implementation of the SDGs in the Danish construction industry and points towards the following directions for future research: 1) further development of tools and methods to support the actors within the construction industry, especially focusing on measurability and prioritization, 2) indepth investigation of the state of implementation of the SDGs for the different actors within the construction industry, and, lastly, 3) further studies on the challenges and barriers for implementing the goals within the construction industry. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

Empirical data from four weeks of fieldwork in different settings (e.g., training, school, residence), and semi-structured interviews with different social actors (e.g., players, coaches and managers) were explored and compared through the principles of thematic analysis. Using Schein’s conceptualisation of organisational culture as the theoretical lens for the research, we identified similarities and differences of the talent development structure and culture. Specific for the professional club, coaches selected players who “fitted into their system”, collaborated with the schools to organise the players’ everyday life, the club took responsibility for the players’ wellbeing and established daily routines for the players. In the volunteer-based club, the players took responsibility for their own wellbeing and daily routines and stressed that success is achieved through autonomous decisions, and the coaches’ awareness of player differences was a means for facilitating talent development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","athlete development; autonomy support; cultural leadership; holistic ecological approach; Talent development environment; youth sport",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118423930

A significant part of Danish building regulations' requirements is currently regulated by having a new sustainability building class to boost the green transformation of construction. One of the new sustainability requirements is to save resources by promoting circularity at construction sites. Thus, this study investigates Danish construction organizations' readiness and willingness to use the new sustainability building class to establish sustainable construction sites, focusing on circular solutions. It considers actors' understanding and current level of implementing sustainability principles and circular strategies and highlights the perceived challenges and actors' practical experiences. A qualitative and quantitative survey was collected from 146 actors, including contractors, engineers, architects, and professional building owners. Results reveal the awareness of sustainability in construction sites, as 32 % of organizations use sustainable onsite principles with various levels of experience, and 85 % are willing to use circular solutions. Lack of expertise and economy are perceived as significant challenges when establishing sustainable construction sites. Many actors are still unaware of the relevant rules and do not have a specific strategy to manage waste and perceive this topic with high risk and uncertain benefits. © 2021 Proceedings of the 37th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2021.

In theory, training in leadership and experience across government levels and policy areas should help both women and men to climb management ranks. We use logistic regression to test this proposition using a representative sample of 1,819 Danish public managers. We find that leadership training disproportionately benefits women, and this helps to level the playing field.

One well-cited theoretical account for this attractiveness effect (White et al., 2013) holds that it reflects an adaptive psychological response to disease threats. Voters are predicted to upregulate preferences for attractiveness because it constitutes a cue to health. The global COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an ecologically relevant and realistic setting for further testing this prediction. Here, we report the results from six tests of the prediction based on two large and nationally representative surveys conducted in Denmark (n = 3297) at the outbreak of the pandemic and one year later. Utilizing experimental techniques, validated individual difference measures of perceived disease threat and geographic data on COVID-19 severity, we do not find that disease threats like the COVID-19 pandemic upregulate preferences for attractive and healthy political or non-political leaders. Instead, respondents display heightened preferences for health in socially proximate relations (i.e. colleagues). Moreover, individuals who react aversively to situations involving risks of pathogen transmission (scoring high in Germ Aversion) report higher importance of a wide range of leadership traits, rather than for health and attractiveness in particular.

Design/methodology/approach: The research is theoretically rooted in a conceptual development of the understanding of entrepreneurial learning processes as abductive reasoning inspired by the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. The theoretical explication of the connection between entrepreneurial learning processes and abductive reasoning is additionally illustrated by a hypotheses-based didactic model, developed by the authors to scaffold abducting reasoning into learning processes. Findings: The authors found in the theoretical investigation of abductive reasoning a conceptualisation of entrepreneurial learning processes that connects entrepreneurial learning processes to basic cognitive human competences, and the authors found that key concepts in entrepreneurship, such as hunches and experiments, can be understood in a broader philosophical framework as basic cognitive competences. Practical implications: The authors exemplify how abductive reasoning can be used in practice through a hypothesis-based didactic approach designed as a loop model. Originality/value: The authors have discovered that abduction is closely related to entrepreneurship and can be a central conceptual link in understanding the relationship between entrepreneurship and learning. The athors also believe that Peirce's concept of abduction can contribute to the philosophical understanding of entrepreneurship as another name for a constant rethinking of the world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abduction; Education; Entrepreneurial learning; Entrepreneurship; Hypothesis-based didactic; Peirce",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118099946

In the Nordic countries, HBR has been introduced as an innovative care model within the municipal health care sector that answers the need for better and more effective service delivery. But knowledge about how innovations can be spread in the municipal health care sector is scarce. We also know little about what role first-line managers (FLMs) may play for the diffusion of innovations. Purpose: To describe and explain adoption of HBR in municipalities in Norway and to explore if there is a relationship between early/late adoption and the FLM’s perception of innovativeness in their organization. Such knowledge is valuable for the understanding of the role of FLM for the diffusion of innovations in the health care sector. Methods: A cross-sectional national online survey was carried out among FLM in the eldercare sector in 422 Norwegian municipalities. The response rate was 64%. The analysis was based on univariate and bivariate techniques, factor analysis, and multiple linear regression. Results: A bivariate analysis revealed that early adoption is associated with a high score on perception of innovativeness among FLMs. Innovators and early adopters scored highest (5.65) on perception of innovativeness, followed by early majority (5.31) and late majority (5.18). The lowest score was found among Laggards. A multiple regression analysis revealed that a substantial part of the positive relationship between early adoption and perception of innovativeness can be explained by FLMs’ length of service in the organization and their educational level. Wealth of the municipality does not have an effect on innovativeness. Conclusion: An implication of the results is that mature and stable personnel in key positions in the organization, and personnel with higher education, can be positive for innovativeness in the municipal health care sector. © 2021 Bliksvær et al.","Diffusion of innovations; Elderly care; Health care service; Innovativeness; Restorative care","adoption; article; bivariate analysis; diffusion of innovation; educational status; elderly care; factor analysis; health care cost; human; human experiment; manager; Norway; perception; subacute care; tertiary education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117754271

The main contribution of this chapter is to demonstrate how, by taking an event-based view, the two types of change may be integrated with one another. Continuous change takes place in the present as events in the making, whereas episodic change is marked by events in the past or as projected upon the future. This endogenous view of time as events “from within” enables the ontological gap between episodic and continuous change to be bridged.

The recultivation of some abandoned farmlands could unlock the untapped agricultural potential. Yet, little is known about the determinants of recultivation. To better understand the behavioral intentions of farmers regarding the recultivation of abandoned lands, we concentrated on the Buryat Republic in Russia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread and farmers with different ethnicities carry out diverse agricultural practices. We conducted 149 face-to-face interviews with the farmers in the Buryat Republic in 2018 and filled a structured questionnaire on farm's and farmers' socioeconomic characteristics, perceived corruption, and farmers' behavioral intentions regarding expected land use. We modeled the intention of recultivation with the Bayesian networks. The Bayesian networks analysis showed that perceived corruption was considered to be a barrier to recultivation. Our study also showed that non-Buryat ethnic and young farmers are more likely to recultivate abandoned land. Abandoned farmlands without or with a low degree of afforestation were preferred for recultivation. In sum, our study showed how behavioral aspects of political trust, the farm's and farmer's characteristics, in combination with regional and locational characteristics, may shape farmers' decisions on land use. The results provide an important ground to assess regional land-use policies, which should foster the recultivation of abandoned lands while preserving ecosystem services in the global hotspots of farmland abandonment, such as Russia. © 2015 Interregional public organization Association of infectious disease specialists of Saint-Petersburg and Leningrad region (IPO AIDSSPbR).

The qualitative approach was applied to investigate the phenomena in real-life settings. Twenty-eight interviews were conducted from organic shoppers in specialized organic food markets. Data were analyzed from detailed parts to categories, themes, dimensions, and codes. Finding shows that organic food buyers are well aware of organic food benefits by virtue of its production methods. Although there are similarities in results between certified and non-certified organic food, however, many unique themes such as subcategories of health motives, various dimensions of trust, role of sales person, inelastic price, role of organic food cues, deceptive marketing, etc. are explored. Based on consumption motives, several categories of organic food consumers are also reported. The research has contributed to the literature by offering a consumer decision map that depicts important factors that play a vital role in the purchase of non-certified organic food. The pragmatic insight offered in this study can assist growers, enterprises, and policy makers in developing consumer understanding especially in ninety two other countries operating without organic food regulations.

Encouragingly, the recent trend of digital transformation, adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies (I4Ts), could significantly improve business processes extenuating potential risks and disruptions. Yet, there is a paucity of quantitative studies on the risk or disruption mitigation and I4Ts, specifically on agri-food industry. Using a sample of 302 firms from the Australian agri-food supply chains, we explore if the firms that adopt I4Ts experience the different impact of operational risks (supply-demand mismatch, financial and transportation) compared to others. The findings unveil that albeit such risks can significantly undermine firm performance, their negative effect is non-significant for the firms that adopt I4Ts compared to those that do not adopt.

Design/methodology/approach: Constructivist grounded theory study based on 15 semi-structured interviews with first- and third-year nursing students in clinical internships at somatic hospital wards was used. Findings: The authors identified two themes around organizational alienation. Temporaries expected and hoped to experience resonance in their interactions with permanent members, which drove them to make an extra effort when confronted with permanents’ relational indifference. Temporaries felt insignificant, meaningless and unworthy, causing them to adopt a relationless mode of relating, feeling alienated and adapting their expectations and hopes. Practical implications: Relational indifference is, unlike relational repulsion, problematic to target directly through intervention policies as organizations would inflict a more profound alienation on temporaries. Originality/value: Unlike previous research on blended workgroups, which has predominantly focused on relational repulsion, this paper contributes to understanding how relational indifference affects temporaries’ mode of relating to permanent. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Blended workgroups; Organizational alienation; Organizational ostracism; Resonance; Temporary work; Temporary workers",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116383924

By inventing a tertius typology representing six archetypes of organization-creative action and strategies inherent in all innovative and entrepreneurial firm development, intermediation and entrepreneuring are seen as interwoven processes constantly emerging, evolving and interacting in multilayered contexts and dynamics of organisation-creation.

It draws on a three-year interinstitutional project that aimed at disseminating active pedagogy among in-service teachers in Latin America, and it presents the case of a Brazilian university, where the project was implemented. Findings show that reflecting on concrete cases regarding local social issues triggered students’ empathy and fostered proactive attitudes. By using reflection-based active pedagogy, participant teachers developed a higher level of awareness about their need for constant self-assessment.

Drawing on a qualitative study of an award-winning sustainability pioneer in the cosmetics sector, we explore the role of moral judgement in how and when employees interpret word–deed misalignment in CSR implementation as hypocritical. First, our case reveals that high CSR aspirations by companies raise employees’ moral expectations. Second, we develop a framework that explains variations in employees’ hypocrisy interpretations based on consequentialist and deontological forms of moral judgement. Our research advances a contextual view of hypocrisy, not as an objective characteristic of an organisation, but as an outcome of interpretative processes of perceived motives and results in CSR implementation.

Given the dynamic and constantly changing nature of sales, researchers have also explored the influence of technology, such as the internet, email, and social media, on the overall selling process. While most of these articles have been conceptual, they have largely focused on the selling process as it occurs in the U.S. and other developed Western markets. These insights, which have certainly proven to be impactful, neglect to consider differences that may exist in emerging markets, as lessons from the U.S. may not unequivocally translate to such markets. Although extant research acknowledges the cultural and economic differences that exist between developed and emerging markets, little is known about the applicability and implementation of the seven-step selling process in the latter, where resources are much more limited and salespeople may not always have access to the same selling tools or level of sales support. As such, and in accordance with recent calls in the literature, this research comprised an in-depth investigation into the personal selling that takes place in emerging markets as well as the implementation and the processes involved. Specifically, we conducted in-depth interviews with professional salespeople operating in emerging markets to obtain first-hand experiences of selling process.

Overall, our findings revealed that, although there are similarities to the selling process in developed markets, there are important differences in in terms of the activities, challenges, and issues salespeople face. © Fernando Jaramillo and Jay Prakash Mulki 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115764090

The loss of orders from global retailers in developed economies has worsened the living conditions for many garment-industry workers in emerging economies, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and Vietnam. Many suppliers in these countries have remained locked into relatively low-value, low-margin, low-skilled activities. However, in a relatively little noticed phenomenon, some suppliers have been able to upgrade their capabilities and have internationalized, establishing facilities abroad to strengthen ties to existing buyers. The contributions to this book document this phenomenon, highlighting the factors that promote or hinder higher levels of internationalization, the conditions that influence the development of suppliers’ capabilities, and how some firms achieve higher levels of sustainable production. They do so from various perspectives, including international business, global value chain, strategy, innovation, operations management and sociological perspectives. Together the book’s chapters represent an important contribution to the literature, focusing on important aspects of GVCs using firm-centric analysis that the existing literature tends to downplay. By enabling us to understand those challenges better, those contributions can help to provide ways for suppliers to overcome them. Collectively, therefore, we hope the chapters in this book offer a positive message for suppliers, multinational buyers, and workers within GVCs during a time of unprecedented challenges. © Mohammad B.

Inspired by new materialist theory, we challenge the common understanding of talent as something an athlete either is or has by examining talent as a relational phenomenon, residing in the dynamic relationship between athlete and coach. The article is based on interviews with 60 talented athletes aged 13–16 years from a Danish talent development programme. We found three key practices that shape the coach-athlete-relationship: practices that render the talent visible, practices that build or disrupt agency and practices that affect the athletes’ commitment. The analysis shows that coaches have a position that can either promote or inhibit access to and participation in talent development environments. A relational approach to talent opens for ethical discussions of power and responsibility in talent development. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","athlete-coach-relationships; dual career; new materialism; talent development; talent in the making",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115675292

Furthermore, we integrate non-work role-referencing to test the stereotype confirmation assumption underlying the representativeness heuristic.

Background: It is expected, that working conditions for COVID-19-pandemic frontline staff will change, as health care organizations have gained experience with handling the consequences of the disease. Methods: An online survey was sent out to Danish health care leaders during the first and the second pandemic wave. Comparative analyses were performed in relation to three key characteristics: management level, management education and experiences as a leader. Results: Eighty-nine health care leaders completed both surveys. Significant differences were found within the entire group across the key characteristics as they felt more prepared for each stage of the situation, they had more influence on the decisions taken, and they felt more concerned about the quality of treatment and care and their own health. Further significant results related to the three key characteristics were found at 1) Management level: The heads of department experienced being better informed, having more overview of their tasks and that these were meaningful. The ward managers experienced being more able to work in consistency with own beliefs and values, though they felt more overloaded. 2) Level of management education: Leaders, without a formal management education, experienced being more supported by staff. 3) Years of experiences as leader: Leaders with more than five years of experience, experienced being more prepared and informed, had more influence on decision-making, and were more worried about their own health. Conclusion: The learning from experience that happens naturally in crisis situations is the reason why the leaders feel more prepared. However, there is a need for further leadership and practice development, to create contexts where leaders feel more ready for all aspects of their role. © 2021 Hølge-Hazelton et al.","Clinical leadership; Communication; Follow-up; Management; Online survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115270236

To sharpen identification, we analyze several sources of cross-sectional variation in these patterns, the degree of competition, and the sign and the source of reserves changes. We also exploit two plausibly exogenous shocks: the tightening of the O&G reserve disclosure rules and the introduction of fracking technology. Additional tests more directly focused on the presence of proprietary costs confirm that the mandated reserve disclosures result in a relative loss of competitive edge for announcing firms.

Whereas the literature so far has primarily studied political, organizational and individual antecedents of turnover, we focus on the relational level. Based on homosocial reproduction, relational demography and social identify theory, we hypothesize that demographic similarities between senior executives and their political counterparts influence executive turnover. Using longitudinal register data of Danish mayors and chief administrative officers (CAOs), our results suggest that gender dissimilarity (specifically, a male mayor and a female CAO) increases the risk of CAO turnover. Similarly, the risk of CAO turnover is higher when the CAO is older than the mayor. Contrary to expectations, however, differences in education reduces turnover risk (specifically when the CAO has more education than the mayor). Our study illustrates the relevance of understanding turnover as a relational phenomenon based on factors beyond rational, political, and functional explanations. © Copyright © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114633652

Building on insights from social psychology, this article argues that citizens spontaneously make impressions of the warmth (e.g., friendliness) and competence (e.g., effectiveness) of the public employee with whom they interact. Utilizing two large-scale randomized survey experiments, conducted in Denmark and the United States, this study demonstrates that impressions of warmth and competence in a concrete interaction with a public employee have important effects on general trust in civil servants. The findings further provide evidence that a single case experience can have implications for trust in broader administrative and political institutions of government.

Drawing on the resource-based view, we hypothesise that families especially often are motivated by opportunity. Representative samples of family and non-family businesses in Egypt, Madagascar, Morocco and Turkey reported on motives for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor survey. Motive and governance are found to be coupled, in that family businesses, more than non-family businesses, tend to be motivated by opportunity. Moreover, this coupling is found in all four societies, and to be of similar strength in all four, suggesting that the coupling may be globally universal for similar contexts.

Specifically, exporting may differ between family and nonfamily businesses. Exporting is also influenced by context and varies among countries; the difference in exporting between family and non-family businesses may differ among countries. Accordingly, our questions are: how does export differ between family and non-family businesses in developing countries, and how do developing contexts moderate the effects of family vs. non-family governance upon exporting? (1) A representative sample of 3726 firms in Egypt, Madagascar, Morocco and Turkey has been surveyed for the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. (2) In Egypt, Madagascar and Turkey, family governance does not affect firms' exporting; however, Moroccan family businesses export more than Moroccan non-family counterparts. Thus, the institutional context in Morocco is especially conducive for exporting by family businesses. (3) These findings contribute to understanding how family and non-family businesses differ in exporting, moderated by developing contexts.

The authors argue that this is a fundamental and often overlooked prerequisite for industrial transformation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a process study of 33 small- and medium-sized companies engaged in the transformation of a manufacturing industry from the different perspectives of manufacturers or manufacturing solution providers. Findings: Key findings indicate a strong link between the specific competence development approach, the specific intricacies of the application domain and the process outcomes. On this basis, a competence development framework is proposed. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions are drawn from a Danish population of companies in the manufacturing industry and are based on particular contingencies, such as low volume/high mix, high skill, low tech and high cost. However, the findings are believed to be applicable across different sets of contingencies where the need to combine legacy and emerging technologies is present, and where the human factor is central to leveraging technology beyond predefined supplier specifications. Practical implications: In a time of extraordinary investments in the manufacturing of technologies in support of digital transformation, the development of strategic and operational competences to support these investments is lagging behind. This paper develops a conceptual outset for closing this gap. Originality/value: The research is based on the fundamental argument that to efficiently apply new technology, a strategic approach to the acquisition of new knowledge and skills is required. The empirical research demonstrates that new skills and knowledge are often assumed to follow automatically from the use of new technologies. However, we demonstrate that this perspective in fact limits the ability to capture the potential benefits ascribed to I4.0 technologies. The authors propose that the competence strategy needs to be expansive and cover not only the technological competences but also the organizational- and individual-level competences. These results add to our understanding of how the digital transformation of manufacturing companies unfolds. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Competence strategies; Industry 4.0; Learning; Manufacturing companies; Qualitative",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113803935

One type of work unit that naturally faces both physical and social distance is the Global Virtual Teams (GVT). While distance has been debated in the GVT literature, there is still a scarcity of research on how to deal with distance related problems. Guided by organizational discontinuity theory, we explore the effect of individual-level approaches to overcoming physical distance (time zone adjustment) and social distance (trust in peers) in GVTs. In addition, we assess how these mechanisms are affected by the team context in the form of openness to cultural diversity. We do this by studying 23 GVTs (171 team members and 23 team leaders) in the global R&D department of a Danish engineering company. Our findings demonstrate that trust in peers is positively associated with job role clarity and job performance at the individual-level, and that high team openness to diversity, in the case of performance, makes the individual’s level of trust in peers less necessary for achieving performance. Our results also show that time zone adjustment increases job role clarity for the individual team member, but only in GVTs with high openness to cultural diversity. Based on this, we contribute to the organizational discontinuity theory by demonstrating how continuity-creating mechanisms can interact with the team context to ultimately support the individual’s potential for handling distance in GVTs. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","distance; Global virtual teams; openness to diversity; time zones; trust",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113737548

The transformation is motivated and enabled by end-to-end business intelligence related to processes revolving around the product’s design, configuration and engineering. The investigation builds on case-based research following the company’s decision of converting its product portfolio to only one family of products, thus increasing process efficiency whilst at the same time enlarging its market reach by offering individualized and innovative products. By digitally integrating operations related to sales, product development and production preparation, the traditional trade-off between cost-effective solutions with high product variety and low lead-time is significantly reduced. Design/methodology/approach: A design science research project has been conducted to create knowledge on the effects of integration across the value-adding chain of operations. Several design cycles illustrate how development based on business intelligence and available technological enablers for inter-operation integration influence the traditional approach towards supply chain pipeline selection strategies. Findings: Relating to digital transformation, the consequences and means of adopting digital business intelligence for integrating several administrative and engineering operations in small-medium enterprises (SME) are studied. The product delivery performance of the SME is improved, thus, having ETO lead-time comparable to manufacturing to order company. The findings show how the adoption of state-of-the-art technological solutions for cross-operation digital integration challenges traditional supply chain, coordination models. Research limitations/implications: The conclusions are drawn based on a single case. The limitations associated with case-based research call for further work to support generalization. Furthermore, the long-term influence of the effects of increased interoperability on supply chain coordination strategies requires further investigation. Practical implications: As technological solutions evolve, new opportunities for supply chain management arise, which put into question the traditional understanding that complex supply chain pipeline characteristics should be handled by complexity reducing initiatives, which opens up new competitive opportunities for companies in high-cost countries. Social implications: Enabling the use of human resources towards expanding the business (rather than running it only) are aligned with the current economic and political situation in high-cost countries like Denmark and potentially releases skilled employees from repetitive and low value-adding work and reengages them in business development. Originality/value: By embracing flexibility and volatility as an opportunity, this publication exemplifies how to move beyond hedging the supply chain volatility, but systematically enable the supply chain to deal with complexity efficiently. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Both; Configuration; Interoperability; Manufacturing configuration; Product configuration; Supply chain; Supply chain coordinated strategy; Supply chain strategy selection; Technology; Transition; Value-adding chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113621815

The purpose of this study is to examine how it is possible to combine SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) with Presetting systems (anticipation of tools or devices adjustments) to improve production systems’ productivity in practice. First, a literature review was performed to expand the understanding of SMED-related methods and the current knowledge gaps in the relevant literature. Next, a revitalised method combining SMED with Presetting systems was proposed and empirically validated in close collaboration with the industry in a longitudinal study. Qualitative and quantitative observations made before, during and after the intervention demonstrated the adequate performance of the tested method. The main results obtained include (i) 87% reduction in the setup time and a 33.8% increase in the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of the labelling machine, (ii) 17% increase in the entire line’s OEE, (iii) about 45% reduction of the lot sizes, (iv) a systemic improvement in productivity of 48.533 parts per month into production line responsible for 90.5% of the company’s revenues. Overall, this study proposed theory refinements and contributes to research and practice on Lean Production implementation by expanding and revitalising the current literature on setup reduction methods and process improvements. The refined method and the prescriptive guidelines provided in this study enable industrial practitioners to increase production systems’ performance in practice.

Recently, the power of blockchain, with its capacity to provide full transactional disclosure and thereby reduce uncertainty, insecurity, and ambiguity in transactions, has been touted as being a game changer in the fight against corruption. Based on a study of the global shipping industry, we find that blockchain mitigates both process and document-related corruption. Based on these findings, we develop an understanding of how corruption may be combated using both social and digital/informational resources, including blockchain technology.

Given this unique nature, the century-old challenge in the insurance industry is to effectively reduce transaction costs among the stakeholders while maintaining business privacy and trust. Although blockchain is a promising technology to mitigate this challenge, two technical issues, namely (1) inefficiency in data auditing and (2) difficulty in verifying encrypted data, are of strategic importance when applying blockchain to the insurance industry. To address these technical challenges, we propose an innovative blockchain-based technical model, InsurModel, in the context of newly initiated long-term care insurance in China. Specifically, we utilize cryptographical methods including “zero-knowledge-proof” to 1) represent business interdependence and 2) verify confidential business information without disclosure of specifics. We demonstrate the scalability and applicability of InsurModel and explore its strategic implications in constraining adverse behaviors of the stakeholders. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","blockchain application; blockchain in insurance; business interdependence; Long-term care insurance; transaction-cost economics; zero-knowledge proof","Blockchain; Cryptography; Health insurance; Business information; Encrypted data; Insurance industry; Privacy and trusts; Technical challenges; Technical models; Transaction cost; Zero knowledge proof; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112674360

In this article, it is argued that the allocation should continue to be justified by the principle of economic allegiance in accordance with the ability of the MNEs to pay taxes.

However, on the basis of a multidimensional institutional perspective of publicness, which includes authority, funding, and values, one can quickly understand that the publicness of organizations comes in various guises. This institutional perspective not only explains the behavior of these various public service organizations themselves but also the behavior of individuals operating within these institutional boundaries. Key to explaining individual institutional behavior is the concept of identities. Depending on the extent of their internalization, identities influence individual behavior more or less strongly. An important level at which these insights can be harnessed to the benefit of the organization is at the level of management, which is the link between the individual and the organization. The mechanisms of management influence are illustrated by analyzing four different organizational systems (work design, reward, human resources flow, and employee participation) to manage human assets in public service organizations. © the several contributors 2021.","Human resources; Institutions; Management; Multilevel analysis; Public service identities; Publicness",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111891616

This is the overall question of this volume. The sixteen chapters aim to clarify conceptual issues; critically reflect on assumptions underlying public management and public service performance understandings; theoretically explain direct and indirect relationships between management and performance; and outline a research agenda based on a review of the extant literature. In order to achieve these aims, this volume takes a multidisciplinary, critical, rigorous, and context-sensitive approach. The disciplines of public management, leadership, human resource management, and work and organization psychology are combined because they focus differently on aspects of management, public service performance, employee outcomes, and linking mechanisms such as employees’ attitudes and behaviors. Multidisciplinarity is illustrated by the variety of management aspects examined: different types of leadership behaviors, people management, performance management, human resource management systems, diversity management, and change management. Stakeholders often emphasize different public values that influence what they hold desirable in public service provision. The authors critically reflect on which stakeholder interests are included and excluded in empirical studies. The institutional perspective informs critical reflection on public sector context factors that affect the management-performance relationship in democratic societies. By paying attention to distinctive features of the public sector context, the volume contributes to both knowledge growth and the improvement of public services in practice. © the several contributors 2021.","Employee attitudes; Employee outcomes; Institutional perspective; Leadership; Management; Multidisciplinary approach; Public management research; Public sector context; Public service performance; Stakeholders",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111853570

It sets directions for future research and discusses implications for public organizations’ practice. There is ample evidence that management contributes to performance, both directly and indirectly, through influencing employees’ (public service) motivation, organizational commitment, and job performance. There is also evidence that management contributes to employee outcomes, both positive, such as their job satisfaction and employability, and negative, such as stress and burnout. The chapter reflects critically on the state of public management research and outlines four key issues for future research: (1) work toward an integrated theoretical framework; (2) develop more comprehensive theoretical models; (3) pay attention to the public sector context; and (4) increase methodological rigor. The chapter contends that public management-performance research remains relevant in the era of inter-organizational networks and co-production, if and when studies pay explicit attention to the public sector context and to the frontline employees involved in service production. The chapter advises public organizations to invest in service provision policies that fit the organizational mission and create the conditions for their implementation by frontline managers who can help public employees create public value. © the several contributors 2021.","Employee outcomes; Implications for practice; Management; Public employees; Public management research; Public sector context; Public service performance; Public value governance",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111807669

While transformational leadership is typically used more in planned processes of change, distributed leadership often accompanies emergent change processes. A key insight, however, is that the two leadership approaches should be viewed as complementary, depending on the characteristics of the different public organizations’ environments and structures. The bureaucratic structure and primacy of politics, the employment of public service professionals, and the environmental complexity with many stakeholders and complexity in tasks are all factors that affect the effectiveness of change leadership in public organizations. Future studies should address these characteristics in comparative and longitudinal studies that examine the mechanisms through which leadership contributes to the implementation of organizational change. © the several contributors 2021.","Change leadership; Distributed leadership; Organizational change; Organizational complexity; Transformational leadership",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111800695

Yet, public administration scholars often neglect the stakeholders despite their vital role in defining good performance in democratic political systems. This chapter combines theoretical perspectives on public values (different understandings of the desirable) with contributions focused on creating public value. The chapter also pays attention to the co-existing and competing governance paradigms that are part of the context in which managing for public service performance occurs. These paradigms provide institutional templates, policies, operational strategies, and desired programs that prescribe how public service provision should be structured and how it should operate. Governance paradigms can be used to understand the links between stakeholders, public values, and public service performance. Giving insight into these links is the key contribution of the chapter.

However, the central problem with these different approaches is that the patient is either absent or considered a passive user of the system. Thus, there is a need for a different approach that sees the patient as an active contributor to solving wicked problems.

Additionally, well-being and positive and negative affect were assessed before games (n = 24) over 62 days. Separate two-level regression analysis using Bayesian statistics was conducted to test potential relationships. Results: Results show a credible positive relationship between the average level of well-being and within-person variability over time as well as the average level in positive affect. This indicates that resilience might be a protector for mental health. In addition, higher levels of trait anxiety (i.e., subscale concentration disruption) were associated with higher levels of negative affect and higher variability over time. This indicates that trait anxiety might facilitate negative affect. No other credible relationships were found. Conclusion: High resilience and low trait anxiety are identified as relevant factors for mental health within elite footballers during COVID-19.

Comparing a first-order and second-order structural equation model with survey data from 368 American production facilities, we find that lean production and management accounting practices (value stream costing and accounting measures of variance) collectively–rather than additively–affect performance. This finding indicates that organisations obtain greater performance by integrating lean production and management accounting practices into a system. The second purpose of this research is to determine whether the length of time organisations have employed lean production (‘time with lean’) moderates the joint effect of lean production and management accounting practices on performance. We find that the joint performance effect is positively moderated by the time with lean (i.e. we find a positive progressive learning curve). This contradicts the traditional wisdom on learning, which suggests that the benefits from learning are degressive. We argue that this positive moderation derives from the difficulty of understanding relations between multiple variables and the need for organisations to promote system-wide coherence via holistic changes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","accounting practices; lean; performance; time compression; Value stream costing","Costs; Data streams; Joint performance; Management accounting; Performance effect; Performance measure; Production companies; Production facility; Progressive learning; Structural equation modeling; Lean production",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110931702

Moreover, the strength of bias in favor of the public organization increases with the length of job tenure, and it is much more pronounced among politically left-leaning teachers. Thus, the results show that street-level bureaucrats’ performance perceptions reflect a clear sector bias, which indicates a tendency to defend their professional identity, and that the strength of this bias is conditioned by personal work experiences and political values.

A study of the use of workplace assessments (WPAs) in 1669 Danish agencies shows that conflict operates in two ways. On the one hand, conflict is associated with lower levels of factors conventionally known to enhance use, including stakeholder participation, management support, and perceived reliability of the information. On the other hand, conflict is associated with an increase in the documentary function of WPAs (meaning the formal provision of documentation of knowledge already existing in the organization). This function may be central for the use of WPAs in formal organizational decision-making and helps explain how performance information can be consequential in contemporary organizations, even when people disagree about whether it provides a reliable picture of reality. The findings suggest that both theorists and practitioners should pay more attention to how different pathways to use of performance information hinge on variations in the level of conflict. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","evaluative information; organizational conflict; pathways to use; performance information; workplace assessments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109871086

While multinational enterprises (MNEs) have been highly visible under the environmental radar, and accordingly under increasing public scrutiny regarding their sustainability impacts, the SMEs have not been much in focus. In total, the effect of the roughly 400 million SMEs are critical to shaping a sustainable planet and, therefore, should not be overlooked. The chapter discusses environmental responsibility in relation to SMEs. The chapter concludes that society cannot afford not to pose the same environmental responsibility to SMEs as is being done to large enterprises. In doing so, however, it is vital, that it be recognised that SMEs are structurally, economically and culturally different. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Aharon Factor and John Parm Ulhøi.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109638073

Going beyond these confines would have severe consequences for humankind. To prevent this from happening, government, corporate and community initiatives must focus on reducing the environmental impact of approximately 400 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), given that they produce approximately 70% of the world’s pollution, 60% of carbon emissions and have a significant impact on land. To date, research shows that SMEs have been environmental laggards and more needs to be understood to improve sustainability in the SME sector. Broadening the researcher’s methodological focus, beyond traditional singular approaches, improves knowledge generation and better informs policy and practice. This book paves the way by showing the reader that a mixed method research design is able to provide a deep, diverse and holistic understanding of sustainability and SMEs. Importantly, the book also provides an in-depth mapping of mixed method sustainability and SME research at a regional level.

The results show that stewardship offers new opportunities for politicians, enabling better diagnosis of control problems, more robust control solutions, as well as a pronounced mobilization of employee support for those solutions. However, political competition, political discontinuity after elections, scandals in the press, resistance in the administration, and more diffuse decision-making processes pose potential challenges for politicians striving to tackle the problem of escalating control through stewardship. © 2021 by the author.

This theme section considers heritagization of Asian cities against the backdrop of modernisation and (sub)urbanisation, in articles focusing on Kolkata, Beijing, Hanoi and Taipei. The articles explore local people’s multiple experiences within lived environments in terms of modernity and heritage, not so much by focusing on how different visions of modernity and nostalgia are materialised through the label of heritage, but by describing and analysing the modalities of such nostalgia among different groups of people, as expressed and mediated in different forms and practices. We propose to capture the diverse cognitive, memorial, affective, emotional and imaginative aspects of heritage on the part of the people living with that heritage in terms of vernacular heritage, which we define as cultural heritage that is conceived, perceived, experienced, imagined and practiced by different groups of ‘lay people’ with varying connections to specific heritage sites, environments and practices. ©, Oscar Salemink.","Asian cities; Heritagization; memory; space; vernacular heritage",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109391128

Findings: As newcomers to the nursing profession, nursing students are exposed to experienced insiders’ hazing ritual “quizzing” during their internship at Danish hospitals. “Quizzing” is a public ceremony performed by an experienced insider, e.g. a daily or clinical supervisor. The ritual continues until a bystander intervenes even though the newcomer admits not knowing the answers. “Quizzing” is being met with repulsion and represents a deviation from expectations of social inclusion, civilized behavior and hope of resonance. It leaves newcomers feeling alienated and makes them adopting a repulsive mode of relating to the workgroup.

The uncertainty originates from others' decisions and their consequences, and cannot be meaningfully reduced to risk. The authors postulate that, in order to cope with this type of uncertainty, bankers use simple rules, also called heuristics. This study aims to identify such heuristics and the psychological processes that underlie them. Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 22 managers of teams tasked to anticipate prices, in two leading investment and central banks. The primary data came from in-depth, semi-structured interviews lasting 30–60 min, supplemented by our observations during the on-site visits, emails and phone calls when preparing the interviews, and reports published by the banks. Data were coded and heuristics were induced over multiple rounds by multiple researchers. Findings: Bankers (1) construct simple game representations of markets, (2) make inferences to gauge opponents, (3) become alert when they see too much agreement and (4) communicate coherent narratives. Heuristics (1)–(3) are employed when the pace of decision-making is fast, whereas (4) is used for longer time scales. In sum, bankers exhibit reciprocal bounded rationality, wherein interaction partners are mutually aware of and adapted to the fundamental uncertainty of the task and their limited resources.

The intervention aimed to include and involve the young workers in the management of their work environment and work conditions, and simultaneously to strengthen the organization’s ability to include them in the H&S management. The study was designed as a multiple case study. Twelve youth H&S groups were established and ran for 2 months within 10 supermarkets. Results based on qualitative data suggest that H&S groups for young workers have potential for increasing inclusion and involvement in the work environment among the young workers and for being beneficial for the supermarkets.

Design/methodology/approach: Meta-reflection on method issues in Action Research through an action research case study with an innovation group during an organizational change process. This case demonstrates an example of an action research cycle focused on building practitioner legitimacy rather than problem-solving. Findings: Key findings include (1) demonstrating how AR can be used for building legitimacy through visualizing the innovation process, and embedding those visuals in top management practices of the organization; and (2) demonstrating how AR can work as an organizational learning tool in merger contexts. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses on an action research cooperation during a two-and-a-half-year period. Thus, findings offer the depth of a medium term case study. The processes of building legitimacy represent this particular case, and can be investigated in other organizational contexts to see the extent to which these issues can be generalized. Practical implications: For researchers, this paper offers an additional type of AR cycle to consider in their research design which can be seen as demonstrating a form of interplay between practitioner action and organizational level legitimacy. For practitioners, this paper demonstrates a connection between legitimacy and organizational learning in innovation contexts. The discussion of how visuals were co-created and used for building legitimacy for an innovation process that differs from the standard stage gate model demonstrates how engaging in AR research can contribute to developing visuals as resources for building legitimacy and organizational learning based on connections between theory and practice. Originality/value: This case rethinks AR practice for innovation project management contexts to include legitimacy and organizational learning. This focus on legitimacy building from organizational learning and knowledge conversion contributes to our understanding of the soft side of innovation project management.

We introduce the concept of platform identity to delineate the platform’s technological and market profile delineating the platform’s competitive identity domain and distinguish it from platform size (which reflects the scale of its user and complementor network). We argue that each platform has a unique identity, and comparisons of rival platforms along these two strategic dimensions—platform size and platform identity—help to explain the nature of competition in digital markets and explain the unique competitive dynamics that depart from mainstream competitive theory’s predictions. Our framework also helps to identify cases where the market boundaries and competitive domains become contested because of platform competition, leading to market convergence.

In this paper, we challenge this view, and instead explore the possibility for middle managers to engage with and make systems enabling rather than constraining, thereby supporting locally relevant change initiatives. We specifically explore how managers engage with employee surveys, as organization wide standardized systems, and work to make these enabling. Based on interviews with 48 managers and observations of 10 meetings in 5 different organizations, we identify three main strategies: reinterpretation, prioritization, and embedding. Drawing on complexity leadership theory, we argue that through these strategies, the managers succeed in creating a temporary adaptive space, thereby facilitating development and innovation. Our findings contribute to the literature on middle managers by developing a detailed understanding of the possibility for enabling leadership in this position. MAD statement Standardized measurement and control systems are often expected to drive change and development, but risk constraining rather than enabling middle managerial leadership. Our study of how managers engage with an organization wide standardized employee survey reveals that through their work, the system can be ‘tamed’ and made to facilitate rather than hinder development. The study suggests that to make the survey useful for change and development, aligned with organizational goals but at the same time adapted to local needs, the managers’ extensive effort is a critical factor. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","complexity leadership; employee survey; leadership; Middle managers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108199857

Design/methodology/approach: Initiating with an introduction of the historical and political contexts of Sámi and Greenlandic Inuit indigeneity, the study compares lyrics, stage performances and artefacts of two Sámi and Greenlandic contributions into the European Song Contest. This is used to discuss the situated ways in which indigenous identity and culture are branded. Findings: The study shows how seemingly “similar” indigenous identity positions take on very different expressions and meanings as Arctic, indigenous and global identity discourses manifest themselves and intertwine in a Greenlandic and Sámi context. This indicates, as we discuss, that indigeneity in a Nordic context is tightly connected to historical and political specificities. Research limitations/implications: The study argues against a “one size fits all” approach to defining the indigenous and even more so attempts to “pinning down” universal indigenous issues or challenges.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is explorative. Measures of stereotypes and self-stereotypes are constructed and analyzed with regressions models that control for a large number of individual and firm characteristics. Findings: The results document significant gender differences in stereotyping among managers. Male managers have significantly more masculine stereotypes of successful leaders, and they rate themselves higher on masculine traits than female managers. For CEOs, the picture is different. Stereotypes do not differ by gender and female CEOs have more pronounced masculine stereotypes than female managers at lower levels. Female managers at the age of 50 are the least gender stereotyping managers. Younger female managers have significantly more masculine stereotypes about the role as a successful leader. Research limitations/implications: This study is based on cross-sectional data and does not claim to uncover causal relationships. Practical implications: The results suggest that gender stereotypes and self-stereotypes among Danish private-sector managers are not going to change quickly indicating that new government policies with more focus on gender equalization and affirmative actions are called for.

These are traditionally attributed to inaccurate foresight and poor planning. Outlining a nonanticipatory alternate, the authors seek to explain the ability to rebound from unexpected events, without foresight, using resilient systems theory. This paper seeks to outline the theoretical underpinnings of project resilience and to identify criteria for planning and selecting projects for greater resilience. Design/methodology/approach: Investigating project resilience, this paper studies the relationship between unexpected events and project performance in 21 projects. The authors perform a systematic review of project ex post evaluations 3–12 years after project completion. Findings: First, the authors find that all projects encountered unexpected events, even when discounting planning error. Second, the authors show that, as a consequence, projects underperformed, not necessarily relative to formal criteria, but in terms of subjective opportunity cost, that is, relative to competing alternates – known or imagined – foregone by their implementation. Finally, the authors identify four types of resilient projects – superior, equivalent, compensatory and convertible projects – as opportunities for building project resilience. Practical implications: The properties of resilient projects provide opportunities for building resilience in complex projects.

Design/methodology/approach: The typology is developed based on a traditional review of the performance management literature from three types of functional areas, represented by operations and production management, management accounting and human resource management. Findings: The cross-functional typology illustrates how the different types of purposes discussed in the literature can be organised in a hierarchical structure. In this way, the basic purpose of organisational value creation for PMSPs can be decomposed into two layers of sub-purposes, the first specifying the domain and the second outlining the specific managerial use of PMSPs. Practical implications: The presented typology may help managers across different functional areas map the purposes of their PMSPs; this mapping will not only provide the basics for understanding a PMSP's potential value for an organisation but also serve as an important input for PMSP design. Originality/value: The presented typology has a broader scope than existing typologies of purposes in research and, consequently, better interrelates and tracks the various types of purposes discussed across different functional areas. This contributes not only to our understanding of performance management as a cross-functional field but also to research on the use and design of PMSPs in organisations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Conceptual framework; Cross-functionality; Performance management; Performance measurement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106422970

Closer connections and collaboration (such as strategic partnerships) among architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) companies and across the values chain is often prescribed as a strategy to improve the performance of the construction industry. However, the institutional roles of AEC companies and their archetypical business models serve as important reference points for the sector. How these business models interact, and the friction created when they come in close contact is not well researched and understood. This paper identifies business models archetypes for architect, engineer, contractor and materials supplier based on workshops and interviews with practitioners. Friction is identified in and between the business models of AEC companies engaging in strategic partnerships. The analysis shows that architect archetypes face friction with regard to their profit formula and could benefit from profit sharing. The engineering archetypes face friction in their processes since they have to coordinate with specialists from other companies. Contractor and supplier archetypes face friction in their profit formula since the open books force them to alter business practices. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AEC; archetypes; architecture; Business model; engineering and construction sector; friction; value chain","Architecture; Construction industry; Contractors; Mergers and acquisitions; Profitability; Wages; Architecture , engineering and constructions; Business modeling; Business models; Business practices; Institutional role; Profit sharing; Reference points; Strategic partnership; Friction; architecture; business; construction industry; friction; partnership approach; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106322915

Research has shown that managers' aspirations are important to ensure firms' growth, but researchers know less of where their aspirations come from and how variation in these aspirations shapes organizational outcomes. By focusing on two growth strategies of particular importance for small firms – innovation and internationalization – the authors map out how managers' ambitious aspirations may create negative organizational effects and also how they may counteract such effects. Design/methodology/approach: The study employs structural equation modeling (SEM) on a sample of 249 Norwegian small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Findings: The findings of this study suggest that managerial experience is associated with high aspirations as well as high change effectiveness on the managerial team. The authors find that ambitious growth aspirations are associated with exploration in the form of radical innovation but also lead to reduced employee well-being. Managers' level of perceived change effectiveness, on the other hand, is positively associated with radical innovation and also raises employee well-being. Research limitations/implications: This study highlights the positive and negative effects of managerial aspirations on different organizational outcomes. Further, it shows that managerial teams working effectively together in the face of change is important for the well-being of employees. Results confirm the positive relationship between aspirations for growth and applied growth strategies in organizations. The data sample is, however, extracted from one country only, and the authors cannot exclude the possibility that findings will be different elsewhere. Practical implications: To ensure successful growth, managers should combine ambitious aspirations with attention to the top management team's (TMT) experience levels and change effectiveness. Assessment of possible needs for development and adjustments could ensure growth processes with limited negative effects for employee well-being. Originality/value: By distinguishing between growth through international sales (exploitation) and growth through a more change-intensive strategy of radical innovation (exploration), the authors investigate how variations in managerial aspirations and perceptions influence organizational growth processes. This paper paints a unique picture of how managers can be both the cause and cure of employee well-being in change-demanding situations. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Change effectiveness; Employee well-being; Growth aspirations; Internationalization; Managerial characteristics; Radical innovation; SEM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106319794

However, establishing joint OSH engagement between managers and workers is still a challenge. Little is known about how managers and workers’ “complaining” about OSH affects collective OSH action and the quality of manager-worker relations. Drawing on an understanding of complaining as “boundary work”, this study empirically analyses how managers and workers’ verbalisations either downplay (collaboration) or build (demarcation) boundaries. Interviews and observations between managers and workers were carried out on a construction project in Denmark to identify why and how complaining is used. A typology consisting of four “complaining” mechanisms was developed, highlighting their associated relational dynamics: (1) Shifting responsibility for advancing OSH, (2) Defending oneself against strained working conditions, (3) Dealing strategically with criticism, and (4) Blaming other occupational groups. Complaining about OSH as boundary work–both collaboration and demarcation–between managers and workers furthers professional fragmentation and conflicts OSH collaboration, yet it occurs in a “safe space” for professional disagreement. We suggest that these communicational aspects and associated relational dynamics should be an area of increased focus in order to promote managers and workers’ OSH collaboration. © 2021 The Author(s).

The potential of different virtual factory (VF) tools and approaches to support simultaneous engineering for the design, and development of these domains has been addressed in the literature. To fulfil this potential, there is a need for an approach which integrates the product, process and production systems for designing and developing VF and its validation in real-life cases. This paper aims to present an integrated design approach for VF design and development, as well as a demonstration implemented in a wind turbine manufacturing plant. Design/methodology/approach: As the research calls for instrumental knowledge to discover the effects of intervention on the operations of an enterprise, design science research methodology is considered to be a well-suited methodology for exploring practical usefulness of a generic design to close the theory–practice gap. The study was planned as an exploratory research activity which encompassed the simultaneous design and development of artefacts and retrospective analysis of the design and implementation processes. The extended VF concept, architecture, a demonstration and procedures followed during the research work are presented and evaluated. Findings: The artefacts (models and methods) and the VF demonstrator, which was evaluated by industry experts and scholars based on the role of the VF in improving the performance in the evaluation and reconfiguration of new or existing factories, reduce the ramp-up and design times, supporting management decisions. Preliminary results are presented and discussed. Research limitations/implications: The concept VF model, its architecture and general methodology as an integrated design and development approach, can be adopted and used for VF design and development both for discrete and continuous manufacturing plants. The development and demonstration were limited, however, because real-time synchronisation, 3D laser scanning data and a commonly shared data model, to enable the integration of different VF tools, were not achievable. Originality/value: The paper presents a novel VF concept and architecture, which integrates product, process and production systems. Moreover, design and development methods of the concept and its demonstration for a wind turbine manufacturing plant are presented. The paper, therefore, contributes to the information systems and manufacturing engineering field by identifying a novel concept and approach to the effective design and development of a VF and its function in the analysis, design and development of manufacturing systems. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discrete event simulation; Factory design; Factory planning; Manufacturing system; Smart factory; Virtual factory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106304402

However, partners often have different timelines and planning horizons, understanding of purpose and concepts of value. This hybridity poses organizational challenges pertaining to trust, goal setting, learning and coordination, which may lead to “mission drift,” i.e. compromising or displacement of intended goals. Despite the risk mission drift poses, its underlying dynamics are not sufficiently understood, and the means to mitigate it are unclear. This study aims to address these questions. Design/methodology/approach: Through eight broad and one deep case study of innovation partnerships funded by Innovation Fund Denmark (IFD), the authors investigate how partnerships reconcile multiple expectations and interests within the IFD framework and how this might lead to mission drift. The authors draw upon existing theories on the organizational challenges of innovation partnerships and supplement these with new empirically based propositions on the risk of mission drift. Findings: This study identifies a core tension between partnership complexity and the degree of formalization. Depending on how these dimensions are combined in relation to particular goals, the partnership mission is likely to become narrower or more unpredictable than intended. Thus, the authors theorize the significance of partnership composition and requisite formalization for a given innovation purpose. Originality/value: This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of mission drift in innovation partnerships by opening the organizational black box of partnerships. The findings underscore the value of explorative case studies for specifying the contingencies of organizational design and governance mechanisms for different innovation goals. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Management; Organizational effectiveness; Organizational theory; Partnership; Project evaluation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106302472

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on cross-disciplinary literature, the authors develop a multilevel conceptual framework. The theoretically informed framework advances research on servitization and GVCs and provides a line of inquiry to be explored as avenues for future research opportunities. Findings: The authors argue that servitization instigates the formation of new ecosystems and collaborative structures within GVCs, reduces the fragmentation of the overall network structure and increases embeddedness within the subclusters of GVCs. These changes are expected to be reflected in the increase in the complexity of firms' GVC governance tasks, a greater reliance on relational governance, and an increase in the dependency on local partners in terms of the governance of GVCs. Originality/value: This conceptual paper establishes the link between servitization and GVCs, anchors the servitization phenomenon in GVCs, explains how servitizing firms can engage in and shape GVCs and offers insights into the servitization-driven changes in GVCs. The conceptual framework is intended to lay the foundation for future empirical research on the link between servitization and GVCs. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Global value chains (GVCs); Governance; Servitization; Structure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106066075

Practitioners and researchers face difficulties in synthesising relevant perspectives from across fields, as behavioural challenges are complex and multi-dimensional. This study takes a three step theory-building approach. First, we review behavioural theories and models primarily rooted in psychology, and discuss them in relation to design perspectives to identify parameters key to behavioural design. Next, we synthesise previously fragmented behavioural and design parameters and propose the Behavioural Design Space (BDS) framework, including: Cognition, Ability, Motivation, Timing, Social, and Physical Context. Last, as a demonstration of its use, we apply the BDS framework as lens on observed expert behavioural designer’s ideation. Our findings are twofold. First, the synthesis of generic behavioural and design parameters allow us to investigate expert behavioural designer’s ideation across five diverse cases. This illustrates the BDS’ potential of providing relevant overview across diverse domains. Second, the expert behavioural designers observed often utilised the less abstract parameter, Physical Context, and favoured low variation of parameters within concepts. This point to a need for support to help designers discover potential pitfalls and blind spots, as well as further study of behavioural design ideation. © 2021 Bay Brix Nielsen, Daalhuizen, & Cash.","Behavioural Design; Case Study; Design Space; Expert Designers; Framework; Ideation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106015600

A truck fire on a suspension bridge may lead to main cable failure or a strength reduction that will either cause down-graded classification of the load carrying capacity or need for long lasting repairs of the main cable with large costs and traffic disruption as severe consequences. A serious fire in a truck occurred in 2013 on the New Little Belt Suspension Bridge in Denmark, and caused rapidly rising flame temperatures to above 1000 °C, somewhat similar to a hydrocarbon fire. Based on this accident and a number of other incidents with fires on roads and bridges, a risk and cost–benefit study focusing on fire risks for this bridge was carried out. Based on the result of the study, it was decided to provide fire protection to the main cables on the New Little Belt Bridge. Due to the large socio economic importance, the need for similar mitigation of fire hazards has been considered for bridges such as Älvsborg Suspension Bridge (Sweden), Great Belt East Bridge (Denmark) and A.L. MacDonald Suspension Bridge (Canada). Current status is that fire retro protection projects have been decided and are being prepared for the latter two bridges. Based on the accident on New Little Belt Bridge, a fire protection concept for main cables has been developed after detailed studies of the fire impact on this occasion. This has resulted in advanced modelling of the fire loading on a main cable and in design elaboration of an efficient fire hazard mitigation concept for main cables. This paper describes the systematic process for evaluation of the fire accident on New Little Belt Bridge and how this has evolved into a very efficient fire hazard mitigation concept for main cables. The concept may be used on existing as well as on new suspension bridges being essential elements in national road infrastructure systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105214117

When the value of patient-developed solutions is considered, the evidence is that these solutions consistently help improve the overall quality of life. Patient-developed innovations are very heterogeneous in nature, level of quality, sophistication, and cost; nonetheless, the majority are frugal in cost and design. In this paper, we explore the organizational lessons of the patient innovation platform and community, and its leadership expressions, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Multi-sided online platforms for collecting, curating, and distributing those innovations can help in the fight against the pandemic by centralizing decentralization and we consider this theme in terms of our understanding of when leadership is distributed and when it is not. Distributed leadership can be considered as a paradox, a process in which leadership is retained and dispersed.

Attention needs to be given to bottom-up frugal innovations developed by citizens who are not scientists, who do so in a distributed way through formal mechanisms (such as multi-sided platform) for collecting, curating and distributing those innovations and can help in the fight against the pandemic. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19 innovation; Distributed leadership; distributed leadership as paradox; user innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105191481

While the concept of sustainability increasingly is applied in tourism research, the implications of CE in tourism have not received much attention. This paper argues that CE offers great potentials as an integrative and instructive framework for encouraging more sustainable tourism practices. It introduces, theoretically, CE in a broader socio-technical transition perspective, explores tourism as the specific context for application and provides an empirical example of a Danish hotel, inspired by a pragmatic circular business model. The paper also argues that tourism, due to its close host–guest relationships, potentially holds transformative potentials beyond how CE has been used in other fields.

Impression management activities, however, challenge the ethnographic researcher. Impression management happens when observees act in a different way than they would routinely, due to the presence of an audience. In the paper, we draw on data collected as a part of a wider ethnographic study to illustrate how the relationship between observer and observees can be understood through the lens of impression management. In particular, we show how the researcher assumes a dual role as both an audience and a storyteller in ethnographic studies. The researcher can thus be seen as an audience for the observees in their attempts to present themselves as agreeable and perform accordingly in front of the researcher as well as each other. This happens in part, as the observees attribute the researcher the role as storyteller, knowing that accounts of their practice and performance may be communicated to the research community and the industry in general. While impression management complicates the relationship between the observees and the observer, and can be seen as a potential source of bias, we also suggest that it presents an opportunity for increased empirical robustness of ethnographic findings if acknowledged. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ethnography; impression management; methodology; methods; qualitative data","Construction; Construction management research; Dual role; Ethnographic methods; Ethnographic study; Impression management; Potential sources; Research communities; Through the lens; Project management; empirical analysis; ethnography; performance assessment; project management; qualitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105135025

The organizational levels of CPA manager, supervisor and other staff are significant in explaining the presence of the technicalexpertise logic, but not the fiduciary logic. Higher moral reasoning of auditors and being a female are significantly associated with the presence of the fiduciary logic. All four organizational levels are significant in explaining the identified commercial logic with further tests indicating that partners place more emphasis than supervisors on the commercial logic. Additional tests examine whether moral reasoning is associated with the professional fiduciary, professional technical-expertise and commercial logics and whether organizational levels explain moral reasoning. We find that a higher professional fiduciary logic is associated with higher auditor moral reasoning.

The study provides an inventory of mobile touristic services. Narratives acquired from qualitative interviews performed throughout a collaborative action research project illuminate that mobilities of tourism services are matters of both pragmatic economic calculation, business relational issues, and negotiated space resource acquisition. The entrepreneurial stage, ambition, and resource constellation explain how, why, and when tourism businesses prefer to work in sticky or slippery environments. There is an increasing need for tourism actors and planning authorities to address the features of hypermobilities and to ensure to harvest benefits of the moving without compromising the coherent livability of communities and tourism locations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","entrepreneurship; Mobilities paradigm; service en route; territoriality; tourism enactment",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104693369

In these situations, enterprise risk management (ERM) can serve as a dynamic capability (DC) to overcome the impending crisis and improve SMEs' survival rates. To explore this capacity, which has only been vaguely addressed in prior research, we conduct an exploratory, abductive study to update the extant (ERM and DC) literature with empirical evidence from expert interviews. Design/methodology/approach: We conduct an exploratory, abductive study using empirical evidence from expert interviews. Findings: Our findings reveal ERM as a second-order DC in the micro-foundational components of competitive intelligence gathering, alliance building and integrative capabilities. We find that competitive intensity and government policy moderate the effects of these foundational capabilities. Finally, our study proposes a survivability model that provides new valuable knowledge of ERM as a DC for SMEs to deal with competition-driven crises. Originality/value: This research survivability model shows how ERM as DC can facilitate the survivability of SMEs against competitive surprises. Although restricted to crises arising out of competitive surprises, this study provides valuable knowledge to the literature on what type of DCs are useful for specific situations. The study findings not only extended Teece's (2007) DCs framework to competitive crises but also placed it within a hierarchy of capabilities. The research findings indicate that an ERM culture in SMEs promote the growth and development of sensing, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities, vital for tiding competitive crises. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crisis; Dynamic capabilities; Strategic management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104265689

To address this issue, we examine nonresponse bias among public managers by analyzing multilevel surveys of managers and employees in which we can compare employee ratings of leadership for both responding and nonresponding managers. Using 16,531 employee responses spread over six data sets from three countries, we find only limited evidence of nonresponse bias in managers’ self-reported leadership.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a qualitative design to investigate the challenges of co-designing an intervention in five workshops involving health professionals, patients and relatives. “Challenges” are understood as “situations of being faced with something that needs great mental or physical effort in order to be done successfully and therefore tests a person's ability” (Cambridge Dictionary). Thematic content analysis was conducted with a background in the analytical question: “What key challenges arise in the material in relation to the co-design process?”. Findings: Two key challenges were identified: engagement and facilitation. These consisted of five sub-themes: recruiting patients and relatives, involving physicians, adjusting to a new researcher role, utilizing contextual knowledge and handling ethical dilemmas. Research limitations/implications: The population of patients and relatives participating in the workshops was small, which likely affected the co-design process. Practical implications: Researchers who want to use co-design must be prepared for the extra time required and the need for skills concerning engagement, communication, facilitation, negotiation and resolution of conflict. Time is also required for ethical discussions and considerations concerning different types of knowledge creation. Originality/value: Engaging stakeholders in co-design processes is increasingly encouraged.

Design/methodology/approach: Referring to four templates for the design of conceptual papers as outlined by Jaakkola (2020), i.e. theory synthesis, theory adaptation, typology and model – we adopt an approach combining theory/literature synthesis and model establishment. Based on a thorough analysis and discussion of the literature on the topics of “context effect “, “interface between theory and context”, “special characteristics of Chinese context” and “invalid application of Agency Theory in a Chinese context”, we use Agency Theory as the lens to discuss the importance of context in applying and developing paradigmatic theory specifically. We start from the contextualization of Agency Theory and then explore approaches to theorizing the Chinese context by developing a conflict coefficient model. Findings: First, the application validity of paradigmatic theories is not sustainable; contextual factors are critical in applying and developing not only propositional but also paradigmatic theories, such as Agency Theory. Second, the Chinese context requires special attention when applying paradigmatic theories originating from Western countries. Third, the traditional application logic of Agency Theory is invalid in the Chinese context due to the coexistence of principal-agent conflicts (PAC) and principal–principal conflicts (PPC), and changeable dominance status of two conflicts according to the contexts. Based on these observations, a model of contextualization theory of PAC and PPC (i.e. conflict coefficient model) is developed from a dynamic perspective, which connects the separated situation states and allows the identification and measurement of the relative severity of the two types of agency conflicts. Practical implications: Practitioners can also use this model to identify and measure the relative strength of the two conflicts and determine the direction of control and improvement. Moreover, analysis of Chinese context and agency problems of Chinese firms also has great practical significance considering the increased importance of the Chinese market and the increasingly important role played by Chinese firms in the international economy in general, and in specific host countries in particular. Originality/value: First, in general, this study expands Whetten's (2009) study of the interface between theory and context. It specifically discusses approaches to considering contextual factors in the development and application of the relatively overlooked paradigmatic theories, using traditional and widely used Agency Theory as a lens. Our study suggests that typical Agency Theory, developed based on Western-centric assumptions, does not completely hold in the context of Chinese business practices because of different cultural, legal and governance realities. Second, it improves and extends the application of Agency Theory by proposing the new perspective that PAC and PPC coexist in specific contexts and positing that the relative severity of two types of agency conflicts depends on the context variables. Third, it puts forward a conflict coefficient model offering a more comprehensive, intuitive and quantifiable method for comparing the extent of the two conflicts in different scenarios, providing a reference for empirical studies of corporate governance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agency theory; Chinese context; Contextualizing theory; Theorizing about context; Theory development",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103916120

Findings: The findings in this study revealed IoT engagement antecedents as IoT readiness, commitment, communication, involvement and support and, consequently, the outcomes of IoT engagement as trust, loyalty, better performance and satisfaction. Furthermore, IoT engagement needs to be considered from three perspectives, namely, from a multidimensional perspective, beyond a dyad perspective and from the service-dominant logic perspective, which suggests thinking of goods as services and highlights the importance of value co-creation.

Stark’s notions of heterarchy, lateral accountability, and creative friction are applied to analyze the development of an original interpretation in an Italian opera house. The analysis demonstrated how innovation emerges from the interplay of multiple performance criteria. These criteria are based not only on the different technical and discipline-specific requirements involved in the production of live performances (industrial principles) but also on a number of individual sensitivities (the inspiration principle).

Previous research shows that multimedia-guide usage increases customer interaction and satisfaction. However, current literature lacks empirical evidence on whether in nostalgia evoking visitor attractions, multimedia-guide usage increases satisfaction and positive word-of-mouth or not. Moderating effect of multimedia-guide usage on the nostalgia and willingness to share positive word-of-mouth association was analysed using a field-experiment in a German Wax museum (N = 241). A moderated moderation included perceived visitor attraction content age as a three-way-interaction. Results show that the positive impact of perceived nostalgia on willingness to share positive word-of-mouth is weaker for multimedia-guide users. The older visitors perceive visitor attraction’s content, the weaker is the negative moderating effect of multimedia-guide usage on the nostalgia to positive word-of-mouth association.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted three rounds of interviews, ethnographic observations of meetings and document analyses in five German hospitals between February and August 2020. Findings: The authors found that actors repeatedly used a central set of indicators (the number of beds for COVID-19 patients) when adapting a healthcare infrastructure to the pandemic. Accounting figures allowed actors to problematize prior configurations, organize processes to make uncertainty plannable and virtualize changes to resume treating non-COVID-19 patients. Practical implications: The authors offer suggestions about scenario planning and interorganizational learning which have implications for healthcare practitioners. Originality/value: The authors contribute to the accounting in crisis literature by adding an organization-focused study. Adding nuance to key themes in the literature, they show how the organizations and the field level interact and how organizing locally preceded economizing.

To address this gap, we draw from the policy design and administrative burden literatures to develop the concept of burden tolerance - the willingness of policymakers and people more generally to passively allow or actively impose state actions that result in others experiencing administrative burdens. Drawing on a survey experiment and observational data with Danish local politicians in a social welfare setting, we find that more right-wing politicians are more tolerant of burdens, but politicians are less willing to impose burdens on a welfare claimant perceived as being more deserving. Politicians with a personal experience of receiving welfare benefits themselves are less tolerant of burdens, while information about the psychological costs experienced by claimants did not reduce burden tolerance. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Effort is a multidimensional concept and teams have many ways to alter effort supplied in a match. For example, the players included or left out of the starting 11, the tactics used in a specific match, substitutions made during a match, and other factors under team control, can be interpreted as changes in effort supplied. Research Methods: OLS models explaining observed variation in betting odds are estimated for roughly 25,000 regular season football games in 8 top European domestic leagues from 2000–2001 through 2018–2019. Results: Regression results indicate bookmakers alter betting odds on matches involving clubs in the middle of the domestic league standings that have no chance of qualifying for the Champions/Europa Leagues or being relegated. In other words, bookmakers and bettors believe these teams will not put forth maximum effort to compete in and win these matches. We find similar results for teams already assured of relegation and teams that already clinched the league championship. Implications: Overall, the research contributes to literature analyzing the impact of incentives in sporting contests. As the world of professional sport and sports gambling become increasingly interconnected and integrated, the results of the study present opportunities not only for collaboration between the parties but also an increased understanding on the role league design has on individual match outcomes. © 2021 European Association for Sport Management.","football; incentives; sports betting; Tournament theory",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103013892

The productivity analysis is conducted in two stages. First, we derive total factor productivity (TFP), and second, we estimate the effects of intangible assets on total factor productivity. Our approach for measuring intangible assets is based on occupational classifications in a linked employer–employee dataset. We construct measures for three types of intangibles: broad R&D assets (R&D), organizational assets (OC) and information and communication technology assets (ICT). In both countries, the TFP effects of broad R&D increase slightly in the period after the crisis. For Finland, we also find that the TFP effects of OC increase after the crisis, while Denmark experienced a considerable increase in OC assets after financial crises in intangible intensive industries such as information, education and health industries, where productivity is lower. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","financial crisis; firm-level data; Intangible assets; measurement; productivity",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102557473

The empirical data were gathered through a workshop with focus groups of 15 servitization manufacturers (with 22 respondents), an on-site workshop (in-depth case study), semi-structured interviews, observations and document study of archival data. Findings: The DS trajectories are idiosyncratic and dependent on design architectures of PSSw modules, balancing choices between standardization and innovation. The adoption of software systems depends on the maturity of the industry-specific digital ecosystem. Decomposition and integration of PSSw modules facilitate DS transition through business model modularity. Seven testable propositions are presented. Research limitations/implications: With the small sample size from different industries and one in-depth case study, generalizing the findings was not possible. Practical implications: The mapping exercise is powerful when top management from different functional departments can participate together to share their expertise and achieve consensus. It logs the “states” that the manufacturer undergoes over time. Originality/value: The Digital Servitization Cube serves as a conceptual framework for manufacturers to systematically map and categorize their current and future PSSw strategies. It bridges the cross-disciplinary theoretical discussion in DS. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business-model modularity; Digital servitization; Product-service-software trajectories",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102488147

The aim is to improve productivity in an injection moulding process consisting of more than 100 injection moulding machines. It has been identified that predicting quality through Machine Process Data is the key to increase productivity by reducing scrap. The scope of this work is to investigate whether a sufficient prediction accuracy (less than 10% of the specification spread) can be achieved by using readily available Machine Process Data or additional sensor signals obtained at a higher cost are needed. The latter comprises Machine Profile and Cavity Profile Data. One of the conclusions is that the available Machine Process Data does not capture the variation in the raw material that impacts element quality and therefore fails to meet the required prediction accuracy. Utilising Machine Profiles or Cavity Profiles have shown similar results in reducing the prediction error. Since the cost of implementing cavity sensors in the entire production is higher than utilising the Machine Profiles, further exploration around improving the utilisation of Machine Profile Data in a setting where process variation and labelled data are limited is proposed. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","data evaluation; deep learning; Industry 4.0; injection moulding; machine learning; predictive quality","Forecasting; Productivity; Cavity profiles; Element quality; Industrial partners; Prediction accuracy; Prediction errors; Process Improvement; Process Variation; Reducing scraps; Injection molding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102315319

We applied ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions based on a dataset containing 1597 ICOs that covers almost 2.5 years. The results show that exogenous and endogenous signals have a significant effect on the funds raised in ICOs. We also find that the Bitcoin price heavily drives the performance of ICOs.

Design/methodology/approach: The article draws upon a three-and-a-half-year at-home ethnography. The first author – as insider, participant and researcher – investigated the consequences of an organizational redesign that pushed members of a local university department into a situation of permanent liminality. Findings: The paper describes how academics simultaneously followed multiple trajectories in their identity negotiation as a response to ongoing experiences of ambiguity, disorientation, powerlessness and loss of status. Practical implications: Management decisions in higher education institutions based on administrative concerns can have adverse effects for academics, particularly when such decisions disturb, complicate or even render impossible identification processes. University managers need to realize and to respond to the struggle of academics getting lost in an endless quest for defining who they are. Originality/value: The paper highlights the dual character of identity negotiation in conditions of permanent liminality as unresolved identity work through simultaneous identification and dis-identification. It further shows the multidimensionality of this identity work and argues that identity negotiation as a response to perpetual liminality is informed by notions of struggle and notions of opportunity. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academia; Disidentification; Identification; Identity work; Permanent liminality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102200069

It considers why the ATAD CFC rules may restrict those freedoms and whether that conflict may be resolved by recourse to the general principle of abuse of law, which may prevent a taxpayer from relying on a fundamental freedom and thus prevent the restriction from arising, or to the rule of reason, which may serve to justify the restriction. The paper considers whether these may be treated as separate doctrines and some implications of doing so. The paper reaffirms that the ATAD CFC rules may be considered to be incompatible with the fundamental freedoms as interpreted in Cadbury Schweppes. Then, by reference to recent CJEU decisions, the paper interprets new standards of artificiality and reassesses the aforementioned incompatibility. Firstly, the now expanded anti-abuse principle may, in many instances, prevent the restriction from arising. Secondly, the now more generous rule of reason holds the restriction largely justified in relation to third states, and this should be extended also to intra-EU situations. Ultimately, the ATAD CFC regime is likely to be considered mostly compatible with the fundamental freedoms. © 2021.

To allow the switch between modalities, a preparedness framework for humanitarian organizations (HOs) is provided. Design/methodology/approach: A mathematical model is proposed to help humanitarian responders make quantitative decisions on the type of programs to implement in emergency responses. The model was applied to a field response by an international HO during the COVID-19 emergency in Colombia. Findings: Cash-based and in-kind distributions are not mutually exclusive response modalities during emergencies, and the real needs of beneficiaries and market effects should be included in the modality selection decision to improve program effectiveness. Research limitations/implications: The research is focused on short-term immediate response to emergencies; the proposed model assumes favorable market conditions and limits the aid options to direct in-kind and multipurpose cash assistance, excluding other types of cash transfers. Practical implications: The research outlines practical preconditions to operationalize switching between programs during an emergency. The study provides evidence that HOs should consider dynamics decision tools to select aid modalities and evaluate their response depending on market conditions. Social implications: Considering aid modality as a dynamic decision and including the needs from beneficiaries in the choice can have profound impact in the dignifying of humanitarian response to emergencies. Originality/value: The quantitative model to decide between aid modalities is a novel approach to include beneficiaries' needs and market dynamics into humanitarian supply chain research. The preparedness framework closes the gap between the emergency preparedness literature and the operational constraints that organizations face for fast program implementation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emergency logistics; Humanitarian supply chain; Not-for-profit supply chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101695882

There is a high demand for practical experiences from developing blockchain and DLT based systems in various domains outside FinTech. This work seeks to contribute to this gap by presenting real-world experiences from developing a proof of concept for automatizing conditional payments in social benefits and healthcare domains. We found that the key conditions for making these blockchain-based solutions viable are (1) attaining technological maturity and competences, (2) ecosystem thinking and adequate governance of these ecosystems, and finally (3) achieving legal and regulatory predictability.

Design/methodology/approach: Using field data from a selection of branding actors and sectors in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, a qualitative analysis of Nordic branding performances is used to unpack the negotiations of valuation of worth. Findings: The analysis identified three principle orders of worth behind Nordicness (civic, green and inspired) that are negotiated through compromises between orders of industry and domestic and by contesting the orders of fame and market. The findings indicate how Nordicness is performed as principle worths and tensions and how these are rendered meaningful as propositions of “value as difference” as they are performed in practice by brand actors. Originality/value: Several studies focus on how place branding “adds value;” however, few studies have been aimed at unpacking how a “value universe” is negotiated as a more complex understanding of worth or “value.” This study thus opens up for branding heterogeneity, which signifies awareness of competing notions and orders of worth among small- and medium-sized enterprises and other central stakeholders; this could further inspire interdisciplinary, value-based research into the potential contingencies of (product) branding and place branding in other contexts and regions. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Moral affordances; Nordic branding; Nordic place branding; Nordicness; Pragmatic sociology; Value regimes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101302942

Design/methodology/approach: To extract the latent factors (level, slope and curvature) of the Turkish sovereign yield curve, we estimate conventional Nelson and Siegel (1987) model with nonlinear least squares. Then, we decompose oil price shocks into supply, demand and risk shocks using structural VAR (structural VAR) models. After this separation, we apply Engle (2002) dynamic conditional correlation GARCH (DCC-GARCH (1,1)) method to investigate time-varying co-movements between yield curve factors and oil price shocks. Finally, using the LP (local projections) proposed by Jorda (2005), we estimate the impulse-response functions to examine the impact of different oil price shocks on yield curve factors. Findings: Our results demonstrate that the various oil price shocks influence the yield curve factors quite differently. A supply shock leads to a statistically significant increase in the level factor. This result shows that elevated oil prices due to supply disruptions are interpreted as a signal of a surge in inflation expectations since the cost channel prevails. Besides, unanticipated demand shocks have a positive impact on the slope factor as a result of the central bank policy response for offsetting the elevated inflation expectations. Finally, a risk shock is associated with a decrease in the curvature factor indicating that risk shocks influence the medium-term bonds due to the deflationary pressure resulting from depressed economic conditions. Practical implications: Our results provide new insights to understand the driving forces of yield curve movements induced by various oil shocks to formulate appropriate policy responses. Originality/value: The study contributes to the literature by two main dimensions. First, the recent oil shock identification scheme of Ready (2018) is modified using the “geopolitical oil price risk index” to capture the changes in the risk perceptions of oil markets driven by geopolitical tensions such as terrorism and conflicts and sanctions. The modified identification scheme attributes more power to demand shocks in explaining the variation of the oil price compared to that of the baseline scheme. Second, it provides recent evidence that distinguishes the impact of oil demand and supply shocks on Turkey's yield curve. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerging markets; Geopolitical oil price risks; Local projections; Oil price; Supply and demand shocks; Yield curve factors",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100977846

Specifically, it explores this in the context of the 2008 financial crisis in six banks located in two countries. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on 26 qualitative interviews with selected managers employed by the six banks. Eight interview guides were developed based on the typology of controls in Malmi and Brown (2008). Respondents explained which changes in management controls occurred after the crisis. Findings: Both organic and mechanistic management controls were mobilized at the same time to deal with the change. The use of controls played three main roles: (1) guide and control behavior, (2) change internal and external perceptions and (3) discharge accountability. Finally, control use during a crisis evolves as individual managers design and implement controls. There is no “grand design” rationally guiding the design of the overall system of controls. Originality/value: The use of management controls in dealing with an increase in uncertainty and hostility cannot be labeled either organic or mechanistic, but will depend on the specific type of change in environmental characteristics.

Methods: An online survey was developed, and comparative analyses were performed. Results: One hundred and sixty hospital leaders were invited, and 72% completed the questionnaire. Significant differences were found within three selected characteristics: 1) Management level: significantly more heads of departments experienced taking complex decisions (P=0.05), being able to work in a way consistent with their beliefs and values (P=0.05), and they were less likely to experience that collaboration with other leaders was adversely affected by the COVID-19 situation compared to ward managers (P=0.04). On the other hand, ward managers were significantly more often worried about both their own health (P=0.01) and their family’s health (P=0.04). 2) Management education: those with a formal management education more often experienced having the managerial competences to effectively manage the COVID-19 situation (P=0.00), and performing meaningful tasks during the situation (P=0.04). 3) Years of experience: significantly more leaders with more than five years of experience identified having the managerial competences to effectively manage the situation (P=0.01). Conclusion: Leadership support during a healthcare crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic should strategically focus on ward managers, leaders with no formal management education and leaders with less than two years of experience. Hospital leaders may use this knowledge to re-contextualize what is already known about targeted leadership support during health-care crises and to act accordingly. © 2021 Hølge-Hazelton et al.","Assessment; Clinical leadership; Communication; Management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100585571

We estimate a negative binomial regression model in a reduced form and by the use of control-functions, taking into account environmental regulation as well as more general determinants of innovation. Our results suggest that increased regulation has induced innovation in the wastewater treatment sector, both in the long and short run. The short-run effect was estimated to 40-70% in the years immediately following the introduction of new environmental regulations. A corresponding effect could not be identified in the agricultural sector. The difference between the sectors is likely explained by differences in policy design, where performance standards are applied in the wastewater sector, while design standards and technology-specific subsidies dominate in the agricultural sector. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Agriculture; environmental policy; eutrophication; patents; technological innovation; wastewater treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100278592

Based on Danish responses from 1053 employees and 290 managers of knowledge work, who had limited prior experience in distance management, our analysis revealed 12 items where managers found their work during lockdown to be more challenging than employees did. The implications are that research and practice should consider the well-being and performance consequences of WFH not only for employees but also for managers, as their experiences differ, and the managers express challenges in their leadership. © Operational Research Society 2021.","challenges; COVID-19; distance management; knowledge work; Managers; well-being; working from home",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100261980

The conceptual model consists of four forces leading to a successful business. Design/methodology/approach: The sample is a stratified one taken from KOMPASS directory and focussing on the Greater Manchester area. In total, 250 firms were chosen to be the population of this survey. In total, 110 surveys were received by email i.e. 24 non-exporters and 86 exporters that were fully completed. Findings: The four forces of the model include the non-exporting activity, the activity before and after the first export order, differences and similarities between non-exporters and exporters and the regular exporting activity. This model’s findings demonstrate important empirical determinants related to four forces, which, in turn, shape the successful exporting activity. Originality/value: The empirical evidence from the study suggests that the major differences between non-exporters and exporters, which include the differences in management perceptions towards exporting, and the differences and similarities of firm and management characteristics, explain only to some degree what constitutes successful exporting behaviour. The model is considered useful for smaller businesses located in the UK. The study highlights the importance of firms before and after the first export order, which provides insights for managers of firms about going through with the first export order rather than withdrawing from this effort. The study reveals the motivations for exporting, the timing, the modes through which firms export, firms’ management characteristics and attitudinal differences between exporters and non-exporters, which are essential for practitioners. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Activity before and after first export order; Differences between exporter vs non-exporters in management perceptions on exporting and management and firm characteristics; Differences between exporters and non-exporters in management and firm characteristics; Exporting and non-exporting behaviours; Non-exporting activity; Regular exporting activity; UK SMEs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100190207

For each country, the Human Opportunity Index, as developed by the World Bank, was calculated. Second, the contribution of each factor to that index was calculated. The results showed that while the Congo had relatively high employment dissimilarity, originating from given circumstances, Madagascar, Malawi, and Uganda had comparatively low employment dissimilarity indices. Likewise, the study detected that among factors beyond the control of youths that determined their chance to find employment, particularly parental occupation, was found to be a fundamental driver of creating a difference in employment chances for their offspring. Overall, the results implied that eﬀort-based inequalities and not inequality caused by factors beyond individual control played a significant role in explaining the status of youths in the labour market. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dissimilarity; employment; inequality of opportunity; Youth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100108153

An exploratory case study was conducted on the Scandic Hotels chain. Data utilised including both relevant reports and in-depth interviews with the highest level of management of Scandic. The execution of the sustainability hackathon illuminates how value-based education, creative problem-solving and co-opetition were critical aspects to foster EfS in the hospitality industry. Moreover, the hackathon facilitators, i.e. the hotels’ General Managers, were found to play an essential part in shaping the sustainability education and the event’s potential impacts. This paper contributes to expand knowledge on EfS offered by the hospitality industry (as opposed to EfS in formal educational institutions) and make practical recommendations on how sustainability hackathons could be better facilitated by hotel chains. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","education for sustainability; hotel chains; Sustainability hackathons; tourism; value-based education","education; hotel industry; sustainability; sustainable development; tourism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100033476

In addition to estimating the effects of the SEZs on poverty, the authors explore some of the possible mechanisms generating these effects. Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a difference-in-differences (DID) technique on a pooled, cross-sectional, district-level dataset based on official annual household surveys for the period from 2001 to 2012 to estimate the average effects of SEZs on household expenditure per capita, a commonly used measure of household poverty. Findings: The establishment of the SEZs constituted a major exogenous shock to rural economies by creating demand for large chunks of land, which had an immediate impact on the economic and social settings of these economies and aggravated rural poverty. However, over time the poverty aggravating effects of SEZs in rural areas dampened. The effects of SEZs on urban poverty are found to be different from those on rural poverty. It is also revealed that the districts with multiple SEZs experienced larger effects than those with only one or two SEZs. Overall, the SEZs did have positive expenditure effects, but this transition might have been accompanied by heightened inequality between the rural and urban areas. Research limitations/implications: First, the authors did not have access to village or municipal-level consumption data. It is therefore assumed here that district level performance is a reliable proxy for the relevant impacts of SEZ operations. Second, panel data, which would allow more precise measurement of effects than the pooled cross section data used in this study, are not available. Third, the authors’ econometric analysis is essentially comparative statics in nature and does not capture possible spillover dynamics, issues of relocation of economic activity, or migration. Practical implications: First, land acquisition is likely to emerge as a major political and social challenge for the localities that host SEZs. For effective policy implementation, it is necessary to establish legal institutions to address this challenge. Second, governments in developing countries often announce new SEZ programmes on a very large scale and insist that they be implemented over short periods of time. The authors recommend that the government should adopt an experimental approach in implementing the policy. Third, the authors provide evidence that in the long run, effects of SEZs hinge on the success of SEZs in attracting investment and generating additional employment. The policy must therefore be informed by rigorous analysis of the potential of SEZs in the country, as well as alternative policy options. Social implications: The authors’ results show that large-scale land acquisitions to implement large industrial projects are likely to result in shocks to the rural economy exacerbating rural-urban inequalities: village communities lose their resource base, are marginalised in the process, and, as a result, face economic deprivations. It may lead to severe economic, social and political consequences. The authors’ study implies that any strategy for large-scale industrialisation should take cognisance of its effects on the affected communities and should be designed to include strategies to improve their economic opportunities and to ensure social inclusion. Originality/value: SEZs are one of the most controversial topics within development policy discourse. Their regional development effects are subject to intense debate.

We point to two crucial aspects in which we think her arguments need to be extended, namely: (a) embracing the constitutive role of communication for organizational actorhood and agency, and (b) rethinking the role of PR in the constitution of organizational actors. We argue that such extension would allow for an important and radical twist in perspective that highlights a widely neglected question in PR research: What if the collective actorhood status of organizations is not treated as a given but rather arises from communicative attributions of such actorhood status to social entities? Finally, we develop key implications from this shift in perspective for PR scholarship, education, and practice. © The Author(s) 2021.","Agency; communicative institutionalism; institutional theory; organizational actorhood; public relations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099500655

Methods: Five databases were searched on the 15/12/2019. Studies were included when containing original research published in apeer-reviewed journal around female competitive football of any level, any age and on any subject. Author, journal, title and abstract of all included studies were scoped. Population assessed number of participants, level of play, age level of football and publication theme(s) were extracted. Results: A total of 1,634 articles were scoped. The oldest publication dated back to 1939, whilst atotal of 202 studies were gathered from 2019. The publication theme most frequently researched was sports medicine (N = 521) followed by strength and conditioning (N = 331) and sociology (N = 299). The majority of studies has focussed on elite (N = 442), senior (N = 977) players. Conclusion: A continuous growth in research attention has been seen. However, the numbers are not comparable to current research output levels in men’s football.

The model emphasises the importance of understanding the evolution of digital affordances as possessing teleological paths where affordances are developed in steps corresponding to where an organisation focuses its managerial attention, with indirect consequences of possibilities to attend to other objectives enabled by digital technologies.

In our empirical study with a sample of more than 163,000 ideas collected from the Xiaomi MIUI community, we analyse influencing factors that increase the likelihood of ideas being preselected or reviewed. Results show that user status, user initiative contribution, and community recognition have a significantly positive influence on idea preselction, whereas user response contribution has no influence.

Further, we suggest that the likelihood and prevalence of this logic of action is both situational and dispositional, as individual and contextual factors combine to generate important differences in the resource mobilization activities of the entrepreneurs.

The neglect in managing NCDs during emergencies may result in fatal consequences for individuals living with comorbidities. This paper aims to highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the governance of public health emergencies to simultaneously address NCD and noncommunicable disease (CD) pandemics while taking into account the needs of high-risk populations, underlying etiological factors, and the social, economic, and environmental determinants that are relevant for both CDs and NCDs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the available global frameworks for pandemic preparedness to highlight the governance challenges of addressing the dual agenda of NCDs and CDs during a public health emergency. It proposes key strategies to strengthen multilevel governance in support of countries to better prepare for public health emergencies through the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders across sectors. Findings: Addressing both CD and NCD pandemics during public health emergencies requires (1) a new framework that unites the narratives and overcomes service and system fragmentations; (2) a multisectoral and multistakeholder governance mechanism empowered and resourced to include stakeholders across sectors and (3) a prioritized research agenda to understand the political economy of pandemics, the role played by different political systems and actors and implementation challenges, and to identify combined strategies to address the converging agendas of CDs and NCDs. Research limitations/implications: The article is based on the review of available published evidence.

We show that if the upstream firm is organized like a traditional cooperative, where the members have free delivery rights and where surplus is shared in proportion to the deliveries, the downstream firm is less subject to a holdup. The cooperative form makes it possible for the upstream firm to credibly commit to deliveries. Traditional cooperatives are often considered as suffering from a volume management problem, which leads to excessive deliveries. Remedying this problem is the objective of the so-called new generation cooperatives. In a supply chain context, however, this problem may actually be beneficial. Specifically, it limits the upstream firm's ability to hold up the downstream firm, which in turn makes possible specific downstream investments that are closer to first best. Our model lends structure to several real-world phenomena, including the apparent success of marketing cooperatives in farming, the success of open-end mutual funds, and the organization of aggregators in the new economy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cooperative; Holdup; Volume control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097883005

This work analyses the current possibilities and limitations of MAM for plastic injection moulding tool applications, demonstrating the opportunity to limit post-processes to heat treatment and the machining of the MAM insert outer geometry, which was only intended to ensure the assembly of the insert in the injection moulding frame. The results focused on evaluating the as-built insert cavity geometrical characteristics and the dimensional replication performance of the injection moulding process. The as-built cavity surface texture was comparable to a surface roughness that would be alternatively manufactured by electrical discharge machining (EDM). The cavity texture and features was replicated to the plastic injection moulded samples with an average replication fidelity higher than 95 %, enabling the direct production of inserts with integrated enhanced surface properties and aesthetics. Additional geometrical characteristics, such as global cavity dimensions, corner radii, and the staircase effect of selected features, typical of MAM products, were examined to gather further knowledge of the MAM process resolution and the corresponding replication capabilities of the IM process. Additional considerations with regards to the insert mechanical loading conditions and its durability in terms of the expected fatigue lifetime were addressed, verifying the usability of the MAM insert for production batches of at least 2⋅106 injection moulding cycles. Finally, the improvements in terms of lead-time reduction and production costs associated with MAM compared with conventional tooling technologies were evaluated and discussed, confirming the potential of the presented process chain of MAM for injection moulding tools production. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Additive manufacturing; Fatigue; Moulding; Process Chain; Production cost; Surface; Tooling","3D printers; Additives; Costs; Electric discharge machining; Electric discharges; Geometry; Heat treatment; Plastics industry; Surface roughness; Textures; Electrical discharge machining; Finishing operation; Geometrical characteristics; Industrial adoption; Injection moulding tools; Lead time reduction; Mechanical loading; Production batches; Injection molding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097577314

We argue that theories of class, which are today seldom used in critical diversity research, have the potential to conceptualize the relationship between difference and power in ways that go beyond the current focus on equality within capitalist organizations. Theories of class radicalize diversity research by providing a conceptual vocabulary to ground the critique of diversity in the critique of capitalism. To highlight this potential, we first reconstruct the ideological historical context of the 1980s in which diversity research emerged, re-embedding it in a broader political project to restructure the economy, work and society as a whole. We then present four main uses of the concept of class in management and organization studies and the theoretical traditions that underpin them. We go on to introduce the four contributions to this Special Section, illustrating how class, variously understood, can inform critical understandings of diversity. We conclude by leveraging class within four strategies for more radical diversity scholarship: classing workers, occupations, and workplaces; classing diversity; classing meritocracy; and classing struggles for social justice. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","capitalism; class; diversity; equal opportunities; inequality; meritocracy; radicalism; social justice",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097379294

Recent and ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political-economic and planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article reinterprets the supply chain as a social–ecological system and leaves behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary vision of “dancing the supply chain.” A panarchy is a structure of adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of time, space, and meaning.

A quantitative survey conducted among German smartphone users across different age groups reveals that both intrinsic and extrinsic beliefs determine consumer acceptance of m-shopping, while consumer shopping orientations shape the beliefs of m-shopping. In particular, the greater the consumers’ brand consciousness, novelty-seeking tendency, and impulsiveness the greater the perceived usefulness and/or enjoyment of m-shopping; however, consumers’ convenience consciousness weakens the perceived enjoyment. The results further indicate that the effects of shopping orientations on the beliefs are largely independent of the type of m-shopping touchpoint (i.e., m-app and m-browser).

Although the positive implications of SHRM for hospital performance are well known and commonly accepted in research and practice, hospitals still vary in its use. However, the sources of variations in hospitals' use of SHRM are largely unknown. PURPOSE: Various organizational and environmental factors were used in this study to explain the variations in hospitals' use of SHRM for physicians and nurses. METHODOLOGY: Data were obtained from a hospital survey (n = 172) on topics related to human resource management in hospitals and linked to different secondary data sets. We apply multiple linear regression modeling to investigate the association between organizational and environmental characteristics and hospitals' use of SHRM for nurses and physicians. FINDINGS: Our results suggest that organizational factors such as private for-profit and nonprofit ownership (compared to public ownership), academic teaching status, and the strategic involvement of the human resource administration are positively associated with hospitals' use of SHRM. None of the environmental factors investigated in this study was significantly related to hospitals' use of SHRM. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The study results increase our understanding of variations in hospitals' use of SHRM. Although organizational characteristics were found to explain variations in SHRM, environmental factors seem unrelated with hospitals' use of SHRM. Our results inform both hospital managers and policy makers about possible approaches to enhance SHRM use in hospitals. Furthermore, profound knowledge about factors associated with SHRM will help to enhance our understanding of anticipating changes in hospitals' use of SHRM through organizational- and environmental-oriented interventions.",,"health care personnel; hospital; human; organization and management; physician; Health Personnel; Hospitals; Humans; Ownership; Physicians; Workforce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096888548

To achieve a better understanding of the nature of these conflicts and how consumers cope with them, we study identities related to meat consumption and how they are organized. Identity theories are used as the lens to address the self-relevance of meat to consumers. Thirteen Danish consumers shared how and why they ate, reduced, or avoided meat in a food-based photo-diary and in-depth interviews, supported by a visualization approach, developed from self-brand connection methods. Three higher-order identities (pragmatic idealist, ethical foodie, and healthy hedonist) emerged, governing the consumption, reduction, or avoidance of different meat categories. Identity conflicts between health, moral (e.g., animal welfare), and hedonic concerns were present, but also identity stigma. Coping mechanisms include change of salience and changing patterns of meat consumption. Campaigners promoting a reduction in meat consumption and developers of alternative protein foods can use these insights to target identities and facilitate conflict resolutions. However, more research is needed on how generalizable results are. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","coping mechanisms; environmental sustainability; identity conflict; meat consumption; multiple identities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096767906

The platform ecosystem literature has mainly focused on indirect network effects arising from the quantity of complements, with little attention to the quality of complements, despite the importance of quality for the complementary value that drives platform ecosystems. Because digital products are malleable and dependent on the ever-evolving ecosystem, we advance a relational and dynamic conceptualization of complement quality. Drawing on a systematic, in-depth qualitative case study of the Philips Hue connected lighting platform and its complementary third-party apps, we study how and why complement quality is sustained over time. By analyzing apps and their updates, we developed a process model that explains pathways through which complement quality is enhanced, maintained, or deteriorates. Changes in the platform core, changes in other ecosystem elements, and idiosyncratic connections by users result in expanding affordances, materializing glitches, and emerging obsolescence. Without further action, glitches and obsolescence lead to deteriorating quality. Joint action of complementors, platform owners, and users is needed to act upon affordances, glitches, and obsolescence, in order to maintain integrity and enhance functionality. This paper contributes to the literature on innovation in platform ecosystems by explaining the dynamic and relational nature of complement quality in a digital platform ecosystem and showing the interdependence of ecosystem members (the triad between platform owner, complementors, and users) in sustained development efforts. © 2020 Product Development & Management Association",,"Obsolescence; Complementary products; Core technology; Digital platforms; Digital products; Indirect network effects; Platform ecosystems; Process Modeling; Qualitative case studies; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096702901

Effective decision support systems (DSS) should be user-friendly, provide transparency, and support human judgement. There is a wide range of optimisation models that aim to improve the outcome of network design decisions. However, their practical performance often remains unknown, as their implementation into the managerial decision process is largely neglected. Such theory-driven models usually focus on single aspects of the decision, without being able to accommodate the practical problem comprehensively. We employ the CIMO approach to resolve the issue and contribute by showing how an integration involving these methods can be useful for managers once the proper knowledge transfer has been effectuated. An innovative decision support framework, which combines mixed-integer linear programming, the Analytical Hierarchy Process, and the Pareto front is created and analysed during a case study in the med-tech industry. Results show that the framework accommodates managerial experience, integrates qualitative as well as quantitative criteria, and provides transparency over the entire range of efficient solutions. The framework and application results contribute towards the development of more flexible and easy-to-use decision support systems for GSCND. © 2020 The Author(s).

These transitions must be rapid, but also fair. An emerging body of evidence suggests that users have important roles in transitions, yet much previous research has examined user involvement while assuming it to be largely a positive force. This goes against a growing amount of evidence within sociotechnical studies that highlight the potentially obstructive or negative role that users may play in transitions and innovation. In this study, we pose a critical question: In what ways may users perpetuate injustices within a transition? To answer this question, we provide conceptual background on energy justice and user adoption of low-carbon energy and mobility technologies. We then analyse users and energy injustices in three low-carbon transitions–solar energy in Germany, electric vehicles in Norway, and smart meters in Great Britain–based on empirical data from interviews, focus groups, and internet forums. Our main contribution is to show how users in low-carbon transitions are not always positively engaged, or even neutral, but can introduce and contribute to inequality and exclusion. © 2020 The Author(s).

Previous studies have either anticipated the impact of individual technologies or outlined a number of nontechnology-focused future scenarios. There is comparatively little work on how innovation champions frame the future by combining a range of digital technologies and trends (such as big data, the internet of things, and automation) to transform construction. Drawing on an interview-based study with UK construction professionals, this paper presents three emergent visions for digital transformation of the sector. These visions are efficient construction, user-data-driven built environment, and value-driven computational design. Arising in practitioner narratives, these visions all emphasize different technologies and are partially influenced, intertwined, and interconnected with technology, business, and policy discourses in the sector. Furthermore, the visions represent different trajectories for implementing digital technologies in the construction sector. This paper contributes to work on construction foresight and innovation discourses by articulating the multiplicity of visions for digital transformation of construction. This has implications for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers responsible for the digital transformation of construction toward possible, profitable, and desirable futures. © 2020 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",,"Civil engineering; Engineering; Built environment; Computational design; Construction sectors; Digital technologies; Digital transformation; Efficient construction; Individual technology; Policy discourse; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095971840

This paper first accounts for mechanisms that may drive heritage of practices from parent organizations to their spawns. It then sets out to explore mechanisms that may cause a lower degree of diversity in applied practices among established organizations, and lastly, the conditions that may cause a greater degree of diversity among practice combinations of startups. The reviewed mechanisms suggest that the distribution of organizational and strategic practices among established organizations and startups to be somewhat dissimilar, and that startups significantly contribute to the variation in organizational practices. Using a sample set of Danish organizations, we find evidence of greater diversity in organizational practices among newer organizations, while established organizations are more likely to converge on a set of similar practices.

When R=r then Extended Erlangian is the same as pure Erlangian and the simple Markov model presented by Johansen (2005) makes it easy to compute and minimize the long-run average cost per unit time. We present an algorithm to compute the steady state distribution of a new Markov model for base-stock control with Extended Erlangian LTs. For fixed base-stock S, this algorithm can be applied to compute the average cost and it is straightforward (but burdensome for large r) to compute the optimal S and the minimum average cost. We also suggest a reasonable S computed in closed form from simple models with pure Erlangian LTs. The reasonable S is easy to compute and it performs well.

Whether these studies accumulate comparable knowledge about PSM crucially depends on PSM measurement invariance: that PSM has a similar measurement structure in different national contexts. Yet, large-scale cross-country research to address this conundrum remains scant. Drawing on an original survey of 23,000 public servants in ten countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, our paper addresses this gap. Replicating Kim et al.’s 16-item scale, we find partial metric invariance for the four PSM dimensions in eight countries, but scalar non-invariance. This suggests that results from structural equations about the causes and consequences of PSM may be compared across most countries, yet means of PSM and its dimensions are not generally comparable. PSM research thus cannot adjudicate in which countries public service motivation is higher or lower on average but can compare relationships between PSM and individual characteristics or management practices between countries.

Nonetheless, empirical research using simple heuristics as a theory of managerial or organisational cognition remains sparse. To stimulate empirical research, we propose concrete avenues for research, starting with the empirical problems and then considering how simple heuristics can be used as a lens to address these issues. We illustrate our argument by focusing on empirical problems involved in project decisions. Specifically, we discuss three problems that both pose a challenge and offer an opportunity for simple heuristic research: decision (or problem) framing, acquisition and use of unstructured information, and identification of options. We discuss these challenges along two views: the use of heuristics through the practitioner and the development of heuristics in the context of the organisational environment. Our article contributes to the research on project decision making through concrete guidance for designing empirically relevant research within the simple heuristic paradigm, as well as to the simple heuristic community by extending the research into novel empirical problems and methodological approaches. © 2020","Decision-making; Project decisions; Research agenda; Simple heuristics","Heuristic methods; Decision problems; Decisions makings; Empirical problems; Empirical research; Organisational; Project decision; Research agenda; Simple heuristics; Simple++; Through the lens; Decision making; decision making; empirical analysis; heuristics; project management; research; social change; technological change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092398318

To improve our understanding of this persistent problem, this article examines gender equality practitioners in relation to the wider discursive context of Danish society. Theorizing Denmark as a “postfeminist gender regime,” I analyze how practitioners negotiate a space for action in a context which generally opposes gender equality initiatives. I introduce the notion of “maneuvering” as a way to understand this negotiation between hegemonic, postfeminist discourses, on the one hand, and marginal and potentially subversive discourses on the other. Practitioners may maneuver in how they understand inequality and potential solutions, and in the meetings between them, their work and the postfeminist gender regime. Successful maneuvering enables the use of more radical change strategies than postfeminism otherwise allows. Practitioners' ability to maneuver rests on their critical reflexivity, which in turn is conditioned by their knowledge of gender and power dynamics. The study thus points to the centrality of selecting highly qualified individuals as gender equality practitioners. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","academia; choice; gender equality work; gender essentialism; maneuvering; postfeminism","feminism; gender issue; gender relations; hegemony; power relations; theoretical study; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092316561

Within the overall conceptual focus of peace engineering, we analyze the operations and activities of six Turkish firms operating in the violence-hit and fragile countries of Congo, Ethiopia, Iraq, Morocco (the Western Sahara region), Somalia, and Sudan. The findings indicate that foreign firms operating in fragile and conflict-affected countries, along with achieving business goals, contribute significantly to the skills development of local employees and establish legitimacy through forging social connections and adopting corporate social responsibility activities. Their support for skills development resulted in career advancement opportunities and, in some cases, entrepreneurial ventures that were initiated by local employees. We argue that, despite precarious and unpredictable conditions, the operations of such firms can provide economic incentives as well as increased well-being and long-term stability in such contexts.

The paper is based on an extensive review of nine urban planning documents and interviews with five environment and/or e-waste related institutions and informal e-waste recyclers at the Agbogbloshie Processing Site in Accra, Ghana. Findings of the paper showed that urban planning has been ineffective in positively shaping Ghana's e-waste sector. Urban planning initiatives on e-waste management have remained reactionary, instead of becoming future-oriented. There is insufficient e-waste related policies and a general lack of focus on e-waste management. Officials reported of logistical and financial constraints, weak agency framework and coordination; a situation which have hampered efforts in employing urban planning as a tool to managing Ghana's e-waste sector. An important entry point is the need to consciously understand, localise and integrate e-waste issues into urban planning efforts. This should be done by recognising the importance of improving awareness on e-waste issues; finding a place for informal e-waste recycling through re-examination of existing planning regimes; and developing a clear and efficient institutional framework for an improved sector and a more sustainable urban environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Electrical and electrical equipment (EEE); Electronic waste (e-waste); Planning policy; Urban planning","electronic waste; equipment; sustainable development; trend analysis; urban planning; urban policy; waste management; Accra; Ghana; Greater Accra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091893970

Yet empirical evidence about these matters is scarce. In this article, we investigate how social media algorithms influence activists’ actualization of collective affordances. Empirically, we build on an ethnographic study of two SM organizations based in Tunisia. The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, we provide a theoretical framework that specifies how algorithms condition the actualization of three collective affordances (interlinking, assembling, augmenting). Specifically, we show how these affordances are supported by algorithmic facilitation, that is, operations pertaining to the sorting of interactions and actors, the filtering of information, and the ranking and aggregation of content. Secondly, we extend the understanding of how social media platforms’ profit-orientation undermines collective action. Namely, we identify how algorithms introduce constraints for organizing processes, manifested as algorithmic distortion, that is, information overload, opacity, and disinformation. We conclude by discussing the detrimental implications of social media algorithms for organizing and civic engagement, as activists are often unaware of the interests of social media-owning corporations. © The Author(s) 2020.","Algorithms; collective action; collective affordances; social media; social movements",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091889687

While digitisation promises great improvements in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, not everyone is convinced that digitisation will always lead to the hoped for benefits. In this article, I explore a number of prominent concerns that Danish fire safety professionals have raised with regards to ongoing efforts to digitise their knowledge and expertise. The focus on digitisation is deliberate, as I suggest that scrutinising the implications and concerns raised by professionals in digitisation can help us foresee unintended, potentially dangerous, consequences, of digitalisation. In building on anthropological fieldwork, I argue that professionals are concerned about digitising fire safety, and its potentially dark results, because they worry that digitisation may dislocate ‘mētis’ from ‘techne’, and that digital outputs may be misunderstood or not applied correctly. Such a turn of events could lead not just to material losses (e.g. destroyed buildings), but to the loss of human lives too. This ‘concern’ with life and death thus appears to underpin the fire safety professionals’ belief in the importance of dialogue in organizationally complex circumstances, and their hesitance to engage with digitisation.

Extant research that addresses this topic in an open innovation context, suggests that firms that engage in open innovation tend to delegate authority over innovation decisions. We provide a more nuanced argument that considers important contingencies. Thus, we argue that the extent of delegation depends upon the combined effect of the relative importance of innovation decisions to the firm's strategy and, when a firm engages in open innovation, on the nature of the external knowledge (scientific vs. practical) that it seeks to absorb from the external environment.

Moreover, our findings show that firms’ different organizational structures affect their adaptations to exploratory outcomes.

While the occupational safety and health (OSH) coordinator has been a key actor in European efforts proposed to improve OSH in the industry since 1992, it is important to study the competences needed for the successful coordination of OSH in the construction industry. Existing literature on OSH coordinator competences are examined, and an expert survey is used to identify the competences characterising the most successful coordinators in Denmark. Finally, observational case studies of the perceived most successful coordinators in the Danish construction industry are used to exemplify the newly identified competences. The most frequently mentioned competences, not covered in previous research, are “innovativeness,” “having overview,” “persistency,” “thoroughness,” “sociability,” and “being systematic.” The results demonstrate the important “practice of knowing,” rather than possessing formal knowledge, education, and/or skills. The most important practice of knowing for the coordinators is likely that of the ability to transfer knowledge into practice.

However, consumer inattention and lack of information are ubiquitous, especially in household energy-related settings. Thus, using a novel survey and actual monthly electricity consumption data, this study set out to measure the level of awareness about electricity bills, prices and costs among some Finnish households—as captured by the answers to six questions—and to investigate whether higher levels of “electricity awareness” are associated with electricity savings. In addition, this study analyses the willingness to receive extra information about energy consumption and savings and how it differs between “electricity aware” and “electricity unaware” respondents. The results indicate low levels of “electricity awareness” among the respondents of the survey. Compared to the respondents with little knowledge about electricity bills, prices and costs, the respondents with higher levels of “electricity awareness” tend to consume less electricity. Higher levels of awareness about electricity use and consumption might “materialize” inconspicuous consumption patterns, as opposed to more general facts about the largely invisible environmental consequences of everyday practices. More than two-thirds of the total number of respondents would like to receive additional information about energy consumption and how to save energy. However, there exists a significant portion of “electricity unaware” respondents who are not only unwilling to receive such information, but are also unaware of their own knowledge deficits. To maximize the impact of any information strategy, decision makers should attempt to engage with this type of consumer; by becoming more aware of their knowledge deficits, people might become more receptive to information that can benefit them. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","electricity awareness; electricity demand; Finnish households; information; residential buildings; self-assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091008371

Based on the possible bioprocess routes created from implied technologies, thirteen scenarios were developed to perform mass and energy balances as well as environmental life cycle assessments. Subsequently, a general superstructure-based multi-criteria decision making model was designed representing possible technologies at each stage of biomass processing and their interconnections. The optimal biorefining route for achieving a sustainability solution was selected based on energetic, economic, and environmental aspects; three objective functions for maximizing energy saving and profitability, and minimizing greenhouse gas emissions. The results achieved in this study demonstrated that the scenario including anaerobic digestion of organic fraction of municipal solid waste coupled with a biological biogas upgrading unit for bio-methanation of biogas into fuel-grade bioCH4 was the most sustainable biorefining route. This scenario led to a greenhouse gas saving of 243.4 kg CO2 eq/t biopulp and a primary energy saving of 4664.77 MJ/t biopulp, creating a profit of 145.41 €/t biopulp. On the contrary, biosuccinic acid production with cogeneration of heat &amp; power and bioCH4 with further use as home cooking fuel found to be the least preference for biowaste valorization.

This is much more urgent for the developing world with a high level of food insecurity. However, driving factors contributing to the changes of FL are poorly understood. Here, we report on an investigation into the contribution of five potential driving factors to FL in Cameroon between 1994 and 2013, using a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) approach. The results showed that FL in Cameroon has increased more than 4 fold during the study period. The increase of FL per unit crop production (intensity effect) contributed the most to increase FL (36.87% of the total change), followed by the increase of per capita crop consumption, i.e. supply scale effect (34.55%), population growth (26.72%), and changes of crop production structure, i.e. structure effect (5.079%). Only the dependency on self-production (self-sufficiency effect) contributed to decrease FL (3.22%). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cameroon; Driving factors; Food loss; Food security; Index decomposition analysis","Cultivation; Developing countries; Food supply; Food waste; Population statistics; Crop production; Developing world; Driving factors; Driving force analysis; Intensity effect; Logarithmic mean; Population growth; Structure effect; Crops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090192177

Through a longitudinal, exploratory qualitative case study of a large firm, this article investigates how organizational members respond to an ambidextrous organizing model designed to accelerate digital innovations. The firm relied on a hybrid model of separation and integration to organize and manage its digital transformation efforts. This study unfolds the implications and consequences of such a model at the micro-level. By applying a paradox lens, it shows how the coping actions of organizational members affected the digital transformation. The article illustrates how the hybrid organizing model led to the emergence of three paradoxes at the organizational level (paradoxes of organizing, attention, and knowledge sharing) that organizational members had to cope with. It shows how organizational members, through their coping with these paradoxes, indirectly affected the organizing model by altering its original design; and how the management, influenced by these learnings, subsequently adapted the model to enable a better sustainability over time. Overall, the findings show and explain why organizing for digital transformation is a particularly complex and paradoxical endeavor. They also provide important insights to managers and organizational developers, helping them to become aware of possible tensions in their organizing efforts as well as of coping strategies and practices to tackle these tensions. Finally, the article suggests different paths for further research in digital transformation and digital innovation from a micro-level perspective. © 2020 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Coping strategies; Digital innovations; Digital transformation; Hybrid model; Knowledge-sharing; Organizational levels; Original design; Qualitative case studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090084848

We assume several demand classes, where the demands of each class follow a compound Poisson process, and a stochastic replenishment lead-time common to all classes. For this inventory system, we investigate two rationing policies that can be employed when the inventory level is critically low. The first policy is the reservation policy, where a part of the stock is reserved for high priority demand classes, whereas the second one is new, which we call a threshold policy, and accepts demands of a given class until the pipeline stock caused by the particular class (plus the amount of the incoming order) reaches a critical level. On average, for 8% (12%) of all instances, the threshold policy performs better than the reservation policy under the full (partial) lost sales case and when the objective is to minimise the average on-hand inventory subject to fill rate service requirements. Furthermore, in many cases where the reservation policy outperforms the threshold policy, the gap between the two policies is small under both service requirements and total cost minimisation criteria. This suggests that a trade-off between ‘fairness’ and ‘cost’ is required, and that when the performance of two policies are similar, the threshold policy is generally favoured. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","base-stock; compound poisson processes; Inventory; Markov chain; prioritisation of customer classes","Economic and social effects; Stochastic systems; Compound Poisson process; Inventory systems; On-hand inventory; Reservation policy; Service requirements; Spare parts inventories; Stochastic replenishments; Threshold policies; Inventory control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090084540

Academic engagement is also socially conditioned by peer effects and disciplinary characteristics. In terms of consequences, academic engagement is positively associated with academics’ subsequent scientific productivity.

This discussion paper aims to offer a set of principles, grounded in knowledge from various disciplines that can guide researchers in designing, implementing, and evaluating organizational interventions. Inspired by Mode 2 knowledge production, the principles were developed through a transdisciplinary, participatory and iterative process where practitioners and academics were invited to develop, refine and validate the principles. The process resulted in 10 principles: 1) Ensure active engagement and participation among key stakeholders; 2) Understand the situation (starting points and objectives); 3) Align the intervention with existing organizational objectives; 4) Explicate the program logic; 5) Prioritize intervention activities based on effort-gain balance; 6) Work with existing practices, processes, and mindsets; 7) Iteratively observe, reflect, and adapt; 8) Develop organizational learning capabilities; 9) Evaluate the interaction between intervention, process, and context; and 10) Transfer knowledge beyond the specific organization. The principles suggest how the design, implementation, and evaluation of organizational interventions can be researched in a way that maximizes both practical and scientific impact. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, the diversity and abundance of syntrophic communities and their ecological determinants remain largely unexplored. In this study, we aimed to unravel the impacts of soil type and rice phenology on both syntrophic and methanogenic communities. The relative abundances of syntrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea were significantly affected by soil type and rice growth stages, with 0.39–1.66% and 1.68–3.95% for syntrophic bacteria and 0.49–6.04% and 9.29–13.69% for methanogenic archaea, respectively. Besides, the populations of short-chain fatty acid-degrading syntrophs (SFAS) varied across soil types (range: 8.21 × 106–7.83 × 107 16S rRNA gene copies g−1 dry soil) and rice growth stages (range: 2.27 × 107–3.88 × 107 16S rRNA gene copies g−1 dry soil). Moreover, the populations of syntrophic propionate-oxidizing bacteria were 1.2–6.2 times higher than those of butyrate-oxidizing bacteria in the 10 paddy soils during the off-rice season, indicating that propionate is the main intermediate product during anaerobic decomposition of organic matter. However, Syntrophomonas was the most dominant throughout the rice growing season, implying that syntrophic pathways may vary between off-rice and growing seasons. Interestingly, the populations of SFAS and methanogens showed a significantly positive correlation (P &lt; 0.05). This suggests that syntrophic bacteria, in cooperation with methanogenic archaea, can affect methane production in paddy soils. Furthermore, C/N ratio, soil moisture, soil pH, oxalate, citrate, and their interaction accounted for 65.20% of the changes in syntrophic communities. Altogether, our findings indicate that soil type, rice phenological stages and soil properties can shape the distribution of syntrophic communities in rice paddy fields. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Fatty acid-degrading syntrophs; Methanogens; Rice phenological stages; Soil properties; Soil type","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Genes; Organic compounds; RNA; Soil moisture; Volatile fatty acids; Anaerobic decomposition; Intermediate product; Methane production; Methanogenic archaea; Methanogenic community; Microbial metabolic process; Positive correlations; Short-chain fatty acids; Population statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089562885

Therefore, the sustainability of food supply chains has gained ground; however, the sustainability of perishable food supply chains, is still not a fully explored field of study. Therefore, in this research, a multi-objective mathematical programming model is developed to optimize the cost, energy consumption, and the traffic congestion associated with such supply chain operations. In this study, product lifetime uncertainty is explicitly modeled as a Weibull random variable, and food perishability is assumed to be affected by vehicle refrigerator utilization, which is considered as a decision variable. In addition, multiple vehicle types and multiple product types are considered. A dairy supply chain case is investigated, and the interrelations and interactions of all three aspects of sustainability, also known as the three triple bottom lines (TBL) of sustainability, are studied. The results indicate that emphasizing the economic aspect, for highly perishable products, the environmental impact of the chain may increase by 120%, and for the highly congested road networks, the social impact may rise by 51%. However, a 15% economic compromise can improve the sustainability of the supply chain network design by 150%. It is also shown that road congestion and the uncertain perishability of the products are critical factors that can, although differently, affect the operation and the design of the supply chain. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Zero Hunger (SDG 2); Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12); Climate Action (SDG 13) and Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16).

As a result, production ramp-ups have become more frequent in many industries, and they now often account for a significant share of the entire product lifecycle. Due to the prominent role production ramp-ups play in the lifecycle of a product, efficient production ramp-ups are now an important determinant of business success. This work proposes a mathematical model for managing production ramp-ups in a serial multi-stage production system. In the scenario considered here, both the productivity of workers and demand increase over time until a steady-state phase is reached at the end of the ramp-up. The model proposed in this paper supports the assignment of workers to the different stages of the production system and the balancing of production and demand to ensure a smooth transition from the production ramp-up to steady-state production. The model is analysed in numerical experiments to illustrate its potential for managing the production ramp-up. Our experiments show that high learning rates can have drawbacks in terms of large inventories if learning is not aligned with demand growth and across production stages. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","demand growth; learning effect; multi-stage production system; Production ramp-up","Production control; Customer requirements; Environmental dynamics; Multi-stage production systems; Numerical experiments; Product life cycles; Production Planning; Production ramp-up; Steady state production; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089017258

However, despite the emerging empirical studies in the area known as “Behavioural OR”, there is still a dearth of research into how artefacts are used at the micro-level of OR practice. This article addresses this gap by using adaptive structuration theory (AST) to study the appropriation (use) of artefacts during a facilitated modelling (FM) workshop. We argue that the appropriation of artefacts from the workshop participants enables them to engage in negotiation of meaning with action implications effectively, but appropriation occurs at varying intensities (high, medium, and low) depending on the issue of concern. Moreover, we identify that artefacts are reproduced if their reproduction is an aim or part of an aim of strategic discourse. Finally, we outline the limitations of our study and future research avenues. © Operational Research Society 2020.","adaptive structuration theory; appropriation intensity; artefact; behavioural OR; Facilitated modelling","Operations research; Research; Adaptive structuration theory; Black boxes; Empirical studies; Micro level; Negotiation of meaning; Operational research; Workshop participants; Cell proliferation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088935454

We do this in two laboratory eye tracking experiments. In our first experiment (n = 193), we identify heterogeneity in the decision to cheat. Some decisions on whether to cheat or be honest exhibit relatively little variation and appear to be oriented towards cheating (or honesty) with apparently little consideration of the alternative, whereas other decisions seem to be characterized by a higher degree of consideration for both decision alternatives.

Since such complementors promise continuous value co-creation, complementor dedication is an essential objective of platform governance. However, as dedicated complementors also increase their vulnerability vis-à-vis the platform owner, platform governance needs to strike a balance between satisfying global ecosystem needs and the local partnership needs. To understand this challenge better, our study develops six hypotheses on how two fundamental governance mechanisms–i.e., rules and the way in which these rules are practised–independently and symbiotically drive complementor dedication. We test these hypotheses using survey data from 181 complementors. Our findings show that complementors become more dedicated to a platform owner, the more adequate they perceive the rules to be. Furthermore, our findings suggest two sensible strategies to actualise the potential of adequate rules. Platform owners should either refrain entirely from practising rules with situational flexibility and benevolence, thereby achieving moderate complementor dedication. Alternatively, they should practice rules with both flexibility and benevolence at the same time, thereby maximising complementor dedication.

The analysis shows that state-of-the-art techniques have limitations in preserving data privacy, such as (i) the necessary trade-off between privacy and forecasting accuracy, empirically evaluated through simulations and real-world experiments based on solar data; and (ii) iterative model fitting processes, which reveal data after a number of iterations. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","ADMM; Forecasting; Privacy-preserving; Time series; Vector autoregression",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087212884

In this paper, we propose a novel bagging estimator designed for such predictors. Based on a test for finite-sample predictive ability, our estimator shrinks the ordinary least squares estimate—not to zero, but towards the null of the test that equates squared bias with estimation variance. We apply bagging to reduce the estimation variance further. We derive the asymptotic distribution and show that our estimator substantially lowers the mean-squared error compared to standard t-test bagging. An asymptotic shrinkage representation for the estimator that simplifies the computation is provided. Monte Carlo simulations showed that the predictor works well with small samples. Empirically, we found that our proposed estimator worked well for inflation forecasting when using unemployment or industrial production as predictors. In an application for predicting equity premiums, the combination of our estimator and a positive constraint on forecasts delivered statistically significant gains relative to the historical average using a wide range of predictors. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Bootstrap aggregation; Equity premium predictions; Estimation uncertainty; Inflation forecasting; Shrinkage methods; Weak predictors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087210393

Empirical evidence has shown that customers are willing to pay a higher price for a faster and more reliable service. In this study, we address the interactions between the price, promised delivery time, and delivery-reliability level in a competitive setting. We model the problem as a competition among an arbitrary number of profit-maximizing firms facing boundedly rational customers who can choose to buy the service from one of the firms or balk. We prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium and propose a simple iterative algorithm that converges to the equilibrium. Furthermore, we compare our results with those in the existing literature and report interesting managerial insights.

Consequently, it can be used to determine the number of transport trips and their organisation in time and space needed for the timely delivery of material to specific loading/unloading points.

Corporate social responsibility performance is measured with a composite ESG (environmental, social, and governance) score and with its three sub-dimensions between 2011 and 2018. Fixed Effects regression analysis was run to test the hypotheses, and subsequently, Ordinary Least Squares regression was run to test the robustness of the results. The results suggest that board gender diversity is positively associated with overall corporate social responsibility performance and governance performance. Moreover, the firms which have a sustainability committee are more likely to have greater corporate social responsibility performance (both overall and social) than those do not. Furthermore, firms with diffused ownership structures are more likely to show greater performance in the Social Pillar of corporate social responsibility. Board independence has a weak association with only governance performance. Contrary to expectations, the results regarding the value-relevance of corporate social responsibility performance did not produce significant positive outcomes. These findings confirm that women on boards and corporate social responsibility committees are an essential factor to achieve corporate social responsibility goals. However, the insignificant relationship between board characteristics and the Environmental Pillar of corporate social responsibility performance is quite surprising, and the discovery sparks various queries. Finally, logistics firms need to reconsider the competency or role of independent directors in corporate social responsibility issues as currently they are weakly influential. © 2020","Board characteristics; Corporate social responsibility; Drivers; Firm value; Logistics sector","Regression analysis; Board characteristics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Gender diversity; Independent directors; Logistics firm; Ordinary least squares regressions; Ownership structure; Value relevances; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086889101

In doing so, I argue that neo-normative control has progressive and ‘alternative’ potential if practiced alongside procedures that (1) prevent autonomy from turning into isolation and marginalization, (2) ensure that solidarity does not morph into an unquestioned hegemony of the strong, and (3) enable responsibility to the future to be carried out in an accountable manner.

Recent statistical learning approaches exploit spatiotemporal dependence patterns among neighbouring sites, but their requirement of sharing confidential data with third parties may limit their use in practice. This explains the recent interest in distributed, privacy preserving algorithms for high-dimensional statistical learning, e.g. with auto-regressive models. The few approaches that have been proposed are based on batch learning. However, these approaches are potentially computationally expensive and do not allow for the accommodation of nonstationary characteristics of stochastic processes like wind power generation. This paper closes the gap between online and distributed optimisation by presenting two novel approaches that recursively update model parameters while limiting information exchange between wind farm operators and other potential data providers. A simulation study compared the convergence and tracking ability of both approaches. In addition, a case study using a large dataset from 311 wind farms in Denmark confirmed that online distributed approaches generally outperform existing batch approaches while preserving privacy such that agents do not have to actively share their private data. © 2020 International Institute of Forecasters","Distributed optimisation; Energy forecasting; Multivariate time series; Online learning; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086710276

Our findings show that public service professionals—just like ordinary citizens—are susceptible to framing effects. Specifically, they tend to evaluate federal agency performance more negatively when percentages of “job dissatisfaction” and “targets not met” were presented, as opposed to logically equivalent percentages of “job satisfaction” and “targets met.” The pattern is the same for “customer dissatisfaction” versus “customer satisfaction” rates, although the results are not statistically significant.

Data is based on a questionnaire-survey among 190 manufacturers about their readiness for digitalized manufacturing and their actual practice in this area. A main finding is that it is the managers’ lack of perceiving Industry 4.0 drivers, not their perceptions of high Industry 4.0 barriers that obstruct SMEs’ development of Industry 4.0 readiness and their application of Industry 4.0 technologies.

Methods: 32 men and women aged 60–83 from recreational football teams performed a 5-min W, followed by 10-min WF and RF games in a counterbalanced order, separated by an 8–10 min break. The men and women played 5v5 and 6v6, respectively, on small-sided football pitches (men: 40 × 16.5 m; women 40 × 30 m) with medium-sized goals (3 × 1.5 m). Heart rate (HR) and locomotor activities were monitored throughout sessions and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) scores were determined immediately after sessions. Results: During RF, mean HR was higher (P 0.05) compared to WF and W for both men aged 60+ (126 ± 23 vs 112 ± 19 and 98 ± 19 beats/min) and women aged 60+ (144 ± 24 vs 133 ± 30 and 112 ± 20 beats/min), and higher (P < 0.05) during WF than W. During RF, more distance (P < 0.05) was covered at >8 km/h compared to WF and W for both men aged 60+ (134 ± 73 vs 36 ± 27 and 6 ± 7 m) and women aged 60+ (119 ± 89 vs 39 ± 38 and 1 ± 1 m), with more distance (p < 0.05) during WF compared to W. Both men and women had higher PACES and RPE scores (P < 0.05) for RF compared to WF. Conclusion: WF for elderly men and women results in higher heart rates and more distance covered in more intense speed zones than W, but less than in traditional small-sided football. Future studies should elucidate the hypothesis that WF is more effective in relation to fitness and health benefits compared to W, but less effective compared to small-sided traditional football. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Football; health; older adults; soccer; walking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084817471

These textile elements can, in this way, be individual in both geometry, detailing and material behaviour. This work extends recent work on CNC knitted tensile members and presents a set of innovations in design and manufacturing, which together allow to build structural systems, in which highly individualised membrane members allow a structure to take on multiple structural states. Underlying these innovations is a shift from the focus on geometry and homogeneity in material and behaviour, expressed in current state-of-the-art membrane structures and materials. Instead our research lays the foundation for a new class of membrane materials with varying bespoke local material properties. In this paper we present the underlying digital tools and processes for design, analysis and manufacturing of these hyper specified textile membranes.

A two-stage stochastic programming model is developed to find an effective design strategy under stochastic and highly seasonal biomass supply. The biomass usage, as a renewable energy source, for the power generation affects the environment and society in multiple ways, such as social expectations, life-threatening issues, and greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence, in the stochastic model, by the social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) approach, the SC’s social impact is guaranteed to be larger than a minimum acceptable rate. Furthermore, the environmental risk of the SC is quantified based on its air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions and mitigated. To deal with the biomass supply uncertainty, discrete scenarios are generated using a backward scenario reduction approach. Computational results are presented on a real-life case study in Iran to show the stochastic model’s applicability in evaluating the economic potential, the sustainability aspects, and the required infrastructure for the planning of the SC system. In addition, to drive managerial insights, sensitivity analysis on key parameters of the optimisation problem is done. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Biomass; Environmental risk; Power generation; Stochastic programming; Supply Chain planning; Sustainable development","Biomass; Ecodesign; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Computational results; Environmental risks; Optimisation problems; Renewable energy source; Scenario reductions; Sustainable supply chains; Two-stage stochastic programming; Various technologies; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083796929

University students (n = 94) completed an online baseline survey, after which they were randomly assigned to a terrorism or non-terrorism media exposure condition. Approximately 1–2 weeks later, participants attended an experimental session in which they were shown a real life news clip about a recent terrorist event (terrorism media exposure) or a non-violent societal risk (non-terrorism media exposure). Participants filled out a brief online survey immediately before and after the intervention. Socio-demographic factors and perceived life stress were assessed at baseline. Perceived susceptibility to terrorism, terrorism-related worry, and support for security measures were measured at pre- and post-intervention. Data were analyzed using a series of two-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) controlling for pretest scores and relevant socio-demographic factors. Significant interaction effects were found between media exposure and perceived life stress on support for the following security measures: video surveillance, mandatory bag checks at universities, and security patrols at universities during the day. More specifically, participants with lower levels of stress scored similarly on these measures in the terrorism and non-terrorism media exposure groups, whereas among those with higher stress levels, scores were significantly greater in the terrorism compared to non-terrorism media exposure group. Thus, young adults with elevated levels of perceived life stress were more responsive to media coverage of terrorism compared to those with lesser life stress when it comes to a desire for regulatory action. This indicates that higher levels of general life stress may sensitize young people towards the impact of threatening information. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","demand for security measures; media; Perceived life stress; risk perception; terrorism","Behavioral research; Population statistics; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Security systems; Surveys; Emotional reactions; Exposure conditions; Interactive effect; Perceived susceptibility; Socio-demographic factors; Support for securities; University students; Video surveillance; Terrorism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083593800

The traditional character of a relationship between the academic researcher and the “researched” is one where researchers dictate the terms of the research, i.e. they choose what topics to consider and to try to get funding for, the modes of investigating, and ways findings are gathered, interpreted and communicated. Extending a recently-published book of readings about doing research WITH managers (Freytag & Young, 2018), the work of a number of the contributors is used as a basis for an argument that increased value is created and greater relevance is achieved by deeper forms of reciprocal research collaboration with business and government practitioners. The foundations of this kind of win-win research collaboration include epistemological compatibility, solid theoretical grounding, relevant research practices and systematic co-evaluation that are geared to specific collaborative settings. The resulting research can better advance not only practice-related knowledge but also the theoretical and empirical knowledge of business academia. This is illustrated with examples of several projects and programmes where research is effectively co-produced and benefits accrue to all. © 2020","Business; Collaboration; Knowledge co-production; Research design; Research relevance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082421871

The evidence is mixed but generally suggests that when a nation's athletes win medals at international tournaments–for example the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup–it cannot be expected to inspire amateurs to take up sport themselves. So far, existing research has primarily focused on international elite success. Effects from local elite clubs playing in national leagues have only been examined once. Research methods: Since recent research indicates that national and cultural contexts can influence whether a potential trickle-down effect materialises, this paper aims to test these factors in another setting. By deploying panel data regression models on data from Danish top-tier professional soccer, we test whether local club performance affects local membership levels in Denmark. Results and Findings: We do not find direct positive effects from sporting success. However, we do identify negative effects on membership figures due to club relegation indicating that sporting failure can affect mass participation. Implications: A key recommendation drawn from this study is that politicians, sport managers and civil servants should be careful using the double pyramid/‘virtuous circle of sport’ metaphor as the basis of their decision-making because it is an imprecise theoretical interpretation of reality. Instead, stakeholders should focus effort and resources on other relevant factors that potentially can lead to higher–or even lower–levels of participation in order to stimulate such factors (or prevent those that affects negatively). Future studies should examine these implications further. © 2020 European Association for Sport Management.","club level sporting success; Denmark; mass participation; professional soccer; Trickle-down effects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081594234

Why and how these firms use global innovation networks remains however poorly understood. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with firm representatives and network data collected through a survey of video game developers in southern Sweden. Video game development is a typical example of a symbolic industry, encompassing the development of non-tangible and symbol-intensive products and services. In recent years, this industry has advanced from a niche sector into a global mass market. Understanding how the hybrid character of the industry–with strong symbolic cultural roots but also a significant global engagement–affects the geography of innovation networks is the focus of this paper. The analysis reveals that knowledge sourcing and exchange take place likewise on the regional and global scale, but for different purposes and through different mechanisms. It also shows that not all variance in network engagement can be explained by differences in industrial knowledge bases or regional innovation systems. In contrast, the target market and the nature and geography of demand are important explanatory factors. © 2020 The Author(s).

The last decade has seen an increase in empirical research associated with dual careers in sport, with a particular focus on understanding and developing individual characteristics which are important to ensure success in sports and education or a vocation. More recent work has, however, also identified the importance of environmental factors in ensuring successful dual career outcomes. The aims of this study, therefore, are to: (a) identify and classify the different types of dual career development environments (DCDEs) and (b) provide outlines of the key features of the environments identified. Research methods. To achieve these aims, this study adopted the procedure of initial documentary analysis, interviews with knowledgeable stakeholders, cross-case analysis, and researcher discussions across seven countries in Europe (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). Results and findings. Results highlighted that there are eight types of DCDEs – (a) sports-friendly schools, (b) elite sport schools/colleges, (c) professional and/or private club programs, (d) sport-friendly universities, (e) combined dual career systems, (f) national sports programs, (g) defense force programs and (h) players’ union programs with a range of approaches to supporting dual careers. Implications. The research has practical implications in the context of dual career, through providing a possible framework for developing national taxonomies and, therefore, identifying DCDE characteristics and gaps in dual career support. © 2020 European Association for Sport Management.","dual careers of athletes; ecological approach; elite sport; support system; talent development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079749527

This paper offers three main contributions: First, convergence and divergence of institutional logics by industry, government, and academic actors can lead to alignment and misalignment at three levels: actor-type, relationship, and system levels. Second, partial alignment and misalignment are found to be in-between modes of alignment, which challenges the idea that alignment and misalignment are dichotomous. Instead, alignment and misalignment should be seen as the two ends of a continuum. Third, alignment and misalignment are dynamic by nature, because institutional logics change and modify during collaboration.

Moving the heavy racks takes a considerable amount of time and, consequently, it strongly affects the total pick time. We formalise the resulting operational picker-routing problem, which aims at routing the picker such that as few aisles as possible need to be accessed and the total distance covered is minimal. Moreover, we address the interdependent tactical product-location problem, which deals with deciding on the storage locations of the items to be picked.

Additionally, online customer communities (OCCs) have become increasingly popular and have proven to provide substantial value to both customers and enterprises. Therefore, the focus of this paper is to (1) propose a mathematical online community-based dynamic customisation model, (2) explain its practical mechanism and (3) solve its dynamic trade-off challenge. Accordingly, first, the trade-off challenge was formulated according to a multi-objective optimisation model to optimise the trade-off between customer satisfaction and enterprise profit. Second, based on the mechanism of the model, three different matching modes of production between customised products and manufacturers were delineated and analysed. Finally, genetic algorithm (GA) was developed to solve the proposed mathematical model. To validate the proposed model, a case study of an enterprise that provides customised menswear was selected. The degree of customisation and the weights given to the functions of enterprise profit and customer satisfaction were further analysed. The proposed model assists researchers and practitioners to decide the cooperation mode with manufacturers, pricing strategy and the degree of customisation for an optimal trade-off in the context of online community-based dynamic customisation. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dynamic trade-off; genetic algorithm (GA); mass customisation (MC); multi-objective optimisation; online customer community (OCC)","Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Online systems; Profitability; Sales; Social networking (online); Conversion rates; Customisation; Mass customisation; Multi objective; On-line communities; Online customers; Pricing strategy; Trade off; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075714185

This development indicates that many Danes are now customers of commercial sport for all fitness programmes. In response to this, the non-profit sector in Denmark has started its own fitness activities, giving rise to debates about fair competition. In this paper, we aim to identify the determinants for the provision of for-profit fitness and potential substitution effects between non-profit and for-profit providers of sport for all leisure activities. By deploying regression modelling on cross-sectional data, we find that the presence of non-profit fitness centres does not seem to affect the provision of commercial ones.

First, we enrich the conceptual vocabulary for the study of transparency as a dynamic multiplicity with varying power effects in different contexts, challenging in this way universalizing and otherwise reductive notions of transparency. Second, by emphasizing the operation of several coexisting matrices we provide a novel way of approaching the ‘post panoptic’ condition which can account not only for the power effects of different modalities of transparency, but also for the instabilities and potential openings that are generated by their interplay.

Using a sample of 110 interviews with business leaders from a recently developed oral history database, the study shows that more than three-quarters of such leaders invested in education as a non-profit activity. The article explores three different types of motivations behind such high levels of engagement with education: values driven, context focussed, and firm focussed. The article identifies significant regional variations in terms of investment execution, structure, and impact. In South and Southeast Asia, there was a preference for long-term investment in primary and secondary education. In Africa and Latin America, some initiatives sometimes had a shorter-term connotation, but with high-profile projects in partnerships with international organisations and foreign universities. In Turkey, there was heavy focus on training and the creation of universities. The article concludes by examining the impact of this investment, comparing Chile and India especially. It discusses issues such as the paucity of financial data and the challenges of comparing different types of educational spending, which make robust conclusions hard, but does suggest that although such spending did not resolve major educational roadblocks across the emerging world, it represented a positive overall social gain. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Business history; CSR; economic history; education; emerging markets; oral history; philanthropy; reputation","business development; corporate social responsibility; economic history; education; investment; market development; Africa; Chile; India; Latin America; Southeast Asia; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074581252

While the universities still fulfill these missions, a third mission has been added: university research must establish its direct value to society. However, a lingering question is how this third mission should be carried out. While the earliest models focused on the universities operating similarly to an R&D department in a private company – seeking to patent research inventions and then capitalising on intellectual property rights – the focus today is much more nuanced and incorporates both invention- and innovation-oriented activities. This article captures existing knowledge of universities’ third mission activities and identifies five different models of how universities seek to fulfil the third mission. These models are empirically investigated through two multi-level case studies based on insights from universities’ top management, innovation and/or technology transfer offices, and research units within the emerging drone technology area. The findings illustrate how the two universities seek to fulfil the third mission, based on the same starting point but following different models. Moreover, a sixth model is identified, namely the Ecosystem Model, where the universities engage more extensively and with greater responsibility in collaborative efforts with a range of public and private actors on addressing comprehensive industrial and societal challenges through technology development and market insights. In doing so, the university’s role becomes more active in advancing the development of an industry. This emerging way of fulfilling the third mission is discussed with respect to university management and the achievement of societal goals. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Drones; ecosystem; research; scientific discovery; sustainable development goals; technology transfer; third mission; universities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074423035

Based on case study evidence of a school that has signed the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME), we found poor alignment between the school’s explicit RME claims and students’ lived experiences. While the formal curriculum signaled to students that RME was important, the school’s hidden curriculum sent a number of tacit messages that led students to question the relevance and applicability of responsible management. The tacit messages that students received occurred along three “message sites” related to (a) how the formal curriculum was delivered, (b) how students and lecturers interacted, and (c) how the school was governed. On the basis of these findings we develop a proposition that can guide further research in this area, i.e., the connotative level of language use is an important site of misalignments between what lecturers say in relation to RME (e.g., in a syllabus) and how students interpret the meaning of their lecturers’ words. We also discuss further implications of our findings for strengthening the alignment between schools’ formal RME claims and their hidden curriculum. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Business education; Classroom practices; Hidden curriculum; PRME; Responsible management education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067295973

We also explore the role that position and organizational tenure play in shaping that commitment, since tenure length is often associated with greater commitment, and assumed to be an important mediator of employee and organizational outcomes. Multi-level analyses of a large multinational survey of senior managers from the central governments of 16 European countries indicate that a greater proportion of private relative to public sector work experience is associated with weaker organizational commitment among senior public managers. In addition, position and organizational tenure are both positively related to commitment. Mediation analysis suggests that the mechanism through which the negative effect of private sector experience on senior managers’ organizational commitment operates is individuals’ shorter tenure in the same organization. All of these results hold when we analyze the affective, continuance, and normative dimensions of commitment separately. © Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063593998

School leaders are regarded as important actors in the implementation of reforms, which are occurring at an increasing pace. Furthermore, they are regarded as professionals who can make judgments on behalf of their pupils, teachers, and schools. However, becoming a school leader is an underexposed process that typically involves a departure from one’s previous professional identity as a teacher. In this article, we study this process by analysing qualitative interviews that were conducted with three school leaders in the Danish primary public school (Folkeskole): a young member, a middle-aged member, and a senior member. Our point of departure is Bourdieu’s theory of habitus, as well as narrative theory. We find that all school leaders construct professional identities in continuation of their teacher identities but that these differ along the lines of what we refer to as professional leaders and leaders of the profession. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063525505

However, as the complexity of renovation projects is high, multi-criteria decision-making methods can support the decision makers throughout the renovation process. This study explores two value-based decision-making methods: the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and weighting, rating and calculating (WRC), in how they support decision makers in weighting criteria in the pre-design stage of building renovation projects. Participants from a Danish municipality were given the task of applying AHP and WRC to prioritize a set of renovation criteria. Four themes were analyzed: (1) practical applicability and decision transparency, (2) reflection and learning, (3) satisfaction with the final decision and (4) comparison to the original decision process. The results indicate that applying a formal weighting method in the pre-design stage of renovation projects increases the reflection, learning, transparency and satisfaction with the group decision outcome among the participants. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","AHP; decision support; Multi-criteria decision making word; WRC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062450954

In the last few years, the investment in impact investing has grown many folds, however the research has not kept pace with the growing practitioner interest. The lack of knowledge about the field coupled with the lack of knowledge production of field might be dangerous in the long run. This is a systematic review of impact investing. This systematic review involves study of 85 published articles and reports. This literature was collected using the harzing’s publish or perish academic search engine and cross-checked against databases such as JSTOR and Web of Science. This review has four major contributions. First, the study reveals a unique longitudinal perspective on how the field is evolving and moving from pre-paradigm stage to the stage of proper scientific inquiry. It reveals that the field is evolving, as the reviewed literatures find that a higher number of empirical works were published recently. Second, the field impact investing is unique on six characteristics namely (1) capital invested, (2) degree of engagement with the investee, (3) process of selection, (4) social and commercial outcomes, (5) reporting outcomes, and (6) government role. Third, it reveals that the scholarship in the field has been mostly exploratory. Only recently the field is engaging in confirmatory studies. The research methods have used existing databases or existing single or multiple case studies. Finally, the field has to delve deeper into concepts like selection process, stakeholder management, opportunity recognition, and performance reporting to move the field forward and generate applied knowledge. © 2019 Journal of the Canadian Council for Small Business and Entrepreneurship/Conseil Canadien de la PME et de l’entrepreneuriat.","impact investing; research agenda; social entrepreneurship; social finance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060945654

It finds that internment impacted business relationships in India well beyond its endpoint and that the First World War internment shaped the subsequent perception of and strategic response to the Second World War experience. It is shown that internment aggravated existing staffing challenges, impacted on the perception of racial lines of distinctions and re-cast the category ‘European business’.

The claims for the relationship between PSM and volunteering have rarely been supported by evidence based on direct measurements of PSM. Using data from a large representative sample of public and semi-public sector employees in the Netherlands, we show that CPI is positively related to volunteering. This relationship is stronger for participation in some volunteering domains than in others. We suggest that public-interest-committed employees seek out volunteering opportunities that match their motivation and that the extent to which voluntary organizations espouse public service ideals may explain the differential strength of the relationship between employees’ CPI and their participation in different volunteering domains. This finding is relevant for voluntary and nonprofit organizations which need to attract volunteers to keep up welfare services. © Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2018 Peter L. M.
