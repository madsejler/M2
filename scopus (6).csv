We report the results of three tests of independence of mind and one test of independence in appearance. These tests find that there is a positive relationship between audit fees and non-audit fees, which does not suggest loss of independence. Further analysis using two-stage least squares shows that audit and non-audit fees are jointly determined, and the results are still not consistent with loss of independence. There is no relationship between the provision of non-audit services and the frequency with which auditors issue modified audit opinions. There is no association between non-audit services and audit tenure. Finally, we examine the relationship between unexpected or excess non-audit fees and cost of capital. There is no relationship. Our findings fail to find any evidence for loss of independence of mind or loss of independence of appearance as a result of providing non-audit services. © 2016 The Author(s).

This chapter examines the processes that lead to new products and services in a tourism context. It does so based on two commonly referred to modes of innovation (Jensen et al., 2007); that is, two types of innovation processes: science, technology, and innovation (STI) and doing, using, and interacting (DUI). DUI appears to capture the essence of innovation in tourism enterprises better than STI because it acknowledges the intrinsic nature of services and the typical size and working modes of touristic actors. The case study of Icehotel illustrates how working in partnerships and in close cooperation with customers enhances the advantages of the DUI model. The handling of externally induced events and difficulties and the critical partnerships are better understood through the DUI than through the STI lens. The DUI framework leads to a more correct picture of tourism innovation and could also provide a better guidance for policy processes in the field. © 2017, IGI Global.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016545065

What is lacking, is research that would synthesize key findings and “lessons learned” across a variety of cases. In this study, we explore ten cases of green economy of different sectors and approaches from five European countries and identify factors that have had critical importance for the success or failure of the cases. Our paper reveals similarities across small and large scale cases and different approaches for implementing green economy. We identified critical factors related to economic viability, public funding, technological development, impact assessments, public policies and regulation, social capital, leadership and coordination as well as public acceptability and image. According to our results, transition to green economies requires negotiation between potential trade-offs among multiple goals, and interests of various stakeholders. The mutual benefits can be communicated through valid impact assessments and the integration of R&D into the practical implementation. Securing the continuity of funding and leadership is crucial in successful experiments and attention should be paid to fostering social capital among stakeholders. Instead of any single critical factor, the practical implementation of green economy is related to a multiplicity of factors and causalities depending on the context. The challenges with the practical implementation of green economy can only be met with patient, careful and far-sighted planning of green economy initiatives as well as continuous learning from past experiences. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioeconomy; Case studies; Circular economy; Critical factors; Green economy; Practical implementation","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Bioeconomy; Case-studies; Circular economy; Critical factors; Green economies; Practical implementation; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995674838

However, since substantial uncertainty is involved in early-stage design analyses, the ranking and identification of potential sustainable solutions is a challenging task. This work aims at facilitating the environmental sustainability assessment under uncertainty at the conceptual design of bioprocesses. This, in turn, enables screening design alternatives, and establishing a ranking of the most promising pathways. To this end, a step-wise methodology has been proposed to assist decision-makers to: (i) collect and generate the input data for bioprocesses; (ii) systematically reduce uncertainty concerning the material fluxes at the early stage design of bioprocesses, reducing overall uncertainty in the life cycle inventory; (iii) handle parameter uncertainty, by applying the Monte Carlo technique for the propagation of uncertainty in characterization factors to the potential impact categories' outcomes; (iv) establish sound quantitative thresholds for alternatives comparison by incorporating a probabilistic interpretation; and lastly, (v) rank the alternatives within the design space. Finally, the methodology's applicability is highlighted by screening early-stage glycerol bioconversion routes to value-added chemicals for future biorefinery concepts. Through the proposed methodology, it was demonstrated that the statistical approach suggested ensures consistent and robust ranking of alternatives; thereby identifying lactic acid as the best potential environmentally sustainable alternative within the design space. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioprocesses; Characterization factors (CFs); Early stage design; Glycerol biorefinery; Life cycle environmental assessment; Uncertainty analysis","Bioconversion; Climate change; Conceptual design; Decision making; Energy security; Glycerol; Lactic acid; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Refining; Sustainable development; Bioprocesses; Biorefineries; Characterization factors; Early stage designs; Environmental assessment; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995654946

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Impacts on the environment from human activities are now threatening to exceed thresholds for central Earth System processes, potentially moving the Earth System out of the Holocene state. To avoid such consequences, the concept of Planetary Boundaries was defined in 2009, and updated in 2015, for a number of processes which are essential for maintaining the Earth System in its present state. Life-Cycle Assessment was identified as a suitable tool for linking human activities to the Planetary Boundaries. However, to facilitate proper use of Life-Cycle Assessment for non-global environmental management based on the Planetary Boundaries, there is a need for linking non-global activities to impacts on a planetary level. In this study, challenges related to development and operationalization of a Planetary Boundary based Life-Cycle Impact Assessment method are identified and the feasibility of resolving the challenges and developing such methodology is discussed. The challenges are related to technical issues, i.e., modelling and including the Earth System processes and their control variables as impact categories in Life-Cycle Impact Assessment and to theoretical considerations with respect to the interpretation and use of Life-Cycle Assessment results in accordance with the Planetary Boundary framework. The identified challenges require additional research before a Planetary Boundaries based Life-Cycle Impact Assessment method can be developed. Research on modelling the impacts on Earth System processes and on allocation of and entitlement to the ‘safe operating space’ appear to be most urgent for operationalizing a Planetary Boundaries based Life-Cycle Impact Assessment method. The results of a Planetary Boundaries based Life-Cycle Impact Assessment would be highly relevant and could provide novel insights on the environmental performance and sustainability of products and systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Absolute sustainability; Life-Cycle Assessment; Sustainability","Earth (planet); Environmental management; Sustainable development; Control variable; Earth systems; Environmental performance; Holocenes; Human activities; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995596126

However, green economy covers a lot of diverse concepts and its links with sustainability are not always clear. In this article, we focus on definitions of green economy and related concepts and an evaluation of these concepts against the criterion of strong and weak sustainability. The article serves three purposes: Firstly, we identify and describe diverse theories, concepts, approaches and tools related to a “green economy”. Among these are the theories of environmental economics and ecological economics, the concepts and approaches of cleaner production, waste hierarchy, bio-economy, industrial ecology, circular economy, nature-based solutions, and dematerialization through product-servicizing, and tools like life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, we develop a framework that shows the capacity of the green economy concepts, approaches and tools to support the transition towards sustainability. Such a framework can serve as a heuristic to embed diverse concepts and approaches into a green economy framework. Thirdly, we briefly discuss green economy concepts with respect to their impact on strong and weak sustainability. Depending on the different concepts, approaches and tools identified in the green economy framework, different degrees of substitutability and trade-offs between environmental and economic benefits are allowed, and more or less structural changes of our modes of living are required. By discussing the notion of green economy and related concepts, approaches and tools we seek to make a contribution to their definitions and relationships as a prerequisite for operationalizing green economy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological economics; Environmental economics; Green economy (GE); Substitutability; Sustainability; Trade-offs","Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Life cycle; Pollution control; Sustainable development; Ecological economics; Environmental economics; Green economies; Substitutability; Trade off; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995579572

This requires a comprehensive transition of the energy system. For some decades, district heating in Denmark has been contributing to high fuel efficiency as well as to the integration of the electricity and heating sectors. Large-scale compression heat pumps would improve the integration between the district heating and power sectors by utilising the fluctuations in the supply from wind power, solar photo voltaic and other sources. Previous studies indicate that the introduction of heat pumps in Denmark will have a positive impact on the total costs for energy supply in the transition towards 100% renewable energy. In this paper, this is further investigated to assess the feasibility of heat pumps in the Danish energy system. The assessment is made by applying two different energy system analysis tools, named EnergyPLAN and MODEST. The comparison and discussion of these tools is a secondary purpose of the study. In general, the results show a potential for introducing heat pumps in Denmark between 2 and 4 GW-thermal power and a total potential benefit around 100 M€/year in 2025. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","combined heat and power (CHP); District heating; Energy sector integration; Energy system analysis; Heat pump; Renewable energy","District heating; Energy policy; Energy resources; Heating; Integration; Pumps; Systems analysis; Wind power; Combined heat and power; Energy sector; Energy system analysis; Heat pumps; Renewable energies; Heat pump systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995579543

The potential benefits derived from ecodesign are constantly highlighted in the literature, and go beyond the pure environmental dimension. However, the primary focus has been positioned on evaluating those benefits in terms of product-related environmental performance, which leaves an open potential for capturing performance from a broader managerial perspective. Consequently, the major challenges tackled by this paper relate to the limited focus on process-oriented perspectives that cover all dimensions of the triple bottom line and offer a systematized view on ecodesign performance measurement. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive set of process-related key performance indicators for product development, based on a three-step systematic literature review, followed by systematization of indicators and a critical analysis. A total of 787 indicators were identified and classified according to the sustainability dimensions, product development phases and units of measurement. The results point to a relevant asymmetry in the number of indicators proposed for each sustainability dimension, with large dominance of economic indicators. A critical analysis is presented and discussed in terms of the main organizational functions addressed, emphasizing a potential growth trend towards multi-dimensional indicators in recent years. The paper indicates that product development performance is still being mainly discussed in terms of product physical characteristics, along with a broad assortment of topics - from very specific document-related measures to high-level strategic dimensions - without focusing on environmental aspects, which is mainly due to the intangible and uncertain nature of product development processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecodesign implementation; Ecodesign management; Performance indicators; Product development; Sustainability performance","Benchmarking; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Product development; Units of measurement; Environmental performance; Performance indicators; Product development performance; Product development phasis; Product development process; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainability performance; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995376711

The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of vermicomposting to reduce nitrogen losses and greenhouse gases emissions compared to thermophilic composting, and (ii) to determine the effect of different variables (i.e. carbon:nitrogen ratio, earthworm density, moisture content and carbon quality) on greenhouse gases emissions and earthworm growth during vermicomposting. The results showed that vermicomposting significantly reduced nitrogen loss by 10–20% compared to thermophilic composting. Vermicomposting decreased nitrous oxide emissions by 25–36% and methane emissions by 22–26%. A higher earthworm density increased carbon dioxide emissions by 3–14%, but decreased methane emissions by 10–35%. Earthworm density had a marginal effect on nitrous oxide emissions. Vermicomposting decreased nitrous oxide emissions by 40% with higher moisture and by 23% with lower moisture. Vermicomposting also decreased methane emissions by 32% and 16% with higher and lower moistures respectively. This study showed that the addition of labile carbon sources increased carbon dioxide and methane emissions and earthworm growth, but did not affect nitrous oxide emissions. In conclusion, vermicomposting is effective at reducing nitrogen losses and greenhouse gas emissions from composting. Therefore, vermicomposting could represent an option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from composting, particularly in developing countries where the existing technical solutions are expensive and difficult to implement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Earthworms; Substrate quality; Thermophilic composting; Vermicomposting","Carbon dioxide; Density of gases; Developing countries; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Moisture; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Carbon dioxide emissions; Earthworms; Greenhouse gases emissions; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Substrate quality; Technical solutions; Vermi-composting; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989321277

Today, the so-called super majors, largely the reconstituted Seven Sisters and CFP, produced less than 12 percent of the total. Thus while an analysis of the world of oil in 1970 could focus on the Seven Sisters as essentially constituting the ‘world of oil,’ an analysis of the super majors today, the primary focus of this volume, while perhaps less complete, is not less important. The changing role of the super major “stars” in our analysis, together with their ‘planets,’ the major ‘Independents,’ explains how much things have changed in the past thirty-five years. This involves a somewhat different focus than currently is prevalent, a focus on the Brent and WTI futures markets, on OPEC quotas, and arbitrary producer government behaviour.

Further, to investigate the role of implementation intensity on the outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal, participatory intervention study of 62 preschools involving approximately 1,800 employees. The evaluation uses short-term sickness absence to measure employee health, employee-assessed primary-task quality and parent-assessed user satisfaction to measure organizational effectiveness, and implementation intensity was measured as hours per employee and as per the request by the workplace managers, and compensation was offered by the project. Findings: The multi-level analyses show that preschools with higher implementation intensity have stronger effects on employee health and organizational effectiveness than preschools with lower implementation intensity. The differences indicate that the main intervention component, improving performance of the central work tasks through collaborative, participatory workplace activities, had effects on both health and effectiveness and that workplace and employee engagement in the intervention is crucial to its success. Practical implications: Inspired by the Tavistock tradition for socio-technical systems design, the study indicates an avenue for conducting collaborative organizational change processes that benefit both employees and organizations. In addition, it proposes “hours used per employee” as a relatively simple measure of implementation intensity in such interventions. Originality/value: The study contributes to research in the field of occupational psychological health by reporting on a comprehensive participatory intervention study comprising measures of employee health, organizational performance and implementation intensity. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Intervention study; Organisation effectiveness; Organisation health and well-being; Primary-task quality; Sickness absence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051284370

Leaders must utilize their experience, intuition and insights to ask the right questions – not all the possible questions which big data can address. Is there a synthesis?

This notion is accepted virtually worldwide, but the more precise content of the ""presentation rule"" differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, and of importance, the legal basis establishing the ""presentation rule"" differs. With the technological advances in maritime transport as well as in communications technology and the emergence of more complicated trading patterns, a system where a specific tangible piece of paper issued at the port of loading has to be presented at the port of discharge to obtain delivery of the goods seems almost archaic and can obviously create problems. Thus, in practice very often - especially in some trades such as the oil trade - the bill of lading is not available at the port of discharge when the ship is ready to deliver the cargo. The book will first analyse the ""presentation rule"", its finer contents and its legal basis. It will then go on with (legal) analyses of three developments and responses to the problems that the bill of lading system gives rise to in practice, viz. the commercial, the international legislature's, and the technological response. The commercial response analysed here consists of contractual exemption or limitation clauses in the bill of lading set up as a defence against claims for misdelivery. The international legislature's response denotes the adoption of the Rotterdam Rules which as the first international convention on carriage of goods by sea includes elaborate rules on delivery of the goods. Finally, the technological response denotes the possibility of using electronic (equivalents of) bills of lading.

We analyze a stark model where the pollutant is generated by production of a good that is exported from the polluting country to an importing country that is damaged by the pollutant. While the importing country can not impose an effluent tax on polluters, it can indirectly force polluters to bear some of the external costs, by imposing a tariff on the product. In this modeling context, we describe the manner in which the (second-best) tariff-cum-effluent tax relates to the stock of the pollutant. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

For internationally shared stocks, these applications have focused primarily on the need for cooperative management between fishing states to promote effective governance. Non-cooperation, however, has been the norm in shared stocks management, with the prisoner's dilemma emerging time and again, resulting in over-capacity and overfishing. In this chapter, we describe the history of global fisheries as a prisoner's dilemma, and review how cooperative Game Theory has been applied. We argue that the cooperative applications, however, are inadequate in fully elucidating how benefits from cooperation could be achieved, specifically by ignoring the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection. Both of these are related to information asymmetries and both challenge the governing authority and power of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs). Using the lens of principal-agent theory, we speculate on the potential for particular tools, such as catch shares, high seas closures, taxes and logbooks, to help strengthen RFMOs by overcoming these principal-agent problems. The case of tuna in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) is used to demonstrate the potential application of this approach. © 2017 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.

Two representative parts from the relevant part segment of the aerospace industry were selected to compare process times in different process chain configurations. For a spare part with low mechanical load requirements it was shown that a decentralized additive manufacturing process chain can reach lead times on a par with centralized stock keeping. In contrast, the lead times for a spare part with high mechanical load requirements exceed the conventional level. The proposed improvement measures are able to reduce lead times below that level, if they turn out fully effective. For a long term economic feasibility of decentralized spare part manufacturing using additive manufacturing technologies, further improvement of machine productivity as well as predictive/preventive approaches need to be in place.

RL can be used as a strategic tool to gain customer loyalty and reduce operational costs by maximizing recovery from used products. MEs face many issues which hinder successful implementation of RL such as lack of government support, financial limitations, capabilities and facilities, and market constraints. The situation is worse in case of MEs in developing countries and hence the collaboration of all its stakeholders is essential for handling the issue. Some earlier studies focused on investigating these issues and their solutions from company’s perspective without considering the role of the channel partners. To overcome this gap, this study proposes a collaborative framework for MEs which includes identifying the sustainable solutions for implementation of RL, prioritizing the solutions as per their importance and designing and optimizing a RL network based on the most important solutions identified. Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach is employed to understand the mutual relationships among the solutions and extract the most imperative solutions. The paper presents a linear programming problem for the RL network developed under a collaborative framework which aims to maximize the total sustainable impact in the planning horizon. The focus of the study is to optimally utilize the profit accrued from the returned products to generate funds for the NGO and company employees.

This article proposes a new approach to DAA that is based on detection of change points without fitting a model with a fixed number of regimes to the data, without estimating any parameters and without assuming a specific distribution of the data. It is examined whether DAA is most profitable when based on changes in the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index or change points detected in daily returns of the S&P 500 index. In an asset universe consisting of the S&P 500 index and cash, it is shown that a dynamic strategy based on detected change points significantly improves the Sharpe ratio and reduces the drawdown risk when compared with a static, fixed-weight benchmark. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Change point detection; Daily returns; Dynamic asset allocation; Non-parametric statist; Regime changes; Volatility regimes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011067324

Many governments and foundations provide substantial resources to encourage the search for solutions. Due to the significance of these problems, organizations often form partnerships in what we call search consortia to engage in joint search and compete for funding. Prior research on joint search highlights the role of specialized organizations, mainly regarding technological domains, to identify a superior solution. However, stakeholder theory leads us to believe that the success of any solution depends on the acceptance and support of important stakeholders. In this study, we suggest that search consortia are more likely to receive funding when they include representatives of stakeholder concerns, so-called advocacy groups. We extend theory on coordinated exploration in joint search by integrating mechanisms from stakeholder theory and argue that advocacy groups improve the generation of potential solutions and provide legitimacy. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 35,249 consortia that proposed solutions to 2,349 grand challenge problems as part of a large European funding program. Our results show that advocacy groups benefit search consortia, particularly when consortia exhibit a high dispersion of technological knowledge and when they are inexperienced. © Academy of Management Journal.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007390977

Here, we report and discuss the biologists’ observations on the general perception of synthetic biology by non-biologists who took part in this event. Most attendees mainly associated synthetic biology with contributions from the best-known public figures of the field, rarely mentioning other scientists. Media extrapolations of those contributions appeared to have created unrealistic expectations and irrelevant fears that were widely disconnected from the current research in synthetic biology. Another observation was that when debating developments in synthetic biology, semantics strongly mattered: depending on the terms used to present an application of synthetic biology, attendees reacted in radically different ways. For example, using the term “GMOs” (genetically modified organisms) rather than the term “genetic engineering” led to very different reactions. Stimulating debates also happened with participants having unanticipated points of view, for instance biocentrist ethicists who argued that engineered microbes should not be used for human purposes. Another communication challenge emerged from the connotations and inaccuracies surrounding the word “life”, which impaired constructive debates, thus leading to misconceptions about the abilities of scientists to engineer or even create living organisms. Finally, it appeared that synthetic biologists tend to overestimate the knowledge of non-biologists, further affecting communication. The motivation and ability of synthetic biologists to communicate their work outside their research field needs to be fostered, notably towards policymakers who need a more accurate and technical understanding of the field to make informed decisions. Interdisciplinary events gathering scholars working in and around synthetic biology are an effective tool in addressing those issues. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Emerging technologies; Interdisciplinarity; Science policy; Scientist-layperson communication; Synthetic biology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006754092

However, few workplace studies have investigated the potential negative consequences of ‘caring for’ colleagues with disabilities. Through open-ended interviews conducted in 2013 in 13 Danish work organizations with 13 employees with cerebral palsy and 62 observers, the study examines how the relational aspect of ‘care’ may result in relationships between colleagues of ‘parent–child’ or ‘helper–helpless’. The study thus clarifies the inherent contradictions embedded in the dynamics of organizational behaviour in relation to employees with disabilities, namely that workplaces may hire a person with physical limitations (perhaps to deflect accusations of social discrimination) and still end up stigmatizing these workers because of the stereotypical assumptions related to employees with disabilities. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","care; cerebral palsy; Denmark; disability; role pair; stigmatization; token; work organizations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006300297

A mainstream discourse identifies - more or less - sport with play and game and describes sport as just a modernized extension of play or as a universal phenomenon that has existed since the Stone Age or the ancient Greek Olympics. This may be problematical, as there was no sport before industrial modernity. Before 1800, people were involved in a richness of play and games, competitions, festivities, and dances, which to large extent have disappeared or were marginalized, suppressed, and replaced by sport. The established rhetoric of ""ancient Greek sport"", ""medieval tournament sport"", etc., can be questioned. Configurational analysis as a procedure of differential phenomenology can help in analyzing sport as a specific modern game which produces objectified results through bodily movement. This analysis casts light not only on the phenomenon of sport itself, but also on the methodological and epistemological challenge of studying play, movement, and body culture. © 2016 Henning Eichberg, published by De Gruyter Open.","basis and superstructure; configurational analysis; differential phenomenology; energy; historical relativity; modernity; riding; space; time",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002187732

The paper asks whether there is anything morally problematic about this practice. The aims of the paper are twofold. First, arguments based on premises of wrongful discrimination against the current, commonest use of criminal records are critically discussed. It is argued that employers do not necessarily engage in morally wrongful discrimination against job applicants when they use criminal records in recruitment screening, but it is also argued that ex-offenders who apply for jobs are subject to what can be called “structural and morally wrongful discrimination” when laws allow employers to request (or directly access) a job applicant’s full criminal record. Second, preliminary proposals on how criminal records can be used by employers in a way that avoids wrongful structural discrimination of ex-offenders will be presented and critically assessed. I suggest that it should be lawful for an employer to access an applicant’s criminal records only where there is a relevant and special match or link between the crime on the records and the job being applied for and the crime is serious. This proposal is defended against two objections, one based on concerns about crime prevention and the other based on the employer’s interest in knowing whom not to hire. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Collateral sanctions; Criminal records; Discrimination; Ethics; Ex-offenders; Job-screening; Labor market",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995972570

The early calls for microfoundations in management research argued that strategy and organization theory focused on firm-level explanations of outcomes such as competitive advantage, profit, innovation, inertia, or absorptive capacity with too little attention to the entities and mechanisms at lower levels of analysis, notably, individuals and their interactions, and how these drove firm-level outcomes. Lippman and Rumelt (2003a) provocatively argued that properly accounting for the value appropriation of all factors of production implies that there is no firm-level residual called 'profit.' Felin and Hesterly (2007) very strongly emphasize the explanatory primacy in management research of individuals. An important motivation behind the micro-foundations research agenda is arguably the desire to engage in 'reduction,' which is often seen as a hallmark of scientific inquiry. Coleman (1990: 3-4) identifies additional reasons why micro-foundations are critical. Thus, Coleman suggests that macro-level explanation cannot discriminate between the many potential alternative lower-level explanations of macro-level behaviour because of a fundamental problem of unobserved mechanisms. Based on different psychological premises, Hodgkinson and Healey (2011) argue that such approaches need to be supplemented with insight into managerial emotion and affect, and building on recent advances in social cognitive neuroscience and neuroeconomics they demonstrate how doing this leads to additional insight in dynamic capabilities.",,"Competition; Motivation; Absorptive capacity; Cognitive neurosciences; Competitive advantage; Dynamic capabilities; Factors of production; Management research; Organization theory; Scientific inquiry; Profitability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995955719

Our review of 60 studies shows that research consistently finds that top management executives exert significant influence on financial reporting decisions, particularly on disclosure quality. Empirical research has developed promising approaches to investigate executives' psychological attributes and character traits. The results of studies examining the influence of demographic characteristics of individual executives are, however, sometimes contradictory and ambiguous. Nevertheless, the overall empirical results we review are supportive of upper echelons predictions. Additional research in this field is needed to clarify the influence of unexamined upper echelon characteristics, important moderator variables, and adverse selection effects. We also suggest that future research more closely investigates the magnitudes of managerial influence and adopts a more holistic perspective on financial reporting outcomes. © 2016 University of Florida, Fisher School of Accounting","Accounting; Accounting conservatism; Chief executive officer; Chief financial officer; Earnings management; Financial reporting; Upper echelons theory; Voluntary disclosure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995477436

Our participants – 231 children, six to twelve years old – decide how many of their four colored wristbands they want to share with another anonymous child. We manipulate the visibility of this decision: in treatment Public, the decisions are revealed to the entire class at the end of the game, whereas in treatment Private children's decisions remain secret. In addition, we elicited each child's network of friends using an innovative “seating map” mechanism. Our results reveal that more popular children are more generous in Public than Private decision environments, while less popular children behave similarly in both cases. Moreover, older children in Public display greater generosity than (i) older children in Private and (ii) younger children in either Public or Private. Finally, in Public, older and more popular children share more than less popular older children, and more than younger children regardless of popularity; whereas, in Private there is no effect of popularity on children of any age. Our findings point to another reason to adopt transparent decision making in teams and organizations: it may promote the generosity of some (perhaps especially popular leaders) without detrimentally impacting the pro-sociality of others. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Children; Field experiment; Popularity; Pro-social behavior; Public decision making; Status",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992630824

Previous work demonstrates that contexts of inter-group war and peace make followers prefer dominant- and non-dominant-looking leaders, respectively. We add an intra-group perspective to this literature. Four original studies demonstrate that contexts with high risks of free-riding and criminal behavior from other group members (i.e., horizontal exploitation) increase preferences for dominant-looking leaders, whereas contexts with high risks of unresponsive, self-interested behavior from leaders themselves (i.e., vertical exploitation) decrease preferences for dominant-looking leaders. Moreover, within this framework of intra-group exploitation risks we show that followers prefer leaders from another vis-ï¿½-vis their own ethnic coalition to look less dominant, and that this difference is driven by enhanced concerns for vertical exploitation from ethnically different leaders.

We suggest a differential game model of a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a single retailer that agree on the contract parameters at the outset of the game. The model includes key operational and marketing activities related to a single product in the supply chain. The manufacturer sets a production rate and the rate of advertising efforts while the retailer chooses a purchase rate and the consumer price. The state of the game is summarized in the firms' backlogs and the manufacturer's advertising goodwill. Depending on whether the supply chain members have and share state information, they may either make decisions contingent on the current state of the game (feedback Nash strategy), or precommit to a plan of action during the whole game (open-loop Nash strategy). Given a contract type, the impact of the availability of information regarding the state of the game on the firms' decisions and payoffs is investigated. It is shown that double marginalization can be better mitigated if the supply chain members adopt a contingent strategy under a wholesale price contract and a commitment strategy under a revenue sharing contract. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","information structure; marketing; operations; revenue sharing contract; Supply chain management; wholesale price contract",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991275109

We address this gap, focusing on the learning processes during internationalization of established MNEs’ new business units, in particular their accumulation of business knowledge and internationalization knowledge and the temporal order of their knowledge acquisition. We argue that new business units benefit from the corporate environment of the parent MNE into which they are born as this may enable them to acquire business knowledge and internationalization knowledge not only by means of direct learning but also by means of indirect learning. Thus, we hypothesize that (1) internationalization speed increases with new business units’ relatedness to their parent MNEs’ portfolio of businesses, (2) new business units will increasingly rely on indirect learning to obtain business knowledge as relatedness increases, and (3) that the positive effect of direct learning of internationalization knowledge decreases the more new business units have been relying on indirect learning to obtain business and internationalization knowledge during the ramp-up process. We examine the internationalization of 788 new business units of 90 established German MNEs and find support for our arguments. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Direct learning; Indirect learning; Internationalization process; Learning sequences; New business units; Speed of internationalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988695775

The reform increased the average post-birth maternity leave by 32 days. We find some evidence that the increase in the length of paid maternity leave matters for maternal and sibling health outcomes, but only very limited evidence for the child health outcomes.

In particular, automatic stabilizers are praised since they are rule based and thus operate swiftly and symmetrically across the cycle. However, automatic stabilizers are not a result of macro design but the structure of the social safety net and the taxation system. The participation tax is a key determinant of the strength of the automatic stabilizers. Paradoxically, the disincentive effects of high participation taxes are often discussed at the same time as automatic stabilizers are praised. The paper considers the sources of automatic stabilizers and whether they (un)intentionally have been weakened via structural reforms to strengthen work incentives. It is considered whether it is possible to maintain strong automatic stabilizers without jeopardizing incentives via the design of the social safety net (workfare) or business cycle-dependent unemployment insurance. The criticism that automatic stabilizers may prolong downturns is also considered. Finally, it is discussed to what extent aggregate demand management policy can stabilize labour markets and, in particular, whether it is well targeted towards marginalized groups. Also, the potential sources of marginalization in the labour market are discussed. JEL Classification: E62; H24; H61; J60. © 2016, Andersen.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983348134

Critics have highlighted a backlash against INGOs in the Global South, a growing mismatch between INGO capacities and contemporary global challenges, and diminishing support for norms such as democracy and human rights that underpin INGOs’ work. Although these problems have attracted significant attention within the academic literature, this article argues that existing explorations of INGO legitimacy have broadly conformed either to a top-down approach focused on global norms and institutions or a bottom-up approach focused on the local dynamics surrounding states and populations in the Global South. We suggest that this divide is unhelpful for understanding the current predicament and propose a new approach, which pays closer attention to the interaction between bottom-up and top-down dimensions, and to historical context.

The Negative Acts Questionnaire-Revised was used to avoid bias related to self-labeling as being bullied. We account for important confounders, such as historical information on sickness absence and mental health, obtained through rich registry data. Our results show that gender does not significantly explain exposure to bullying and that exposure to bullying is associated with negative immediate self-reported health for both genders. We also find, however, that only bullied females have higher, persistent increases in long-term sickness absence and adverse long-term health. This suggests that men and women have different coping strategies. We investigate plausible explanations for this and find that the differences cannot be explained by, for example, turnover or lack of employment. Although insignificant, our results nonetheless indicate that men are twice as likely to leave the labor force immediately after exposure to bullying. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Absenteeism; Gender; Harassment; Health; Working environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978880937

The fuzzy front has been characterized in the literature as a very critical phase, but controversies in the FFE have not been studied before. The analysis investigates the microprocesses around the controversies that emerge during the fuzzy front end of four products. Five different types of controversies are identified: profit, production, design, brand and customers/market. Each controversy represents a threat, but also an opportunity to search for new solutions in the unpredictable non-linear processes. The study uses an ethnographic approach using qualitative data from interviews, company documents, external communication and marketing material, minutes of meetings, informal conversations and observations. The analysis of four FFE processes demonstrates how the fuzzy front requires managers to deal with controversies that emerge from many different places and involve both human and non-human actors. Closing the controversies requires managers to take account of the situation, identify the problem that needs to be addressed, and initiate a search for solutions. Management is actively involved in this process, in many different ways. Among the implications from this analysis is that the managers' role in the FFE is multifaceted and each controversy seems to require different skills and competencies. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978427591

Organizations are expected to implement appropriate practices to address knowledge-sharing challenges in GSD. With the growing literature on GSD and its widespread adoption, it is important to build a body of knowledge to support future research and effective knowledge sharing practices. Objective We aimed at systematically identifying and synthesizing knowledge sharing challenges and practices. We also intended to classify the recurrent challenges and most frequently reported practices in different contextual settings. Method We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for reviewing 61 primary studies that were selected after searching the GSD literature published over the last 14 years (2000–September 2014). We applied thematic analysis method for analysing the data extracted from the reviewed primary studies. Results Our findings revealed that knowledge sharing challenges and practices in GSD could be classified in 6 main themes: management, team structure, work processes/practices, team cognition, social attributes and technology. In regard to contextual settings, we found empirical studies were mainly conducted in an offshore outsourcing collaboration model distributed between two sites. Most of the studied organizations were large enterprises. Many of the studies did not report any information for several contextual attributes that made it difficult to analyse the reported challenges and practices with respect to their respective contexts. Conclusion We can conclude: (a) there is a higher tendency among researchers to report practices than challenges of knowledge sharing in GSD. (b) Given our analysis, most of the reported knowledge sharing challenges and practices fall under the theme of “work practices”. (c) The technology related knowledge-sharing challenges are the least reported; we discussed the available technologies for supporting knowledge sharing needs in GSD.

During the investigated period, more than 40% of the R&D units in the sample had been terminated. The results substantiate earlier research regarding the negative effects of mergers and acquisitions on R&D in acquired units but show that these effects are not immediate. They appear – if at all – with a time lag of several years. The hazard of closure for an individual unit seems to be more strongly related to its role and position within the MNE than to local country characteristics.

When operating such ships it is therefore a major challenge to decide how to best allocate cargoes to available tanks while taking into account tank capacity, safety restrictions, ship stability and strength as well as other operational constraints. The problem of finding a feasible solution to this tank allocation problem has been shown to be NP-Complete. We approach the problem on a tactical level where requirements for computation time are strict while solution quality is less important than simply finding a feasible solution. We have developed a heuristic that can efficiently find feasible cargo allocations. Computational results show that it can solve 99 % of the considered instances within 0.4 s and all of them if allowed longer time. We have also modified an optimality based method from the literature. The heuristic is much faster than this modified method on the vast majority of considered instances. However, the heuristic struggles on two instances which are relatively quickly solved by the modified optimality based method. These two methods therefore complement each other nicely and so, we have created a hybrid method that first runs the heuristic and if the heuristic fails to solve the problem, then runs the modified optimality based method on the parts of the problem that the heuristic did not solve. This hybrid method cuts between 90 and 94 % of the average running times compared to the other methods and consistently solves more instances than the other methods within any given time limit. In fact, this hybrid method is fast enough to be used in a tactical setting. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bulk shipping; Heuristic; Maritime transportation; Tank allocation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969779016

The model differs from standard valuation models in the sense that it adjusts forecasted residual income for risk in the numerator rather than through a risk-adjusted cost of equity in the denominator. The risk adjustments are derived based on assumptions about the time-series properties of residual income returns and aggregate consumption rather than on historical stock returns. We compare the performance of the model with several implementations of standard valuation models, both in terms of median absolute valuation errors (MAVE) and in terms of excess returns on simple investment strategies based on the differences between model and market prices. The CCAPM-based valuation model yields a significantly lower MAVE than the best performing standard valuation model. Both types of models can identify investment strategies with subsequent excess returns. The CCAPM-based valuation model yields time-series of realized hedge returns with more and higher positive returns and fewer and less negative returns compared with the time-series of realized hedge returns based on the best performing standard valuation model for holding periods from 1 to 5 years. In a statistical test of 1-year-ahead excess return predictability based on the models’ implied pricing errors, the CCAPM-based valuation model is selected as the better model. Using the standard series of aggregate consumption and the nominal price index, a reasonable level of relative risk aversion, and calibrated growth rates in the continuing value at each valuation date, the CCAPM-based valuation model produces small risk adjustments to forecasted residual income and low continuing values. Compared with standard valuation models, it relies less on estimated parameters and speculative elements when aggregating residual earnings forecasts into a valuation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","CAPM; CCAPM; Equity valuation; Residual income; Risk-adjusted discounting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964344792

Numerous production facilities located at various geographical locations are being utilised to address the demands of their multiple clients. Often, the components manufactured at distinct locations are being assembled in a plant to develop the final product. In this complex scenario, manufacturing firms have to be responsive enough to cope with the fluctuating demand of customers. To accomplish it, there is a need to develop an integrated, dynamic and autonomous system. In this article, a self-reactive cloud-based multi-agent architecture for distributed manufacturing system is developed. The proposed architecture will assist manufacturing industry to establish real-time information exchange between the autonomous agents, clients, suppliers and manufacturing unit. The mechanism described in this study demonstrates how the autonomous agents interact with each other to rectify the internal discrepancies in manufacturing system.

Despite the popularity of coaching as a management practice, the impact of coaching on objective measures of performance remains unclear. To this end, we tested a multilevel model linking managerial coaching frequency and skill to the sales goal attainment of 1,246 sales representatives in 136 teams within a pharmaceuticals organization over a year. Managers’ coaching skill, which was evaluated in the context of a training exercise, was directly related to the annual sales goal attainment of the sales representatives that they supervised. This effect was partially mediated by team-level role clarity, as predicted by feedback intervention theory and goal setting theory. In addition, coaching skill had a cross-level moderating effect on the relationship between coaching frequency and sales goal attainment; coaching frequency had a negative effect on goal attainment when coaching skill was low. We discuss the implications of this finding for coaching research and practice. Overall, our results demonstrate the clear theoretical and practical importance of effective managerial coaching by drawing on multisource and multilevel measurements with a predictive design. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951085739

We examine two kinds of problem/project-behaviors: Individuals can set up projects around the formulation of new problems or join existing projects and define and/or work on subproblems within an existing problem. The choice between these two behaviors is influenced by the mode of communication. A communication mode with little a priori structure is the best mode for communicating about new problems (i.e., formulating a problem); empirically, it is associated with project launching behaviors. In contrast, more structured communication fits subproblems better and is related to project joining behaviors. Our hypotheses derive support from data from the FOSS community. Managerial summary: We study how the way in which individuals communicate influence the project-behaviors they engage in. We find that relatively unstructured communication is associated with the setting up new projects, while communication that is structured around an artifact is associated with joining projects. Our findings hold implications for understanding how management may influence project behaviors and problem-solving: Firms that need to concentrate on more incremental problem-solving efforts (e.g., because a sufficient number of attractive problems have already been defined) should create environments in which interaction is undertaken mainly via artifacts. On the other hand, if firms seek to generate new problems (e.g., new strategic opportunities), they should create environments in which open-ended, verbal conversation is relatively more important than artifact-based communication.

Strategy can be formally interpreted as an idealized path optimizing heterogeneous resource deployment to produce maximum financial gain. Using standard matrix methods to describe the firm Hamiltonian, it is possible to formalize useful notions of a business model, resources, and competitive advantage. The business model that underpins strategy may be seen as a set of constraints on resources that can be interpreted as controls in optimal control theory. Strategy then might be considered to be the control variable of firm path, suggesting in turn that the firm's business model is the codification of the application of investment resources used to control the strategic path of value realization.

Southern Jutland – situated in Denmark just north of the German border, where border shops situated just south of the same border enable Danes to capitalize on the lower value added tax levels in Germany – is utilized as an illustrative case example. The data were collected by analysing the relevant tourism destination marketing material and via interviews with local destination marketing organizations and tourism firms. Based on the empirical evidence it seems that the positive impact that cross-border shopping can have on attracting large numbers of tourists into the region can outweigh the negative impact of tourists preferring border shops to local products and services: cross-border shopping has become a tourist attraction in itself, which benefits the local economies on both sides of the border. However, this potential is not taken advantage of in tourism destination marketing. The article, thus, concludes with suggestions for the tourism industry to develop its image and brand by integrating cross-border shopping into tourism destination marketing strategies.

This paper analyses innovative offshore seaweed cultivation for the production of biorefinery feedstock. The biomass is converted into three products: bioethanol, liquid fertilizer and protein-rich ingredient for fish feed. We performed comparative life cycle assessment of a base case and six alternative production scenarios in order to maximize the benefits and minimize the trade-offs in environmental performance of future macroalgal biorefineries (MABs). The results show that the base case provides a net reduction in climate change factors, i.e. −0.1·102 kg CO2 eq. per ha of sea cultivated despite a cumulative net energy demand of 3.9·104 MJ/ha, 13% of which originates from fossil sources. Regarding the environmental performance of the system, we obtained a reduction in marine eutrophication of −16.3 kg N eq./ha, thanks to bioextraction of nitrogen. For the base case the net impact on human toxicity (carcinogenic effects) was 2.1·10−4 comparative toxic units per ha of cultivation. The increase in human toxicity is seven times greater than the system can deal with, however reduction of materials for the cultivation lines, i.e. iron ballast, reduces human toxicity to 0.2·10−5 comparative toxic units. Externalities from the use of biofertilizer affect the non-carcinogenic effects of the system, resulting in 20.3·10−4 comparative toxic units per ha. Hotspots in the value chain show that biomass productivity is the main constraint against being competitive with other energy and protein producing technologies. Minor changes in plant design, i.e. use of stones instead of iron as ballast to weight the seeded lines, dramatically reduces human toxicity (cancer). Including engineered ecosystem services in the LCA significantly improves the results. As such, an increase in soil carbon stock represents 15% of the climate change mitigation provided by the MAB system. The study shows that MABs can contribute to a regenerative circular economy through environmental restoration and climate mitigation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biobased economy; Bioethanol; Life cycle assessment; Macroalgal biorefinery; Protein; Seaweed","Ballast (railroad track); Bioconversion; Bioethanol; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Environmental management; Ethanol; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Proteins; Refining; Seaweed; Toxic materials; Toxicity; Bio-based; Biorefineries; Climate change mitigation; Comparative life cycle assessment; Environmental performance; Environmental restoration; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nitrogen and phosphorus; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991507046

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","The cultivation of miscanthus (Miscanthus x Giganteus) as biomass for energy production has increased year by year due to its agronomical performances. In particular, in France, miscanthus is cultivated in the Bourgogne region and it is used as feedstock to produce pellet. In this paper, emergy assessment of different logistic (harvesting) strategies for miscanthus production in the Bourgogne region is presented. Emergy assessment is a particular methodology suited to quantify the resource use of a process and to estimate the percentage of renewability of products or services. The case study includes all phases to grow miscanthus, harvest the biomass as chips or short- or long-stranded bales and distribute it to a bioenergy plant. The aim of this study is to evaluate the sustainability performance of the whole process, from the field to the plant's gate. The emergy flow that represents the environmental cost of the whole process, the percentage of renewability (%R) and the Unit Emergy Values (UEV) that represent the resource use efficiency of the final products for each phase are calculated. Since miscanthus is reproduced by rhizomes, in addition to the system for growing and distributing miscanthus biomass, the system for producing miscanthus rhizomes is also analysed and a UEV for miscanthus rhizomes of 1.19E+05 seJ/J was obtained. Moreover, due the absence of other emergy assessments for miscanthus biomass for comparison, a sensitivity analysis has been made by considering different transport distances and different aboveground biomass yields. Comparing the harvesting methodologies, the bales made with short strands has the best performance. The aboveground biomass production was found to have an Energy Return On energy Investment (EROI), which is the double of that from an experimental miscanthus field in Italy. However, this implied a trade-off for the net energy production of about 50%. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Emergy; Energy crop; EROI; Miscanthus; Renewability; UEV","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Harvesting; Investments; Natural resources management; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Emergy; Energy crops; EROI; Miscanthus; Renewability; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991507032

Specifically, a novel mode of graphene oxide reduction through functionalization with polyphenol extracted from red wine was introduced. Comprehensive characterization methods were employed to confirm and understand the reduction process of graphene oxide in the red wine polyphenol solution. It was noted, that the deoxygenation level of the reduced graphene oxide is comparable with the levels obtained by conventional and non-ecofriendly methods. The physical and thermal properties of the generated nanofluid including chemical stability, viscosity, wettability, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity were investigated in a comprehensive manner. A significant thermal conductivity enhancement amounting to 45.1% was obtained for a volume fraction of 4%. In addition, the convective heat transfer coefficient of the nanofluid in a laminar flow regime with uniform wall heat flux was investigated to estimate its cooling capabilities.

In this study, we investigate both the product characteristics and EoL processing of robotic vacuum cleaner (RVC), as a case of emerging electronic product, in order to understand the recovery fate of different materials and its linkage to product design. Ten different brands of RVC were dismantled and their material composition and design profiles were studied. Another 125 RVCs (349 kg) were used for an experimental trial at a conventional ‘shred-and-separate’ type preprocessing plant in Denmark. A detailed material flow analysis was performed throughout the recycling chain. The results show a mismatch between product design and EoL processing, and the lack of practical implementation of ‘Design for EoL’ thinking. In the best-case scenario, only 47% of the total materials in RVCs are ultimately recycled. While this low material recovery is mainly due to the lower plastic recycling rate, other market realities and the complex material flows in the recycling chain also contribute to it. The study provides a robust methodological approach for assessing the EoL performance based on the knowledge of a product and its complex recycling chain. The lessons learned can be used to support both the design and EoL processing of products with similar features, which carry a high potential for resource recovery, especially at the initial stage of the recycling chain. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Design for end-of-life; Design for recycling; Material flow analysis; Material recovery; Robotic vacuum cleaner; WEEE","Chains; Natural resources; Recovery; Recycling; Robotics; Vacuum applications; Vacuum cleaners; Design for end of lives; Design for recycling; Material flow analysis; Material recovery; Robotic vacuum cleaners; WEEE; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990046287

Even after a consultation, the patient is not sure whether he received the right treatment or whether he was perhaps overtreated. We find that with insurance, moral hazard looms on both sides of the market: patients consult more often and physicians overtreat more often than in the baseline condition. Competition decreases overtreatment compared to the baseline and patients therefore consult more often.

Subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs), thus, have to consider both the national level and the local context when designing their business practices. To examine this impact, we study R&D outsourcing in four Eastern member states of the European Union and find that local R&D outsourcing is used more frequently where local institutions are strong. However, this local impact depends on the MNE's overall knowledge sourcing practice and is weaker when MNE subsidiaries’ knowledge management prioritizes external sources of knowledge. Technical summary: Multinational enterprises (MNEs) face multiple institutional contexts across and within countries. We analyze subnational institutions in the local environment of MNE subsidiaries to investigate their impact on subsidiaries’ knowledge sourcing-strategies. Drawing on institutional and transaction cost economics, we argue that the degree of local R&D outsourcing is greater in high quality subnational institutional contexts. However, the quality of local institutions has less impact on the degree of R&D outsourcing by subsidiaries that are more open to external knowledge. These subsidiaries are more experienced in collaborating with external partners and, thus, have developed internal mechanisms to protect their intellectual property even in low quality institutional contexts. We test our arguments on a survey of MNE subsidiaries in four Eastern member states of the European Union. Copyright © 2016 Strategic Management Society.

Indeed, this new Agile-Stage-Gate hybrid approach represents a significant change to our thinking about how new-product development should be done since the introduction of today's popular gating systems thirty years ago! The article shows how Agile emerged in the IT industry and early attempts to integrate it with gating models, also in the IT world. The article moves on to the recent use of this hybrid model by manufacturers, and the results achieved by early adopters when implementing this new system in industries from food to heavy equipment. In terms of implementation, the details of the new Agile-Stage-Gate system are presented, including the “Power of Nine” – the three key artefacts (such as sprints and scrums); three important tools (such as sprint backlogs and burndown charts), and the three vital roles (such as the product owner and the scrum master) needed to make it work. Agile from the IT world cannot be directly integrated into Stage-Gate for physical products without some important modifications, however. These needed adjustments – such as redefining a “done sprint” and how to present versions of the product or “protocepts” for continuous customer feedback – are outlined, complete with a case study from an equipment manufacturer. Additionally, the article identifies and deals with ten important issues and apparent inconsistencies that arise when implementing this new system for B2B products. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Agile; Gating; Hybrid; New-product process; Stage-Gate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995595625

The paper proposes a theoretical framework for thinking about the ghostly by combining Freud’s concept of the uncanny with theorizing in cultural geography on collapses of linear time as well as with Avery Gordon’s sociological work on ghostly matters. Empirically, the paper examines the ghostly nature of strategy interruptions through a detailed analysis of conversations between middle managers at a strategy seminar in a Danish local government. I portray the uncanny moments where the familiar account of organizational purposes is not so self-evident anymore, but all of a sudden appears rather disturbing. I show how middle managers envision other, darker futures and express the feeling that something else, something different from before, must be done, although they cannot say exactly what. Going beyond previous accounts of strategy interruption, for example as deliberate resistance by middle managers, the paper contributes with new insight into the moments where the neat ordering of organizational realities performed by corporate strategies breaks down and middle managers come into contact with the broader social and political stakes of their work. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Avery Gordon; ghostly moments; local government; middle management; organizational time; spectral turn; strategy; the uncanny",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994652582

When tempted by internet access, workers reciprocate fair wages less than without access. Nevertheless, a manager's decision to actively grant internet access might increase workers’ effort: we find that highly reciprocal workers perceive the autonomy such a policy gives as a gift which they reciprocate with high effort despite the temptation of the internet.

This paper applies an analytical hierarchy process approach to investigate the impact of select lean and green practices on performance benefits, and to evaluate the influence of lean and green paradigms on overall performance of SMEs. Total productive maintenance is identified as the most important lean practice, while ISO 14001is the most significant green practice.

The practice of producing food in and around cities is championed as a method to reduce environmental impacts of urban food demands (reducing distance from farm to fork – ‘food miles’) whilst conferring a number of ancillary benefits to host cities (runoff attenuation, urban heat island mitigation) and ex-urban environments (carbon sequestration). Previous environmental assessments have found urban agriculture to be more sustainable than conventional agriculture when performed in mild climates, though opposite findings emerge when external energy inputs are significant. In this study we perform an environmental life cycle assessment of six urban farms in Boston and New York City, US producing lettuce and tomatoes, with conventional counterparts across six impact categories. Performance of urban agriculture was system dependent and no farm provided superior performance to conventional for all indicators. High-yield, heated, greenhouse production of tomatoes has potentially higher environmental burdens than conventional methods in terms of climate change (267–369%) and non-renewable resource depletion (108–239%), driven primarily by external energy inputs. Heated lettuce production systems showed similar trends. Low-tech, empty-lot farming appears to hold some advantages in terms of climate change burdens and resource use, though water and land usage was found to be elevated relative to conventional lettuce and tomatoes. Open rooftop farming apparently provides benefits if high yield crops (e.g. tomatoes) are cultivated, otherwise significant capital inputs detrimentally affect environmental performance. In general, the benefits of reduced food miles may be overwhelmed by energy inputs and inefficient use of production inputs. A comparison of urban agriculture and solar panels showed that the latter would confer greater benefits to mitigate climate change per unit area. Thus, urban agriculture may not be the optimal application of space in northern cities to improve urban environmental performance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Food; Food systems; Life cycle assessment; Urban agriculture; Urban design; Urban systems","Agriculture; Carbon; Climate change; Environmental management; Food products; Food supply; Fruits; Life cycle; Food system; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Urban agricultures; Urban design; Urban systems; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990818611

Both markets and institutions are inherently ambiguous and employers therefore have to settle for plausible – rather than accurate – rational strategies among many alternatives through so-called sensemaking. Sensemaking refers to the process by which employers continuously make sense of their competitive environment by building causal stories of competitive advantages. The article therefore tries to provide a better understanding of how preferences for collectivism are formed, sustained and potentially changed by identifying dominant and competing stories that either reinforce or challenge preferences for collectivism. Hereby, the article fills a theoretical, empirical and methodological void in studies that allude to the ambiguous role of markets and institutions but do not study how actors deal with this ambiguity. The sensemaking concept is illustrated with an analysis of wage bargaining in Denmark during the recent recession when Danish labour cost competitiveness was in a deplorable state. However, unlike countries in similar situations, for example Finland and Sweden, Danish employers retained a coordinated industry-level bargaining system, which makes it an interesting paradox to study from the vantage point of sensemaking. © 2016, © Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA), SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.","Collective action; collective bargaining; Denmark; employer’s associations; sensemaking; wage bargaining",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990203689

The absence of a practical, validated scale to assess this construct restricts research related to career distress and limits practitioners who need to assess and treat it.

Three of the 12 items examined were removed as they did not fit the Rasch model or were not invariant across groups. The remaining 9 items, which we combined into a scale labeled the Career Distress Scale, demonstrated excellent psychometric properties, meaning that both researchers and practitioners can use it with confidence.

We hypothesize that the transition to a green economy is about extending the possibility frontier outwards towards a greener economy while at the same time limiting the “action space” at the brown economy end; a normative evaluation framework is presented to assess transitions correspondingly. We elaborate on the emerging lessons for governance by examining evidence from five selected European case studies, and provide a non-exhaustive list of impacts that government intervention may have on the action spaces available at different system levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Governance; Green economy; Innovation; Natural capital; Social equity; Transition management","Industrial engineering; Innovation; Production engineering; Governance; Green economies; Natural capital; Social equity; Transition management; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990178122

In this paper a cross-entropy (CE) based solution methodology is developed in order to cope with complex combinatorial problems. The NP-hard problem of designing and planning a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) is considered. Furthermore, a multi-product multi-period CLSC network in a mixed-integer programming structure is regarded. On the other side, cross-entropy is one of the newly developed and successful metaheuristic algorithms. Thus, in order to achieve better solutions in comparison with current solution methodologies, a cross-entropy algorithm is developed for the first time in CLSC design and planning. Then, the capabilities of the cross-entropy algorithm are elevated, in order to achieve solutions that are more robust. Therefore, an algorithm, which is called “advanced cross-entropy” (ACE) is proposed. Finally, two presented CE-based algorithms are compared with a developed genetic algorithm (GA) for the same problem. GA is the most well-known metaheuristic algorithm, which has been abundantly developed in CLSC. Results prove that both of proposed CE-based algorithms dominate current methodologies. Both can find acceptable solutions in comparison with GA. Furthermore, the proposed advanced cross-entropy performs even better than CE in the quality of solutions and time. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced cross-entropy; Closed-loop supply chain; Cross-entropy; Genetic algorithm","Complex networks; Computational complexity; Entropy; Integer programming; Packet networks; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Complex combinatorial problem; Cross entropy; Meta heuristic algorithm; Mixed integer programming; Nondeterministic polynomial; Supply chain network design; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990062895

Through an analysis based on stakeholder theory, this article defines the constellations of stakeholders that make energy renovations happen. The research case, a small hotel in Denmark, is quite unique as most energy renovation research is related to housing or apartment buildings rather than small service companies, even though hotels and other small service companies do in general have high energy consumption. Based on a longitudinal case study (2008–2012), we show how two different renovation initiatives fail. Then the stakeholder constellations change and an engineer manages to create progress by actively involving the users of the buildings in the development of solutions and by coordinating the interests of the other stakeholders. Energy renovations in small service companies depend on key stakeholders that possess knowledge about energy renovations. Facilitating energy renovations is not a matter of “selling an idea” or “convincing the owner” to invest in a certain technology. It is dependent on the key stakeholders’ access to an appropriate knowledge network and active coordination and trust between relevant stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Energy renovation; Process; Stakeholders; Sustainable buildings","Apartment houses; Energy utilization; Hotels; Intelligent buildings; Processing; Apartment buildings; Energy renovation; Energy-saving measures; High energy consumption; Knowledge networks; Longitudinal case study; Stakeholders; Sustainable building; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990032632

In addition, combining difference-in-differences with propensity score and exact (both simple and categorical) matching methods, we assess the effect of R&D subsidies between treated (subsidy recipients) and controls (subsidy non-recipients) as well as between differently treated (small, medium and large subsidy recipient) firms.

This study accordingly argues that community members' perceptions of the brand community character (PBCC) should lead to positive outcomes for both the community and the brand. Neither PBCC nor its three characteristics have been measured empirically previously, so this study develops an initial scale.

Based on these distinctions, the performance criteria of existing studies used in an empirical review of management and performance are classified.

The Lisbon Treaty, which relaxed the voting requirements in the Council, accelerated its adoption. In the ‘shadow of the vote’, opponents (mainly continental CMEs) abandoned the defence of the status quo for less exacting legislation. The majority of Member States instead understood that consensus was necessary to appease the domestic concerns of countries like Germany and to strengthen their negotiating position vis-à-vis the Parliament. Despite the inevitable watering-down, the final law modifies domestic pension arrangements across the EU, thereby benefiting mobile workers. The implications are twofold. First, political economists should take into account the growing European influence on domestic pension policy-making.

This article sets out to develop environmental supplier selection criteria for circular supply chains. The method draws upon a consequential life cycle assessment and the monetized environmental impact of four alternative fuel suppliers in the cement industry. The best supplier performs three times better than the worst supplier in terms of environmental impact, thereby exemplifying the need for this study. The findings also show how three supplier selection criteria explain most of the environmental impact of selecting a supplier in a circular supply chain. First, supplier selection might impact environmentally preferred waste handling activities. Second, sourcing from a supplier located on an under-supplied market may lead to indirect transport as the players on that market may source on other markets to compensate for the diverted products. Third, low usability of the discarded product compared to the substituted virgin material may lead to additional emissions. The three criteria must be considered simultaneously when selecting suppliers in circular supply chains since focusing on a single criterion may negatively affect the other criteria. The findings contribute to circular supply chain literature by proposing and demonstrating the need for environmental supplier selection criteria in circular supply chains. Moreover, this study is relevant for achieving cleaner production in the cases where firms increasingly rely on the use of discarded products as a virgin fuel or material substitute. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuels; Cement; Circular supply chains; Consequential life cycle assessment; Municipal solid waste; Supplier selection","Alternative fuels; Cement industry; Cements; Commerce; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Pollution control; Cleaner production; Consequential LCA; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Supplier selection; Virgin materials; Waste handling; Waste recoveries; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038883083

We conducted 40 interviews at 24 firms in Mexico to explore emerging HRM systems in narcoterrorism environments. The interviews were complemented with a quantitative content analysis of 204 news stories to explore the direct and indirect impacts of narcoterrorism on firms. Our analysis of firms’ responses with respect to HRM systems, which is supported by our quantitative analysis on the impacts of narcoterrorism, indicates that trust appears to shape HRM systems. We identified an adaptation strategy to design HRM systems based on a combination of strict employee’s screening and control an emphasis on humanistic practices such as soft-skills training and development, and a flexible work schedule, which appears to facilitate the development of trust in narcoterrorism environments. Identifying the similarities of objects and issues in the narcoterrorism context can help develop an understanding of this local phenomenon, with implications for the HRM and terrorism literatures on a global scale. Our findings highlight the importance of reinforcing values such as trust, openness, involvement and participation to develop a strong HRM system to adapt to narcoterrorism environments. © 2015, Taylor & Francis.","HRM systems; Mexico; narcoterrorism; strategic HRM; terrorism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945156233

Different statistical models (e.g. Poisson, geometric) are used to model the distribution of noninformative terms, producing different DFR models. An informative termisthen detected by measuring the divergence of its distribution from the distribution of non-informative terms. However, thereislittle empirical evidence that the distributions of non-informative terms used in DFR actually fit current datasets. Practically this risks providing a poor separation between informative and non-informative terms, thus compromising the discriminative power of the ranking model. We present a novel extension to DFR, which first detects the best-fitting distribution of non-informative terms in a collection, and then adapts the ranking computation to this best-fitting distribution. We call this model Adaptive Distributional Ranking (ADR) because it adapts the ranking to the statistics of the specific dataset being processed each time.

A drawback of traditional LSH schemes is that they may have false negatives, i.e., the recall is less than 100%. This limits the applicability of LSH in settings requiring precise performance guarantees. Building on the recent theoretical ""CoveringLSH"" construction that eliminates false negatives, we propose a fast and practical covering LSH scheme for Hamming space called Fast CoveringLSH (fcLSH). Inheriting the design benefits of CoveringLSH our method avoids false negatives and always reports all near neighbors. Compared to CoveringLSH we achieve an asymptotic improvement to the hash function computation time from O(dL) to O(d + Llog L), where d is the dimensionality of data and L is the number of hash tables. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that fcLSH is comparable (and often superior) to traditional hashing-based approaches for search radius up to 20 in high-dimensional Hamming space.

The dueling bandits model addresses the key issue of which pair of rankers to compare at each iteration. Methods for simultaneously comparing more than two rankers have recently been developed. However, the question of which rankers to compare at each iteration was left open. We address this question by proposing a generalization of the dueling bandits model that uses simultaneous comparisons of an unrestricted number of rankers.

Despite attempts to develop a broader understanding of culture, cultural policy still seems to reproduce the dichotomies, and to value one over the other. In this article, we would argue for an expanded understanding of cultural democracy, which may serve as a starting point for a turn of perspective of arts advocacy and cultural policy—the perspective we call an expressive cultural democracy. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Arts management; arts participation; cultural policy; expressive cultural democracy; notions of art and culture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992626283

Scarce attention is paid to how these ventures grow, if at all, beyond their start-up phase or initial internationalization phase. This paper aims to explore how international new ventures transition from the internationalizing phase to the phase of being international, and whether they actually made it to that phase. Understanding whether and how these ventures reach their “made-it” point would contribute to our understanding of how early internationalization affects a venture’s survival and growth. In this, the authors draw on the dynamic capability theory of the firm. Design/methodology/approach: Given the scarcity of theoretical understanding and empirical evidence in this substantive area of research, the authors adopted a multiple case study methodology for the purpose of theory building. Following an intensity sampling strategy, they purposefully selected information-rich, but not extreme two-case companies. The authors initially collected unobtrusive data in the form of running records and mass-media news reports from the inception of the case companies. They then conducted in-depth interviews with key decision makers of the case companies, namely, their co-founders and CEOs. Critical incident technique guidelines for data analysis were employed. Findings: Grounded in data, the following constructs emerged related to value creation: strategic experimentation, gestalt tensions and legitimacy lies. Entrepreneurs experiment with and reconfigure their venture at several levels: goal (vision), decision (strategic) and behavioral (tactical) levels of the organizational gestalt to reach a threshold level of practiced activity. Entrepreneurs’ strategic experimentation efforts are fueled by tensions that exist at these three levels of the organizational gestalt. During this experimentation process, entrepreneurs may tell legitimacy lies to legitimate their ventures in the eyes of their stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: Given the instrument the authors used to explore the issues and concerns identified above, the results are limited in scope. However, a number of questions and conjectures are put forward to guide future research in this currently under-researched area of international entrepreneurship. The authors have also suggested using the concept of turning point in future research to advance the understanding of the dynamic capability view of international new ventures. Practical implications: Understanding whether and how international new ventures reach their made-it points would contribute to the understanding of how early internationalization affects international new ventures’ organizational survival and growth. Originality/value: The authors have put forward the concept of the made-it point to aid international entrepreneurship researchers to investigate the continued growth, evolutionary patterns and the organizational survival of international new ventures. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Dynamic capability; International entrepreneurship; International new ventures; Made-it point; Theory building; Turning point",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992390113

Box 159, Aalborg, DK-9100, Denmark","In Vietnam, the middle class is expected to grow from 12 million to 33 million people between 2012 and 2020. The growth causes an increase as well as a shift in consumption. Products that were not accessible or affordable before will become increasingly so, such as cars, dishwashers, meat products and air-conditioning. In urban areas the changes are most prominent and so are the side effects: increased amounts of waste, smog, pollution and use of fossil energy or pesticides. The main objective of this study was to identify sustainable behaviour that followed or did not follow from the intervention project GetGreen Vietnam. 604 urban middle class consumers participated in a series of sustainable consumption trainings. Before, during and after the trainings, quantitative and qualitative data was collected on 90 sustainable actions. 64% of the participants self-reported to be engaged in a sustainable action before the intervention and this percentage increased to 80% after. The group environment and activity-based meetings of GetGreen Vietnam project (GGVN) were critical for the success of the intervention. Participants reported that before GGVN certain actions were already habitual as a money saving strategy (e.g. sparse electricity use or food leftovers re-use) or due to past scarcity (e.g. sparse water use). Many participants reported the intention to buy sustainable products but fewer participants took action to do so. A powerful strategy toward more sustainable consumption in Vietnam can be to create more group-based activities around the themes of energy and shopping for food. A twofold approach is needed that both installs new sustainable consumption patterns and keeps old habits rooted in daily rituals. Role models should set an example for the young population and consumers and (Vietnamese) producers should be better connected to increase mutual trust and transparency. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Asia; Behaviour change; Emerging markets; Intention–action gap; Pro-environmental behaviour; Sustainability","Air conditioning; Behavioral research; Water conservation; Asia; Behaviour changes; Emerging markets; Intention-action gap; Pro-environmental behaviour; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958214536

After decades of numerous piecemeal medical and managerial quality development programs in both countries, a nationwide mandatory accreditation system was introduced in the Danish health services in 2009. Nationwide quality indicator projects are also found in Sweden, but there has been political attempt to introduce a compulsory system. This article seeks to explain this difference. It argues, first, that resistance from the medical professions blocked the introduction of compulsory, nationwide quality systems in both countries for decades. Second, the implementation of the Danish accreditation system was triggered by a combination of unintended policy learning produced by local reforms in two counties and of the Ministry of Health’s carefully orchestrated policy process that served to co-opt critical voices in the medical profession. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Historical institutionalism; path dependency; policy learning; quality management systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958530409

It applies explorative case studies in Danish and Chinese engineering firms to discover how the globalisation process of product development differs from Danish and Chinese perspectives. The paper uses internationalisation and global product development theory to explain similarities and differences in the approaches. Grounded in case study results, a new model for internationalisation is proposed. The new model expands the internationalisation process model to include steps of product development and collaborative distributed development beyond sourcing, sales and production elements. The paper then provides propositions for how to further develop the suggested model, and how western companies can learn from the Chinese approaches, and globalise their product development activities from the front end of the value chain rather than from the back-end. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","China; Global product development; internationalisation; offshoring; outsourcing","Mobile telecommunication systems; Outsourcing; Supply chain management; China; Distributed development; Engineering firms; Global product development; Internationalisation; Off-shoring; Process Modeling; Product development activities; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979502273

This means that RMS recommendations often are not appropriate for real-time competitive situations. Dynamic pricing (DP) is an extension of RMS that dynamically calculates the optimal price, taking into account the airline's strategy, customer-specific information and real-time alternative offerings. By optimizing the contribution within the shopping session, DP has a more current and detailed view of demand and can improve RMS performance. We investigated the performance of DP using two simulators, Alteá Benchmarking Engine and Passenger Origin Destination Simulator and demonstrate that DP can deliver substantial revenue benefits with no modification to existing revenue management (RM) processes. However, the deployment of DP into the airline distribution process will be a challenge, because it affects all shopping and downstream processes, such as ticketing, servicing, revenue accounting, RM and interline settlement, that rely on information from existing fare aggregators. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of DP are so compelling that we believe the effort to bring this technology into practice is warranted. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","Alteá Benchmarking Engine (ABE); distribution; Dynamic pricing (DP); global distribution systems (GDS); Passenger Origin Destination Simulator (PODS); revenue management system (RMS)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037081019

In this paper, the authors suggest a participative knowledge management approach to empower manufacturing workers. Starting from a comprehensive empirical analysis of the existing work practices in a manufacturing company, the authors have developed and validated a knowledge management system prototype. The prototype is aimed for training, problem solving, and facilitating the discovery, acquisition, and sharing of manufacturing knowledge. The conducted evaluation of the prototype indicates that workers' skills and level of work satisfaction will increase since the knowledge management system allows faster problem solving by finding better solutions for observed defects. © Copyright 2016, IGI Global.","Defect management; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge management; Social factory","Defects; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Manufacture; Problem solving; Defect management; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge management system; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing knowledge; Manufacturing process; Manufacturing workers; Work satisfactions; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013278113

Appropriate design and implementation of IS integration is typically a precondition for enabling a majority of the anticipated business benefits of a combined organization. Often, IS integration projects are subject to deficiencies (e.g., loss of the target firm’s business capabilities with expedited integration) that limit value creation. Drawing on a configurational perspective, we reanalyze 37 published case studies of problematic IS integrations and identify the potential deficiencies and how they are produced. Our findings reveal nine causal configurations that together explain deficiency as a consequence of multiple paths of interconnected mechanisms and contextual conditions that drive their actualization. Finally, based on a post hoc analysis of 25 cases where no negative outcomes are reported, we discuss approaches for managing IS integration to avoid realizing the actualization of deficiencies.

Therefore, there is a special concern regarding the control of environmental indicators reported by these companies. However, it is difficult to compare the environmental performance between them because of the heterogeneity of such indicators used in the companies’ sustainability reports. Thus, this paper proposes an assessment framework that consolidates environmental sustainability indicators reported by oil and gas companies into an integrative index. This index allows performing a benchmarking of the oil and gas industry. The proposed framework is based on a multi-criteria approach which uses an S-curve scale transformation for standardizing the indicators and multi-attribute utility theory for consolidating the indicators. We investigated international sustainability guidelines to define the main environmental indicators to be compared and then analyzed environmental performance data collected from eleven top global oil and gas companies. As a result, we identify nine main indicators and rank the eleven companies according to their overall scores. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impacts; Environmental indicators; Multi-criteria analysis; Oil and gas industry","Benchmarking; Environmental management; Gas industry; Gases; Public utilities; Sustainable development; Environmental indicators; Environmental performance; Environmental performance indices; Environmental sustainability; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multi-attribute utility theory; Multi-criteria approach; Oil and Gas Industry; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012048292

Health authorities tend to attribute their health problems to their lifestyle, for example refraining from participation in recreational physical activity (PA). However, little is known about the perspectives of the targets of health promotion, that is, their perceptions of and lived experiences with health recommendations. In this article we investigate minority ethnic women’s attitudes and practices, in particular with regard to PA. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 33 female migrant cleaners from non-western countries which provided insights into their everyday lives. We analysed the material drawing on the literature related to minority ethnic women and recreational PA, with a focus on Foucauldian scholars who have used the concepts of governmentality and disciplinary power. The interviewees considered weight loss the main benefit of recreational PA; this did, however, not lead to participation. Constraints to participation were exhaustion and lack of time caused by the demands of the women’s jobs and a ‘second shift’ at home. These findings confirm that the preoccupation with a healthy lifestyle is a privilege that requires socio-economic resources. Therefore, health policies must adapt to the needs of marginalised groups and take structural factors into consideration, such as the organisation of the labour market and the gendered division of work. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ethnic minorities; exercise; gender; Health messages; qualitative research; social class",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992691721

To better understand the unique behavioral characteristics of entrepreneurs and the causes of these mixed results, we perform a large ""lab-in-the-field"" experiment comparing entrepreneurs to managers (a suitable comparison group) and employees (n D 21288). The results indicate that entrepreneurs perceive themselves as less risk averse than managers and employees, in line with common wisdom. However, when using experimental incentivized measures, the differences are subtler. Entrepreneurs are only found to be unique in their lower degree of loss aversion, and not in their risk or ambiguity aversion. This combination of results might be explained by our finding that perceived risk attitude is not only correlated to risk aversion but also to loss aversion. Overall, we therefore suggest using a broader definition of risk that captures this unique feature of entrepreneurs: their willingness to risk losses. © 2016 INFORMS.","Ambiguity aversion; Entrepreneurs; Lab-in-the field experiment; Loss aversion; Managers; Risk aversion","Managers; Risks; Ambiguity aversion; Entrepreneurs; Field experiment; Loss aversion; Risk aversion; Human resource management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991711452

The predominant model of how both public managers and citizens evaluate performance suggests that satisfaction judgments about performance are based on a comparison of performance to some adapted standard like expectations or goals. However, in a number of experiments we show that perceptions of performance and satisfaction are formed in ways that are not so consistent and better explained by an intuitive mode of thinking. The results question the validity of citizen satisfaction as a measure of performance but also raise more general questions about how performance information is processed by citizens and public managers. Suggestions for a more adequate theory of the relationship between performance and satisfaction and implications for the use of performance information in public organizations are presented and discussed. © The Author 2015.

Deeper insights on the issue are provided by examining the inter-relationship between knowledge spillovers from imports and inward FDI. Furthermore, human capital is added to the discussion as one of the appropriability factors for knowledge spillovers, with special focus on its quality-content, using journal publications and patent applications. Applying cointegration estimation method on 20 European countries from 1995 to 2010, the direct effects of FDI-related as well as import-related spillovers on domestic productivity are confirmed. Furthermore, a strong complementary relationship is found between knowledge spillovers through the channels of imports and inward FDI. When considering quality-adjusted human capital, countries with better human capital are found to benefit not only from direct productivity effects, but also from absorption and transmission of international knowledge spillovers through imports and inward FDI. Finally, technological distance with the frontier does not appear to play a role in the absorption of import and FDI related knowledge spillovers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Foreign direct investment; Human capital; International trade; Knowledge spillovers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990855043

One reason is the relatively naïve nature of current methods, which focus on the evolution of a single characteristic in a single environment. This assumption constrains the analysis of real selection processes in which firms operate in several markets and their products have several characteristics that interact to determine fitness. This entails that measurement of economic selection becomes confounded: characteristics that are associated with firm growth are not becoming more frequent in the population. The reason for confounded selection is that characteristics interact to augment or constrain the rate and direction of evolution and one-dimensional, single trait replicator dynamics cannot cope with confounded selection. The contribution of this paper is to develop an approach that serves to explicitly analyse confounded selection. The primary elements of the method are the selection gradients of the characteristics and the covariance matrix of the characteristics. Based on these, the method motivates a taxonomy of selection based on the interaction of characteristics. Applying the method to a population of firms will shed light on potentially confounded selection. It will reveal the indirect effects of characteristics on selection and the augmentation and constraints created thereby. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Economic selection; Multi-trait selection; Price’s equation; Replicator dynamics; Statistics of evolution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990838784

Rather it is deeply connected to organization as a reaction to the gradual emergence in Western culture of the management and administration of time. As an acquired capacity of those able to tell and endure time in an organized manner, boredom is a perceived loss of meaning inferred by the lived experience of a discrepancy between the involvement with transient means in everyday life and their value in a larger vision of existence. But boredom also signifies a concurrent protest against such a loss, which potentially leads new possibilities with it. In this essay, I explore the connection between boredom and organization, focusing on these two interrelated aspects of the phenomenon: how boredom can be understood as an experience of a loss of meaning, but also how this loss itself can be viewed as an imperative towards meaning that remains the source of new forms of organizing. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","boredom; human relations and practices; industrialization; organization; organization studies; temporality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989951037

This inequality in geological resource distribution may lead to potential constraints and bottlenecks of a steady resource supply. In the context of strategic planning and innovation, and in scientific literature, this aspect is often referred to as geopolitical supply risk. In the past few decades, cobalt crisis, the oil embargo, and the more recent Rare Earth Elements (REEs) issue are the best examples regarding the geopolitical supply risk of mineral resources. The aim of this study is to present a historical overview of the development in geopolitical supply risk of 52 metals during the past two decades and to support an assessment of such risk in the future, i.e. 2050. A geographical mapping of metals primary production in 1994 and 2013 is included which shows a shift from developed economies to developing economies over this time period. Our analysis demonstrates that the geopolitical supply risk of metals has been fluctuating during the past two decades due to change in the number and production share of producing countries. During this time period, Chinese share of global metals production has increased from 23% to 44%. China, today, is also the dominant supplier of 34 metals, out of which 23 are considered as critical resources by the European Commission. The future geopolitical supply risk is less dependent on the present production distribution and more dependent on the location of current geological resources and the future discoveries, as well as on the technological development to improve profitability of mining the currently sub-economical resources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Critical resources; Geopolitical supply risk; Global transition of mining; Metals; Primary production","Geology; Metals; Mineral resources; Structural geology; Critical resources; Global transitions; Primary production; Production distribution; Rare earth elements (REEs); Resource distribution; Supply risk; Technological development; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988908279

A growing literature stream, however, sharply departs from this view by suggesting that end-users often play a critical role with regard to sustainable innovation. To further consolidate this field, the purpose of this paper is threefold. First, the paper summarizes and synthesizes key insights within the field based on 84 papers published from 1992 to 2015. Second, we offer a framework to understand the current observed barriers and drivers to this innovation process, suggesting two distinct end-user innovation types: independent and facilitated. The end-users' motivation, ability and opportunity to innovate serve as the deductive analytical tool utilized for discerning these drivers and barriers. Third, the paper suggests how this form of innovation may be ameliorated from a policy perspective. The paper reveals that the literature on end-user innovation within sustainability is both diverse and compartmentalized. Hence, policy mechanisms designed to support this type of innovation process need to be tailored to the independent or facilitated framework in which the end-user resides and to take into account how each framework is necessitated by a different actor logic and motivation, resulting in the pursuit of different innovation types. It is concluded that the literature focusing on independent end-user innovation typically highlights policy aimed at enabling end-users with the necessary skills and resources to innovate, whereas literature focusing on facilitated end-user innovation typically emphasizes creating platforms that enable the effective introduction of end-user knowledge into an already existing framework. The paper offers an overview and a framework for researchers to further explore this diverse and compartmentalized field. Practitioners may especially benefit from the proposed policy tools, including the overview of potential tools for drawing on end-user competences and resources. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer policy; MOAB model; Open innovation; Sustainable innovation; User; User innovation","Innovation; Sustainable development; Innovation process; Innovation types; Open innovation; Policy mechanisms; Sustainable products; Systematic literature review; User; User innovation; Motivation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988890353

The carbon footprint was 10–13 kg CO2-eq/kg edible product from dairy based calves and cows of all types and 30–45 kg CO2-eq/kg edible product from young animals of specialized beef breed systems. The use of non-renewable energy per kg edible product shows a relatively small variation among systems. Improving the utilization of the carcass by producing new edible products not conventionally produced represents an opportunity for reducing the environmental impact per kg edible product. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Beef production system; Edible products; Greenhouse gas emissions; Non-renewable energy; Slaughtering","Beef; Byproducts; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Meats; Beef production; Edible products; Environmental performance; Non-renewable energy; Primary production; Production system; Slaughtering; Slaughtering process; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988849762

We argue that a major cause of the poor innovative performance is the slow adaption of the scientific system to the novel research technologies made available by the progress in the life sciences – rather than resistance of practitioners. We interpret the changes in the organization of medical research through the lenses of the theory of New Sciences, which puts forward that the application of novel research technologies promotes new epistemological and methodological approaches to the investigation of complex phenomena, increasing interdisciplinary intellectual exchanges. In oncology, Translational Research, that embodies the features of a new science, coexists with the standard model of knowledge production in clinical medicine. Our comparison of the two approaches finds that Translational Research allows investigations across diverse and cognitively distant knowledge bases, thanks to the intensive use of research technologies that emerge from fundamental research. Unlike standard studies, the scientific impact of translational studies benefits from the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach. However, translational studies have an overall lower impact than their counterpart. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive complementarities; Interdisciplinary research; Organization of scientific research; Research technologies; Science-technology link","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Cognitive complementarities; Interdisciplinary research; Research technologies; Science technologies; Scientific researches; Medicine; cognition; interdisciplinary approach; medical geography; research institution; science and technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988382979

There is evidence that the social cohesion that social networks provide is critical for societies to prosper economically and for development to be sustainable. These social networks and the functions they perform co-exist with, influence and are influenced by the business networks of connected firms and other economic organisations that surround them. This is increasingly so in our ever-more-complex, internationalized and connected world. This paper explores the potential consequences of this influence via a case study that considers the changes to a community's social network and the associated norms emerging from the growing influence of a microfinance providers' network. A case study reports the impact of microfinance on a particular Bangladesh rural community. We show there is a breakdown in traditional social networks in this and other poor rural villages brought about by the taking of micro loans when the families have no means of paying them back. This increased indebtedness to NGOs is perpetuating their poverty and diminishing the community's quality of life including their traditions of bounded solidarity, where families support each other as best they can through common adversities. The case concludes by considering the mechanisms underpinning these processes. This includes competitive structure, i.e. the highly saturated and interconnected structure of the micro finance industry, the dominance of this business network in the economic structure of rural Bangladesh and changing norms, in particular the changes to traditional forms of financial exchange and associated support and risk management. We conclude that public policy and a different business model that is more accountable and altruistic are needed to guide this and other networks whose goals are economic development of the poor. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Balance theory; Business networks; Microfinance; Social capital; Social networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976500268

Therefore, this paper examines earlier research into community-led local development (CLLD) initiatives in rural areas of Europe to develop our understanding of the meaning and scope of rural social innovation. We draw on a Schumpeterian view where innovations emerge from new combinations of resources that bring about positive changes and create value in society. A Schumpeterian social innovation framework is derived as the basis for re-analysing data from previous evaluations of LEADER policy in five different national contexts. This elicits a clearer understanding of social innovation in a rural development context, identifying different processes and outcomes that create social value. As the CLLD agenda and the demand for innovation in Europe gather pace, our aspirations are to inform future research and other initiatives on how to integrate social innovation into the design and evaluation of new rural development policies and programmes. © 2016 ICCR Foundation.","community-led local development; LEADER; rural development; rural policy; social innovation","community resource management; innovation; local participation; planning method; research and development; research work; rural development; rural policy; social inclusion; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966708307

Thus, it seeks to answer the questions: How do we define and study the relational identity of a nonprofit organization (NPO)? How do stakeholders participate in NPO identity constructing practices? Theoretically, the study draws on and contributes to the relational conceptualization of organizational identity as a discursive accomplishment. Based on a discourse analysis of an online discussion on the micro-lending NPO Kiva, the studys findings point to complex articulations of both the organization and its stakeholders. Conclusively, the study suggests that NPO identity can be defined and studied through multiple discourses articulated by stakeholders. In addition, it points to understanding NPO identity alongside stakeholder identities, as stakeholders construct a number of different identities simultaneously.

However, its effects were far from uniform. While parts of Asia and Africa continued to grow fast, Europe experienced a large set back. This paper emphasizes three important factors: differences across countries in technological development; differences in capacities to exploit the opportunities offered by technology; and differences in the ability to compete in international market. A formal model, based on this approach, is developed and applied to data for 100 countries in the period 1997–2012. Empirical indicators reflecting the various factors are developed, a dataset constructed and econometric estimates of the model performed. The results are used to explore the factors behind the slowdown in economic growth, with a particular emphasis on the continuing stagnation in Europe. A major factor turns out to be the increased financialization of the economy. The negative effect of the growth of finance prior to the crisis is especially pronounced for the countries that suffered most during the crisis. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","competitiveness; crisis; economic growth; social capabilities; Technological capabilities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961210256

This article delivers a critical review of the conceptualizations of value chains in tourism. Two different approaches are identified. First, destination logic addresses the consumption steps and processes of the tourists and comprises the various needs for products and services. Second, supply chain logic, which, from an enterprise perspective, takes into consideration the composition of products and services with supplies from across business sectors, thus recognizes wider contributions to the economics of tourism. With reference to rural well-being tourism, the study outlines strategic alleys within these two logics. In the context of rural well-being tourism, gains for destinations can be achieved from both logics, but local rural areas may increase advantages of tourism with a profounder embracement of supply chain logic. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958035324

We study the stability of the value basis for buying organic food in China by means of two surveys with ordinary Chinese consumers collected in 2009 (n = 529) and 2012 (n = 478) outside supermarkets selling organic food in Guangzhou, China. Consistent with previous studies in Western countries, we find that the attitude towards buying organic vegetables is related to the value type Schwarz terms “Universalism” and when Universalism is controlled, no other values increase explained variance. The value–attitude and the attitude–behavior relationships for organic vegetables are significant at both times and are not significantly different between the two time points. However, contrary to what we expected, the studied behavior (purchase of organic vegetables) is significantly related to basic values only in 2009, but unrelated in 2012. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of a sustainable consumption pattern in China and specifically for consumers adopting “green” solutions invented in the west, sometimes referred to as “green leap frogging”. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","China; Organic food; Structural equation modeling; Survey; Values","Food supply; Purchasing; Surveying; Surveys; China; Guangzhou , China; Leap-frogging; Organic foods; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable consumption; Values; Western countries; Vegetables",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933054693

However, the positive effect of brand personality on donors’ intention to engage pro-socially may be affected in cases in which NPOs provide monetary incentives to those donors. Relying on social exchange theory, the authors examine how monetary incentives and brand personality commonly affect the intention to donate and whether this effect varies based on the perceived trustworthiness of the NPO. The results of two experimental studies show that branding and incentivizing decisions should not be developed independently because monetary incentives do indeed undermine the positive effects of brand personality on the intention to donate. However, the effectiveness of incentives varies with the perceived level of trust in the NPO: highly trusted NPO services are harmed by monetary incentives, whereas less-trusted NPOs may even benefit. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Blood donation; Monetary incentives; Nonprofit organization; Social exchange theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924262358

Understanding the dynamics of software teams can be seen as highly important to successful project execution. Hence, for future project managers, knowledge about non-technical processes in teams is significant. In this paper, we present a course unit that provides an environment in which students can learn and experience the role of different communication patterns in distributed agile software development. In particular, students gain awareness about the importance of communication by experiencing the impact of limitations of communication channels and the effects on collaboration and team performance. The course unit presented uses the controlled experiment instrument to provide the basic organization of a small software project carried out in virtual teams. We provide a detailed design of the course unit to allow for implementation in further courses.

To set up, guide, and carry out SPI projects, and to measure SPI state, impact, and success, a multitude of different SPI approaches and considerable experience are available. SPI addresses many aspects ranging from individual developer skills to entire organizations. It comprises for instance the optimization of specific activities in the software lifecycle as well as the creation of organization awareness and project culture. In the course of conducting a systematic mapping study on the state-of-the-art in SPI from a general perspective, we observed Global Software Engineering (GSE) becoming a topic of interest in recent years. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a detailed investigation of those papers from the overall systematic mapping study that were classified as addressing SPI in the context of GSE. From the main study's result set, a set of 30 papers dealing with GSE was selected for an in-depth analysis using the systematic review instrument to study the contributions and to develop an initial picture of how GSE is considered from the perspective of SPI. Our findings show the analyzed papers delivering a substantial discussion of cultural models and how such models can be used to better address and align SPI programs with multi-national environments. Furthermore, experience is shared discussing how agile approaches can be implemented in companies working at the global scale. Finally, success factors and barriers are studied to help companies implementing SPI in a GSE context. © 2016 IEEE.","global software development; software process improvement; systematic literature review; systematic mapping study","Mapping; Process engineering; Software engineering; Global software development; Global software engineering; Software life cycles; Software Process Improvement; Software process improvements; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic Review; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994644499

Successfully orchestrating Global Software Engineering (GSE) has become the major success factor both for organizations and practitioners. Yet, more than a half of all distributed projects does not achieve the intended objectives and is canceled. This paper summarizes experiences from academia and industry in a way to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer. It is based on an evaluation of 10 years of research, and industry collaboration and experience reported at the IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering (ICGSE) series. The outcomes of our analysis show GSE as a field highly attached to industry and, thus, a considerable share of ICGSE papers address the transfer of Software Engineering concepts and solutions to the global stage. We found collaboration and teams, processes and organization, sourcing and supplier management, and success factors to be the topics gaining the most interest of researchers and practitioners. Beyond the analysis of the past conferences, we also look at current trends in GSE to motivate further research and industrial collaboration. © 2016 IEEE.","global software engineering; GSE; ICGSE; longitudinal study; near-shoring; offshoring; outsourcing","Human resource management; Industrial research; Outsourcing; Technology transfer; Global software engineering; ICGSE; Longitudinal study; Near shoring; Off-shoring; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994627456

It has been recognized that appropriate tool support is a prerequisite to improve cooperation within SE teams. In an effort to contribute to this line of research, we have designed and developed an infrastructure, called ABC4GSD, based on the models of Activity Theory (AT) and the principles of the Activity-Based Computing (ABC) paradigm. [Aim] In this paper, we present a study that empirically evaluates the ability of ABC4GSD in supporting teams cooperation. [Method] We designed and executed a study based on a scenario that simulated the Follow-The-Sun (FTS) strategy of Global SE (GSE). Our research design allowed us to ensure cooperation to be both computer-mediated as well as contained within observable short time-windows - the hand-off activities of the FTS strategy. [Results] Overall, the results show that the cooperation support provided by the ABC4GSD system has been positively perceived by the participants. Nonetheless, open issues stimulating further investigations have been raised especially due to a few mixed results. [Conclusions] Aware of the limitations of the simulated scenario, we conclude that the approach followed by the ABC4GSD system based on activities is desirable to improve the cooperation support in SE. Finally, our research approach based on simulating a scenario with geographical and temporal distribution can provide useful ideas for assessing collaborative technologies in SE. © 2016 IEEE.","cooperation; empirical; FTS; GSE; tool","Computation theory; Tools; Activity-based computing; Collaborative technologies; cooperation; empirical; Empirical evaluations; Research approach; Short time windows; Temporal distribution; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994619251

This study aims at identifying the critical success factors for promoting the sustainable development of biofuel industry and helping the stakeholders/decision-makers to draft the appropriate strategic measures for enhancing the sustainability of biofuel industry in China. A generic methodology in which the decision-makers are allowed to use linguistic terms to express their views and options, multiple decision-makers are allowed to participate in the decision-making, has been developed to prioritize the factors influencing the sustainability of biofuel industry and to identify the cause-effect relationships among these factors. The three factors, including government support degree, competitiveness, and local acceptability are identified as the most critical factors for promoting the sustainable development of biofuel industry in China, but they are all effects rather than the origins of the problems existed in the biofuel industry of China. In contrast, maturity, safety and reliability, complexity, conversion efficiency, and investment cost are the most important causes, and they are also the origins of the problems existed in the biofuel industry of China. Six effective strategic measures including popularizing the use of biofuels in large scales, subsidies and tax exemption policies, investing more on R&D on biofuel technologies, encouraging more private enterprises and joint ventures to participate in the biofuel industry, developing the integrated utilization manner of biofuels by further developing the byproducts of biofuels, and popularizing the use of biodiesel and bioethanol among the vehicle users through publicity and education have been proposed for promoting the sustainable development of China's biofuel industry according to the obtained results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biofuel; DEMATEL; Grey number; Sustainable development","Accident prevention; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Byproducts; Competition; Decision making; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Investments; Linguistics; Planning; Sustainable development; Taxation; Cause-effect relationships; Critical success factor; DEMATEL; Environmental contamination; Government supports; Grey decision making; Grey number; Integrated utilization; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969216947

However, a frequently overlooked but equally important benefit is the possibility for creating new revenue. The purpose of this paper is to examine which revenue streams the RSC enables for OEMs to utilize and how these streams are utilized in industrial practice. Design/methodology/approachFirst, the paper identifies the RSC-enabled revenue streams that are available to OEMs using a literature-based conceptual modeling approach. Second, using a set of eight cases the paper explores these streams’ utilization pattern and develops a set of propositions that explain the pattern. FindingsResults show a set of 12 distinct RSC-enabled revenue streams within three categories: new revenue through sales of used items, new revenue through sales of recovered items, and new revenue through added sales of virgin products. Six of these 12 streams are utilized in industrial practice. Among the propositions that explain the utilization pattern are the degree of component customization, product life-cycle longevity, and the value gap between used and recovered products. Originality/valueWhile extant literature concerning the relation between the RSC and the firm’s revenue is scarce, this paper contributes to the understanding of RSCs’ revenue generation potential and thus to the stream of literature that views the RSC as a value creator rather than a costly nuisance. Furthermore, the paper provides managers with a broad view of how their firm’s RSC can increase revenue from existing markets as well as create revenue from new markets. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case study research; Conceptual modelling; Original equipment manufacturer; Revenue; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983428250

Design/methodology/approachA survey was applied to 372 university students (mean age=20.4 years, SD=2.4) in Southern Chile. The questionnaire included the AFF questionnaire and the SWFL scale, questions about consumption and knowledge about functional food (FF) and socio-demographic characteristics. FindingsUsing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling, it was found that AFF directly and significantly influence students’ SWFL. A cluster analysis applied to the Z-scores from the factors obtained by the CFA classified three typologies: positive towards FF (36.3 per cent), moderately positive towards FF (43.0 per cent) and negative towards FF (20.7 per cent). The positive towards FF type had a significantly greater SWFL score than the negative towards FF type. The types differ according to consumption and knowledge about FF. Research limitations/implicationsThis study was conducted in the context of only one country in South America. Originality/valueThis study is the first that assesses the effect of AFF on SWFL in a sample of university students. Fostering positive attitudes towards FF will allow for a growth in the degree of SWFL of university students with features similar to those of the study sample. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitudes; Functional foods; Satisfaction with food-related life; University students","adult; Chile; cluster analysis; consumer; factorial analysis; functional food; human; major clinical study; questionnaire; statistical model; university student",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983268309

Based on a dialogical reflexive approach to case studies, we take our point of departure in theoretically identifying key CRM constituents and their interrelations, and we show how current theories within CRM build upon axioms of a traditional firm-centric view on value creation and fail to meet the challenges of new market structures and relations. This tension of axioms provides a point of direction for introducing the Pepsi Refresh Project as a case illustration of an alternative CRM practice that redefines CRM from company-driven to community-driven – and points towards relocating CRM from an overt to a covert brand and marketing communication strategy.

Based on a longitudinal ethnography of professionals in a Big Four accounting firm we analyse the process by which individual professionals make sense of their new roles and integrate the conflicting demands of professional and managerial logics. We find that individuals are active authors of their own identity scripts. We further observe considerable interpretive variation in how identity scripts are reproduced and enacted. We contribute to the emerging understanding of institutions as 'inhabited' by individuals and extend this literature by demonstrating that the institutional work of reinterpreting competing logics is based less of inter-subjective interactions, as prior literature has assumed, and is, instead, based on individual cognition and interpretive subjectivity. We also contribute to research in professional service firms by offering a conceptual model of the individual micro-processes required for successful archetypal change. © 2015 The Author(s) 2015.

This procedure may make the co-arbitrators appear partial and may lead to improper dissenting opinions and premature resignations, which may ultimately threaten the confidence in arbitration and arbitral awards, but the procedure does not remain common for nothing. The arbitration community therefore needs to reconsider the appointment procedure on a solid and deliberate basis, and such a basis is what the article provides. A number of experienced arbitration practitioners have advocated against the procedure for some of the reasons above, whereas other experienced arbitration practitioners have defended the procedure because of its practical advantages and underlying rationales. Each of the previous contributions to the debate sheds light on some important aspects of the procedure but leaves certain aspects and arguments unconsidered. The article approaches the appointment procedure from a neutral position. It identifies and considers the relevant rules, practices, and arguments in order to discuss the procedure's implications and the possible legal and contractual adjustments that may change these implications.

This article investigates the challenges of regulating psychosocial risks in the workplace. The difficulties lie in the particular nature of psychosocial risks: their complexity, uncertainty, value, and power divergences. Psychosocial risks therefore resemble 'wicked problems', typically characterized by unclear cause-effect relationships and uncertain solutions. We use the 'wicked problems' concept to show how workplace regulation, and particularly the enforcement in the form of inspection and audits of certified occupational health and safety management systems, face challenges in assessing psychosocial risks and the strategies used by regulators to overcome these challenges. While regulation has become more effective in several countries, a better understanding of the nature of the challenges is still needed. It is necessary to accept the uncertain nature of psychosocial risks in the search for more efficient regulation. Achieving more effective regulation should involve stakeholders in the workplace who deal with the prerogatives of management, and should help develop the competencies of the inspectors and auditors in the field. © 2016 Roskilde University.","Audit; Enforcement; Inspection; Standards; Wicked problems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028889205

In line with the theme of this special issue, it challenges conventional risk management practice against the background of former research results successfully finished decades ago. It is well-known that conventional practice frequently results in budget overruns of large projects. International reviews document that. Severe delays of schedules are also well-known. This paper describes successful research results from almost three decades ago, which successfully challenges this severe problem and has led to new practices. The research involved is an unusual mix: Scandinavian researchers from psychology, statistical theory and engineering economy. The resulting procedure has been widely used since around 1990 and challenges conventional procedures. The procedure is documented to be able to yield statistically correct prognoses, when the “rules of the game” have been correctly followed. After a short summary of the basic situation, this paper summarizes the research, followed by some resulting experiences, focusing on two recent studies each of 40 infrastructures and other major projects. In both sets, the actual final cost largely equaled the expected project cost. This result is a marked change from international past and present experience.

In addition, we provide overviews of institutional details of the Danish health care system, aggregate trends in health care expenditures and the relevant register data. Nearly two-thirds of expenditures are on hospitals and one-fifth on long-term care, with the remainder roughly equally split between primary care and prescription drugs. Health expenditures are higher for men than for women from ages 61 to 78, and otherwise higher for women. Between ages 50 and 80, hospital expenditures more than triple for men while more than doubling for women, and total health expenditures quadruple for men while tripling for women. The top 1 per cent of all spenders account for nearly one-quarter of total spending in a given year, and averaging over three years only reduces this fraction to one-fifth. The top 20 per cent of spenders in a given year are more likely to remain in that category two years later than not. The poorest fifth of the population aged 25 and above are responsible for more than twice as much spending on health as the richest, and this reverse social gradient is even stronger for long-term care and is stronger among men than among women, especially in hospital expenses. Expenditures in the year (over the three years) before death are nearly 12 times (respectively nine times) higher than average, but nevertheless are only 11 per cent (respectively a quarter) of lifetime spending. Out-of-pocket expenses on prescription drugs only amount to 3 per cent of total health expenditures and are less concentrated than these.

The aim of the research is to establish the behavior of customer orders in first-come-first-serve (FCFS) systems and the impact of order quantity variation on the planning environment. A discussion of assumptions regarding demand from various planning and control perspectives underlines that most planning methods are based on the assumption that demand in the form of customer orders are independently identically distributed and stem from symmetrical distributions. To investigate and illustrate the need to aggregate demand to live up to these assumptions, a simple methodological framework to investigate the validity of the assumptions and for analyzing the behavior of orders is developed. The paper also presents an analytical approach to identify the aggregation horizon needed to achieve a stable demand.

We postulate that the strategic interplay of platform layers will drive the competitive dynamics of platform-driven ubiquitous systems. This framework has been employed in a comparative case study between monopolistic (i.e., Pingit) and federated (i.e., Paym) mobile payment platforms to illustrate its applicability and yield principles on the nature and impact of competition among platform-driven ubiquitous systems. Preliminary findings indicate that monopolistic mobile digital platforms attempt to create unique configurals to obtain monopolistic power by tightly coupling platform layers, which are difficult to replicate. Conversely, federated digital platforms compete by dispersing the service layer to harness the collective resources from individual firms. Furthermore, the interaction and integration among platform layers give rise to commodity and value platform layers that translate into competitive battlegrounds among mobile payment services.

In this paper, a model for predicting product performance is proposed, taking into account design, assembly and process parameters live from production. This empowers production to maintain final product performance, instead of part quality. The PRECI-IN case study is used to demonstrate how the monitoring system can be used to efficiently guide corrective action to improve product performance. It is claimed that the monitoring system can be used to dramatically cut the time taken to identify, plan and execute corrective action related to typical quality issues. To substantiate this claim, two further cases comparable to PRECI-IN, in terms of complexity, material and manufacturing process, were taken from different industries. The interviews with quality experts revealed that the typical time taken for corrective action for both cases was accounted to be seven days. Using the monitoring system for the PRECI-IN case, similar corrective action would have been achieved almost immediately. © 2016 PEI, University of Maribor.

These professional struggles are often more important than what organization has a formal mandate over an issue. We highlight how ‘issue professionals’ operate in two-level professional and organizational networks to control issues. This two-level network provides the context for action in which professionals do their institutional work. The two-level network carries information about professional incentives and also norms about how issues should be treated and governed by organizations.

On the basis of an explorative empirical investigation of subsidiary initiative taking in the French subsidiaries of six German MNCs, the paper explores the activities that subsidiaries undertake to sell their initiatives, and the relationships among issue selling, subsidiary power and headquarters’ hierarchical power. The findings suggest that the use of issue-selling tactics is common when subsidiaries engage in initiative taking. In addition, the paper demonstrates that a low degree of issue selling is needed to obtain approval of an initiative in less asymmetrical headquarters–subsidiary power relationships (i.e. relationships in which subsidiaries are relatively powerful). In cases where power relationships are highly asymmetrical, issue selling is a necessity, but it is hardly a sufficient condition for obtaining headquarters’ approval. This renders issue selling to a second-rank power in subsidiary initiative taking, as it only works in conjunction with subsidiary power. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","issue-selling tactic; multinational corporation; organizational politics; subsidiary initiative; subsidiary power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983294311

The article demonstrates distinct opportunities offered by practice theory in researching the multiple lines of conflict and cooperation over local organizational practices, policies and strategies that emerge in the face of global HQ demands. Extant literature concentrates on how transfer outcomes are shaped by institutional or cultural distance at the national level and inter-unit relationships, often taking the subsidiary as a unit of analysis. Therefore, intra-unit conflicts over global practice sharing are under-researched, particularly how such conflicts are shaped by actors’ differential situatedness in the immediate societal context of the subsidiary. In explicating a practice theory agenda for the study of MNCs, we contribute to an understanding of how actors’ social positioning within and outside the firm, combined with their career opportunities, shape both the character and dynamics of intra-unit conflicts over the local configuration of organizational practices mandated by HQ. Building on an extended case study of an MNC in a Mexican special economic zone (SEZ), we thus examine how subsidiary actors accommodate, actively support and resist various parts of an HQ-mandated management control system. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Bourdieu; conflict; extended case study; MNC; politics; power; practice theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983247128

We re-review the psychology literature and in contrast to Hedberg, find that this definition of unlearning is not empirically warranted. We re-examine a selection of highly cited articles in the organisational literature that claim to have conducted empirical research into the Hedberg model of unlearning. We find none provide evidence of its existence. Typically, under the label ‘unlearning’ evidence is provided of a conventional process of theory-change, the setting aside (not deletion) of an established understanding in favour of new understanding when presented with perceived new facts. In all cases that we examine, clear alternative and less problematic concepts should provide a better conceptual framework for the research, such as learning, theory-change, discard of practice and extinction. It follows that the unlearning literature is not in fact the independent, scholarly and scientific literature that many of its adherents believe it to be. We recommend that for concepts allegedly imported from other disciplines more frequent commissioning of cross-disciplinary reviews may encourage the critical works so obviously lacking in the unlearning literature. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","forgetting; knowledge discard; organisational memory; routine; technological constitution; Unlearning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981718838

In this study, we engage the general public to identify and map a range of ecosystem services that originate in place-based, local knowledge and explore the context-dependent nature of subjective well-being. We conducted a PPGIS survey with 219 local residents in a Spanish agroforestry (dehesa) landscapes and analysed the spatial patterns of mapped ecosystem services, their relation to land cover, protected area and common land patterns. In addition, we explored the landscape values contributing to people's well-being; and the relationships between ecosystem services in different land covers, landscape values and socio-demographic characteristics. A mosaic of landscape types (i.e., the landscape) provided more ecosystem services (especially cultural and provisioning) to people compared with the individual land system of agroforestry. However, land tenure and public access significantly guided the spatial practices and values of the people beyond the preferred landscape types. The contribution of the landscape to well-being is largely related to values based on interactions among people and the landscape, as tranquillity/relaxation and people-people interactions such as being with family and friends. We discuss the specific contribution of agroforestry landscapes to the provision of ecosystem services and human well-being. We conclude that the integration of the applied methods of social-cultural assessment on the one hand links to ecosystem services frameworks but on the other hand represents a more holistic conceptualisation of people's benefits from landscapes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Dehesa; Landscape management; Landscape values; Participatory mapping; Public participation GIS (PPGIS); Silvopastoral","agroforestry; ecosystem service; GIS; land management; land use; local participation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978923807

The study takes a practice theoretical perspective, building on previous research on family consumption, and draws empirically on 35 interviews with 5–6 year-olds and 13 family interviews. Findings show that the children recognize the position of ‘the good child’ and most often prefer to take on this position, which is confirmed by their parents. The children can describe how ‘the good child’—in their eyes—should behave. They prefer consensus and not being embarrassing or embarrassed. The study concludes that the children are strongly immersed in social norms and family practices, and that the Danish national/cultural context probably reinforces these children as independent consumers, who are well aware of the requirements of the consumer role.

This paper aims to explore the opportunity recognition process and international new venture emergence in the context of university high-technology spin-offs that are internationally market driven from inception. University spin-offs (USOs) are defined as ‘new firms created to exploit commercially some knowledge, technology or research results developed within a university’ (Pirnay et al., Small Bus Econ 21:355–369, 2003). To address this inquiry, this study imports theory from the entrepreneurship literature on organizational emergence, opportunity recognition, effectuation and the principle of individual self-efficacy. Drawing on empirical case data from four case USOs from Denmark and Ireland, this paper finds that the inventor-founders are typically engaged in opportunity recognition processes that are characterized as creative, driven by scientific innovations. It is indicated that the process of USO emergence and continuous development involves activities and interactions similar to typical international new ventures. The scientific knowledge that created opportunities for the emergence of INV-USOs across our cases endorses the view that innovation and internationalization are strongly correlated. Insights are provided on inventor-founders’ entrepreneurial intention demonstrated through activities and interactions in the on-going processes of creating the USO. Findings further highlight that self-efficacy of the inventor-founder(s) and access to specific resources (means at hand) are salient determinants for international new ventures to materialize. The study concludes with a proposed conceptual framework for further research on the creation of INV-university spin-offs.

Thus, parents of low-performing students report their children to be friends of high-performing students. Our numerical simulations indicate that when this bias is combined with a bias on how some children target friends, then there is a multiplier effect on the expected school achievement. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Bonacich centrality; Friendships; Homophily; Parents’ bias; Peer effects; Primary school; Social networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977278622

Better targeting and stakeholder support should improve their effectiveness. The research aims to identify whether a target group (the group impacted by the policy measure) is characterised by higher acceptance levels or not. Acceptance among citizens from the target was compared to a matching non-target group, based on data from an online survey on citizens’ support of healthy eating policies conducted among 3003 adult respondents from five European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Poland, UK). The policies explored were bans of advertising to children or school vending machines, school meal regulations, education campaigns at schools and workplaces, menu nutrition information and food labelling, price subsidies for healthy food, and accessibility measures for the elderly. It was found that target groups showed more support than others for four policies: parents were more supportive of vending machine bans in schools and workers eating out at lunch of education campaigns at workplaces, food labelling was more supported by those considering nutrition content in food purchase, and price subsidies for healthy food more supported by respondents in financial difficulties. However, parents were less supportive of school education campaigns, and the pattern of support through the target group differed by country. It is concluded that members of the target group tend to, but are not per se especially supportive of healthy eating policy measures concerning themselves or their children, and there are great country differences. Acceptance of policies should be surveyed per target group and country in advance of implementation. In the case of lack in acceptance, further exploration of the barriers should be conducted so that the benefit of the policy can be more effectively communicated, assuming that this increases stakeholder cooperation and favourable peer influence. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Acceptance; Healthy eating; Public policy; Social marketing; Target group",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976869662

We disentangle distinct dimensions of environmental dynamism—the direction, magnitude, and frequency of change—and identify how selection shapes adaptive responses to these dimensions. Our results show how frequent directional changes undermine the value of exploration and decisively shift performance advantages to inert organizations that restrict exploration. In contrast, increased environmental variance rewards exploration. Our results also show that, in dynamic environments, the best-performing organizations are generally more inert than less successful organizations. Managerial summary: Our research helps managers to understand under what business conditions investments into exploration and strategic flexibility are more likely to pay off. Dynamic business environments characterized by persistent trends and by large, infrequently occurring structural shocks reward strategic pursuit of temporary advantage. Thus, exploration and strategic flexibility are preferred strategies. In contrast, the challenge in frequently changing environments with fleeting opportunities is to identify and to focus on strategic actions whose payoffs on average are high, independent of environmental volatility. Low levels of exploration and long-term strategic focus are preferred strategies in these circumstances. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While many scholars have analyzed its main characteristics and developments, only a few have assessed it against a concept of justice. And those exceptional cases have only focused on distributive justice, proving unable to grasp the important ethical elements that Fair Trade integrates in its project. In reaction to this, this article intends to critically examine what the Fair Trade movement proposes to be ‘fair’ by resorting to the thought of the French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas. To accomplish this goal, a new understanding of his conception of justice is presented, one that seeks to overcome the limitations that the two most common interpretations in the literature suffer. The idea of Lévinas’ ‘dialectics of justice’ is used to discuss Fair Trade’s relation of alterity, its appropriation of the notion of ‘face’ and its commitment to and responsibility for marginalized producers and workers. This analysis shows that Fair Trade operates with what could be described as a fetishized understanding of Levinasian ethics that justifies a deeply unjust praxis. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Ethics; Face; Fair trade; Justice; Lévinas; Other",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925014000

However, many companies experience that although they facilitate a CSR strategy on corporate level, CSR is often not embedded in their business and/or integrated across their functions. If companies are to achieve the full business potential and performance impact of CSR, sustainability has to be operationalized, targeted and measured across the value chain through empowered employees and in alignment with the business strategy of the company. Though state-of-the-art CSR research, theories and models, the theoretical platform for sustainable business and CSR is presented in this book. However, CSR is carried out in practice, and not just in theory. This is why each chapter is supplemented with practical case examples explaining the way in which different companies and their managers have integrated sustainable business in their strategy and across the organizations' different functions. As is evident both in theory and practice, the success of CSR integration is highly affected by industrial context, as the unique characteristics of the industry have an impact on the key sustainability challenges and business opportunities of the specific company and industry. In support of this evidence, the book also reveals how CSR can be implemented across private and public organizations as well as small & medium sized entities (SMEs) Theoretical and empirical topics discussed in the book include: Defining sustainable business and CSR CSR strategy integration Stakeholder management Sustainable innovation, management and production Change management & change leadership Green business model innovation Responsible HRM and administration Cradle-to-cradle Green procurement Corporate social innovation Sustainable Communication and - Sales Business-NGO partnerships. © 2016 River Publishers.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Agro-industrial businesses often have easy access to agricultural and processing residues with which they may reduce costs and pollution by integrating their production with bioenergy production. In regions with unreliable power supply, on-site electricity generation is a means to secure stable production conditions. Furthermore, recycling of nutrients may help to reduce biomass suppliers' dependence on synthetic fertiliser. In this Environmental Sustainability Assessment (ESA) of fruit production in Ghana we compare two technology options for the production of mixed, fresh, tropical fruit, including cultivation, transport and processing. The option 'Present practice' presents data from a case study where production is characterised by soil loss and synthetic fertiliser dependence in cultivation and grid supply of electricity in processing. The option 'Biogas' is hypothetical and characterised by biogas and electricity production using farming and processing residues and by recycling of nutrients and carbon to soil. Cocoa shells are used as a co-substrate in the biogas production. Estimating the environmental impact of cocoa shell residues exposes the multifunctionality issue, continuously debated in ESA, particularly concerning bioenergy production. We compare the use of allocation of cocoa production impacts and system expansion that includes cocoa production as possible methods to manage multifunctionality of inputs. In assessments of residue-based production, we recommend using the latter method. Applying the system expansion method, we find that, in comparison with 'Present practice', the option 'Biogas' eliminates net soil carbon loss and reduces synthetic fertiliser, diesel and external electricity requirements at the expense of a relatively small increase in human labour input. The ESA includes the following indicators and shows that the 'Biogas' option is superior to 'Present practice' with regard to Cumulative Energy Demand (-39%), Cumulative fossil Energy Demand (-34%), Food Energy Return On energy Investment (+65%), Food Energy Return On fossil energy Investment (+53) and Global Warming Potential (-29%) and similar to 'Present practice' in terms of the Emergy Assessment indicators Unit Emergy Value, Global Renewability Fraction, and Local Supply Fraction. Discarding the system expansion method, the same conclusion applies even if the emergy indicators are more ambiguous. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Reverse logistics (RL) has been considered as a systematic approach for industries to improve their environmental impacts and to ensure sustainability in business. Industries are enthusiastic to adopt RL activities in their businesses, but they also face challenges such as insufficient knowledge and resources regarding RL implementation. Therefore, we seek to evaluate the critical success factors (CSFs) linked to the implementation of RL in manufacturing industries in India. In this work, a structural model is proposed by using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to evaluate the CSFs in RL adoption. The AHP methodology assists in establishing the priorities of the CSFs, while the DEMATEL approach categorizes the causal relationships among them. The findings of this work shows that the Global competitiveness main factor is highly prioritized, and thus, needs to be focused greatly in order to increase the effectiveness of RL adoption in business. The relative priority of the remaining main factors through AHP analysis is given as Regulatory factors - HR and organizational factors -Economic factors - Strategic factors. The findings also indicate that Global competitiveness; Regulatory; HR and organizational main factors are classified under cause group, while Economic and Strategic main factors belong to effect group. This model will help business analysts and supply chain managers formulate both short-term and long-term, flexible decision strategies for successfully managing and implementing RL adoption in the supply chain scenarios. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to achieve this objective, this paper combines educational psychology with perspectives from entrepreneurship education research to make explicit educators tacit assumptions in order to understand how these assumptions guide teaching. Design/methodology/approach: – Using ethnographic analysis, the paper reports data from the continuous development and implementation of a single course over a period of ten years bringing in the educator’s and the students perspectives on their achievements and course content. Findings: – The authors find that it is sometimes advantageous to invoke and combine different learning theories and approaches in order to promote entrepreneurial awareness and mindset. It is also necessary to move away from entrepreneurship education as being teacher led to being more student-centred and focused on experiential and existential lifelong learning practices. Practical implications: – Practically, the authors make suggestions for the design and delivery of a course that demonstrates how four diverse learning theories can be combined to consolidate entrepreneurial learning in students invoking experiential and curiosity-based learning strategies. Originality/value: – There are very few examples of concrete course designs that have been researched longitudinally in-depth using ethnographic methods. Moreover, most courses focus on the post-foundation period, whereas this paper presents a course that is a primer to the entrepreneurial process and exclusively centred on the pre-foundation phase. Rather than building on a single perspective, it combines a range of theories and approaches to create interplay and progression. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship education; Pedagogy; Psychology; Student-centered; Teacher-led",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979916827

In doing so, the paper addresses uncontested values and beliefs that form a hidden curriculum prevalent in EE.

The revisit shows that the plain conclusions have not changed considerably. Next, the article examines the question of staff at Danish art museums. This indicates a majority of female agents. Last, the article argues that a declared parity in acquisition policy simplifies questions on gender and diversity.

Firstly, we seek to demonstrate the relevance of voice and silence-that is, whether employees contribute or withhold information, ideas, views and/or concerns at work-for the sustainable development of individuals, organizations and societies. Our second objective is to identify emerging (and enduring) issues-conceptual, theoretical and methodological-that have not yet been adequately addressed in voice and silence research. These issues include the relationship between voice and silence, how they may manifest in organizations, their manifold antecedents inside and beyond organizational boundaries, their potentially positive and negative effects for internal and external stakeholders, and methodological questions. The third objective is to propose opportunities for addressing these issues with the ultimate aim to build a broader and more integrative approach to the nature of silence and voice and their antecedents and consequences. These opportunities include a multi-level model specifying elements and processes leading to individual and collective voice and silence, approaches to voice and silence that have received little attention in organizational research so far, and methodological developments that might reveal new facets of voice and silence. Based on these elaborations, we derive avenues for practitioners who are concerned with promoting voice and preventing/ overcoming silence in organizations. © The Author(s) 2016.","Employee participation; Human resource management; Organizational behaviour; Silence; Voice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037032468

The paper describes how this extraordinary expansion was possible by showing how nation branding presents itself as a theoretical possibility and a practical necessity. We propose that what made a travel possible from product branding via corporate branding to nation branding was the semantic flexibility of the brand concept. We argue that the brand concept is almost void of meaning and that this feature has been an indispensable requisite for establishing nation branding as a field of practice and as an academic field. Despite the indisputable academic productivity that is a result of the vagueness of the brand concept, we suggest that to reach a normal science-like situation in the field of nation branding a clarification and systematization of central concepts is needed. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","brand concept; Nation branding; Scandinavian Institutionalism; theory & practice",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026364261

This study examines the politics of nation branding in relation to its configuration with public diplomacy and the institutional policy context in which they are embedded. Informed by Scandinavian institutionalism and the analytical concept of translation, the study reveals that the way that nation branding relates to public diplomacy within an institutional context sets the frame for its politicisation. Translation enables the understanding of nation branding as a dynamic process of becoming that unfolds in relation to time and place. The research contributes to a more nuanced view on nation branding in presenting its toolbox practices as less determined by a corporate marketing logic.

The purpose of this paper is to present five articles that explore and examine some of the complexities of equality and DM in various countries around the world. Design/methodology/approach - In this introductory paper, the authors provide an overview and the current state of literature on comparative research on equality and diversity. The authors also gathered a list of indices that is helpful as secondary data for informing comparative and crossnational research in this domain. Findings - To date, comparative work involving two or more countries is scarce with Canada/USA comparisons first appearing in the 1990s, followed by other groupings of countries a decade later. Existing comparative work has started to uncover the dialectics of voluntary and mandated action: both complement each other, although the order in which they appear vary from context to context. This work also acknowledges that there are varying degrees of intensity in the way that legislations may constrain employer action in encouraging a more diverse workforce, and that there is more than a binary choice between blind equality of rights (identity blind) and quota-based policies (affirmative action) available to decision makers. Originality/value - The comparative nature of these papers allows the reader to compare and contrast the different approaches to the adoption and implementation of DM. The authors also draw attention to several areas in cross-cultural DM research that have been understudied and deserve attention. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Comparative study; Cross-cultural management; Diversity management; Equality diversity and inclusion; Transnationalism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84996517885

We find that despite good intentions, as well as support from the top management, the project dissolves through micropolitics and power dynamics. We contribute to the critical literature on workforce diversity by identifying how organizational contextual dynamics influence the way the concept of workforce diversity is constructed and understood at work.

It addresses the question: How can practitioners' use of generalisations be understood, with a view towards producing research-based generalisations that facilitate use in practice? Design/methodology/approach - Language games are used to explore generalisation in practice, and the framework of pragmatic constructivism is adopted to characterise the generation of practice generalisation. Findings - Practice is conceptualised as a complex set of clusters of organised actions run by a set of applied generalisations and driven by human intentions. Practice also encompasses reflective activities that aim to create the generalisations and reflect them into the specific circumstances to create functioning practice. Generalisations depend on underlying concepts. The formation and structure of concepts is explored and used to create the construction and use of different types of generalisation. Generalisations function as cognitive building blocks in constructing strings of interconnected functioning activities. Managers make their own functioning generalisations that, however, do not satisfy the research criteria for acceptable generalisations. The research/practice gap is shaped by the very different language games played. Research limitations/implications - If research is to be useful to practice, the generalisations produced must methodologically articulate the types of generalisation that pervade the methods with which practitioners construct functioning activities. Further research has to give more insight into such processes.

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on pragmatic constructivism and Heron's (1992) theory of learning and personhood, the framework provides a methodology for tracing the way management accountants can construct themselves as reflective practitioners by enactig epistemic practices (Cetina, 2001). Furthermore, we enquire into the epistemological requirements for creating trustworthy knowledge and the processes through which actors can diminish the proactive-pragmatic truth gap. Findings - The framework shows how the participatory function of the mind, deeply rooted in affective processes, is implicated in creating empathic engagement with epistemic objects. Besides the affective dimension, there is the need for logical inferences to link facts and reveal possibilities for helping actors to pursue their value system. Coupling affective and logical processes fosters passionate humility, which helps actors create clear communicative acts with whom other actors can resonate, leading to the development of functioning practices. Research limitations/implications - Providing a framework for tracing the micro-processes of epistemic practices can serve as a tool for researchers to acquire a more detailed account of the practice and. By looking into the epistemological aspect of practice, researchers could be able to go beyond describing practice and suggest improvements from a pragmatic point of view. Originality/value - The paper provides a novel insight into the analysis of management accounting practice by showing the interplay between affective and cognitive processes in sustaining epistemic practice.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology used in this paper is first a literature review followed by research done with ethnographic methods such as participant observations, interviews and document analysis. Findings - Based on a literature review and research in water companies motivation and maturity based on Crowther (2006) and Crowther and Reis (2011) CSR maturity typology, the paper suggests an extension of this into a CSR Maturity Framework by adding profit-making, legitimacy and business ethics as clusters of motives for businesses to engage in CSR work. The concrete findings of the water sector suggest it as semi-mature according to the proposed CSR Maturity Framework, because it has only reached the level of CSR reporting, but neither suggests definitions of sustainability nor shows any particularly good transparency and accountability yet. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to water companies in four regions - Denmark, the UK, the USA and South Africa - which means that such companies in other regions may differ from the findings in this paper.

Drawing upon methodological insights provided by genealogical studies of accounting and anthropological studies of “things,” this research addresses the activities and transformations that take place to move the survey from war to ward—from a means of learning about medical populations during and immediately after World War II to a means of accounting for the views of consumers and of holding providers accountable for their care. These movements are shown to entail the staging and stabilizing of “knowing patients” in both senses of the term: these are patients that are equipped and empowered as consumers with knowledge about quality and their care, and simultaneously stripped of their individualizing characteristics so as to be made knowable to organizations in terms that can be managed and improved. These findings speak to the limitations of accounting as it infiltrates fluid and personal spaces in order to represent people in modes other than financial and to reconstitute knowledge from below. Doing so is shown not just to limit the possibilities for customers to speak and to be heard, but to give rise to a particularly pernicious form of territorialization in which the subject and object of accounting knowledge become inextricably intertwined and indistinguishably blurred. This has implications for the promises and practices of accounting in a post-modern society and for the kinds of questions that researchers ask about its effects. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting change; Customer; Healthcare; Quality improvement; Survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981722719

Design/methodology/approach – A review of previous studies on the effects of globalisation on corporate communication and the implications of language management initiatives in international business. Findings – Efficient language management can turn language into a strategic resource. Language needs analyses, i.e. linguistic auditing/language check-ups, can be used to determine the language situation of a company. Language policies and/or strategies can be used to regulate a company’s internal modes of communication. Language management tools can be deployed to address existing and expected language needs.

Thus, the concern is with the relationship between institutionalized strategic management and the real-life strategic communication processes, thus advancing the understanding of the role of texts and discourses in the actual practice of strategic communication in an organizational context of strategic change processes. Design/methodology/approach – The data are based on a large corpus of video-taped management meetings and organization-wide meetings in a large Danish public, knowledge-based organization. The method applied for studying the management discourse is a conversation-analytical approach (Sacks et al., 1974; Sidnell, 2010). This method has been chosen as it enables the authors to focus on micro-aspects of organizational practices (Nicolini, 2013) by investigating the interactional patterns that serve as resources for doing legitimation as an institutionalized practice. Findings – The common denominator for the entire analysis is legitimation accomplished through the discursive use of distanciation and the analysis identifies three different discursive elements or micro-level strategies directly related to the concrete doing of strategic communication. First, legitimation is created by reference to the socio-economic context of the organization. Second, legitimation is generated by means of pointing to the abnormality of the strategic situation. And third legitimation is fostered by the use of idiomatic expressions. These different ways of accomplishing legitimacy are in a strategy-as-practice perspective related to the specific, in-situ communicative praxis and accomplished by the concrete actions of the strategic communicators, and thus the authors can position the instances of strategic communication at the organizational micro-level. Originality/value – This paper studies at a micro-level how strategic actors use various discursive resources to legitimize strategic decisions and how these resources constitute the discursive basis of strategic communication as a managerial practice. The authors focus on the role of discourse in the legitimization processes of strategic managerial decisions analyzing micro-level instances of organizational communication. The paper thereby links the actor process activities (Langley, 2007), e.g. organization-wide meetings at the micro-level, to the institutional field practices at the macro-level within an organization, e.g. strategy and planning (Johnson et al., 2007). © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Discourse; Legitimation; Micro-level analysis; Strategic change; Strategic communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978917063

In fact, we find that schooling only pays off in combination with wage-work experience, as the returns to schooling are insignificant when the entrepreneur has no wage-work experience. The results are extremely robust toward more flexible specifications, including fixed-effect estimations dealing with unobserved heterogeneity.

This article examines consumer decisions whether or not to share video advertisements, in particular the role of their moment-to-moment likeability of the online ad. The study uses a theoretical memory-based framework of temporal sequence effects and unique data for 120 advertisements and more than 43,000 consumer evaluations. The authors find that high likeability at the beginning and the end of a video advertisement is important, though consistent with the memory-based framework, the ending effect is greater. A linear trend in likeability does not influence viral potential, but variance in likeability evaluations (the rollercoaster effect) has positive effects on an advertisement's virality. The moment-to-moment effects are mediated by the overall liking for an online video advertisement. Interestingly, the beginning, end and peak effects influence the viral potential even after controlling for the overall liking. The difference of the peak moment becomes important only when controlling for the overall liking, whereas the direct peak and the rollercoaster effects are suppressed by the overall liking. © 2015 Marketing EDGE.org.","Content sharing; Moment-to-moment evaluations; Online advertising; Viral marketing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962359541

The latter often see social enterprise as a simple phenomenon that can be arranged along a continuum, ranging from economic to social, where more of one means less of the other. However, this fails to acknowledge the multi-disciplinary nature of social enterprise.

This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by enhancing our understanding of how the innovation capability of vendors is deployed to win, run and renew outsourcing contracts with their customers. Employing the resource-based view as a theoretical basis and undertaking in-depth case study analysis of three vendors in the electronic manufacturing services industry, the research shows that to achieve the outsourcing objectives of winning, running and renewing the contract, vendors can use different configurations of the competitive priorities of cost, quality, delivery and flexibility. The research aggregates the capabilities that influence the innovative capability of a vendor into the innovation-related capabilities (IRCs) of design, new product introduction and manufacturing. Three strategies are identified for vendors on how to deploy these IRCs, and a number of propositions are developed to indicate the suitability of the three deployment strategies for different operational contexts. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Capabilities; competitive priorities; delivery, innovation, new product introduction and outsourcing","Electronics industry; Industrial research; Outsourcing; Product design; Capabilities; Competitive priorities; Electronic manufacturing services; Electronics manufacturing industry; Innovation capability; Innovative capability; New product introductions; Resource-based view; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958060571

This calls for additional flexibility of the power market. With the right coupling to the underlying national and local district heating (DH) markets, large shares of flexibility can be generated. However, regulatory barriers and different energy taxes may hinder the potential benefits from systems integration and lower the realisable potentials. By a case study for Denmark we survey and discuss regulatory barriers and drivers for flexibility obtained from DH. We reveal that the choice of technologies for heat generation is mainly driven by outdated policies and tax conditions that create barriers for additional flexibility in the overall energy system. However, the balancing markets may be a main driver for introducing more electric boilers into DH and thereby increase its contribution to flexibility. © 2016 IEEE.","Energy; Power generation economics; Renewable energy sources; Wind energy; Wind energy integration","Commerce; Flexible couplings; Natural resources; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Wind power; Additional flexibilities; Energy; Power generation economics; Regulatory barriers; Renewable energy source; Systems integration; Variable renewable energies; Wind energy integration; District heating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983371654

Due to continuous growth, energy demand has increased. Solutions have been proposed in order to satisfy the increase in demand, often implying the increase of capacity of the power mix. Meanwhile, current issues concerning climate change and fossil fuels depletion has moved attention towards cleaner ways to produce energy. This trend facilitated the breakthrough of renewable technologies. Since then, support policies have promoted the large deployment of renewables, without considering enough the improvements made in the energy saving field. Indeed, little attention has been paid to implement energy efficiency measures, which has resulted in scenarios where expedients for a wise use of energy (e.g. energy savings and renewables share) are unbalanced. The aim of this paper is to review and evaluate international experiences on finding the optimal trade-off between efficiency improvements and additional renewable energy supply. A critical review of each technique, focusing on purposes, methodology and outcomes, is provided along with a review of tools adopted for the analyses. The models are categorized and presented according to their main characteristics (e.g. bottom-up/top-down model, regional/national analysis, partial/general equilibrium, static/dynamic model).

Many alternative offering strategies based on forecasts in various forms are available in the literature. However, they assume some form of knowledge of future market state and potential balancing prices. In contrast here, we explore whether algorithms could readily learn from market data and deduce how to offer strategically in order to maximize expected market revenues.

EMTs learn to consider them part of the job as they become technically and emotionally trained to tackle traumatic situations. Additionally, and contrary to lay people, EMTs have immediate professional tasks to do at emergency sites (Mannon, 1992: 180-192; Palmer, 1983). The instrumental engulfment in emergency situations creates an emotional shield; they usually neither have time nor energy to focus on the human tragedy surrounding them (Mannon, 1981). Moreover, informal evaluations and ‘sensemaking’ between colleagues take place all the time (Weick, 1995). These informal discussions serve as proactive ‘emotional repair work’ by processing and debriefing potentially nagging feelings of responsibility, helplessness, guilt, etc., which are always latent for human service workers with responsibility for other people’s lives and health. It is exactly such important but informal mundane ‘emotional repair work’ that helps EMTs to deal with life-and-death situations on a daily basis without burning out emotionally and becoming ‘second victims’ (Dekker, 2013). From time to time, however, episodes do take an emotional toll on EMTs (Metz, 1981: 105ff). 3. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Mathias Ericson and Ulf Mellström; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062931408

However, this stands in stark contrast to the historically embedded image of the municipality. In this chapter the intended image of the municipality is compared to the image as it is perceived by newcomers. The study shows that historically embedded images of places are hard to manage and change when they involve elements with negative appeal towards a specific target audience e.g. entrepreneurs. The branding problem for the municipality is shown to be the conflict between the brands of history, entrepreneurial spirit, family friendly town, and tourism etc. To manage a place brand so diverse is almost impossible and it is clearly demonstrated that the solution has been to brand the place as everything for everybody. © 2017, by IGI Global.

In this study, life cycle assessment was used to compare impact potentials of slurry acidification at either the pig housing or the field application stage with conventional slurry management. Furthermore, the effects of differences in environmental regulations concerning nitrogen application limits were analysed. The impact categories analysed were terrestrial eutrophication potential, climate change potential, marine eutrophication potential and toxicity potential. Slurry acidification reduced the terrestrial eutrophication potential by 71% for in-house acidification and by 30% for field acidification. Changes in regulatory plant-available nitrogen application limits resulted in changes in climate change potential and marine eutrophication potential, with lower limits favouring in-house acidification. Acidification can substantially reduce the environmental impacts of animal slurry, but the effect depends on the context of the regulatory regime. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Acidification; Life cycle assessment; Manure management; Pig; Slurry treatment; Swine","Acidification; Agriculture; Climate change; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Nitrogen; Climate change potentials; Eutrophication potentials; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Manure management; Plant available nitrogens; Slurry treatment; Swine; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992296728

This study investigated if unutilized biomasses are able to support an efficient biomethanation process with low carbon footprint, in these rural areas where low-tech reactors have been abandoned. Thus, the aims of this study were: a) to identify and evaluate alternative biomasses as anaerobic digestion substrates at a remote rural area site in India; b) to propose an efficient continuous biomethanation scenario for low-tech reactors; c) to assess the influence of the operational parameters on the stability of the anaerobic digestion process. The highest methane yield (137–159 NmL CH4 L−1) and co-digestion synergy (&gt;20% more CH4 than expected) were achieved by co-digestion of wastewater, cow manure, banana and rice by-products at 79.3/4.2/16.3/0.2 ww−1 VS ratio, respectively. Three fixed-dome reactors, R30, R45 and R60, fed with all substrates, operated with hydraulic retention times of 30, 45, and 60 days and organic loading rates of 2.18, 1.46, and 1.09 g VS L−1 d−1, respectively (different co-digestion scenarios). R60 was the best continuous co-digestion scenario with 45% and 13% higher energy recovery from biomasses' utilization and 69% and 25% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, compared to R30 and R45, respectively.

We found that, in comparison with students from the Kikuyu tribe, students from the Luhya and Luo tribes are less likely to have intentions becoming nascent entrepreneurs.

Departing from dialogical, emergent and processual perspectives on ""organization,"" the individual chapters focus on the character of counter-narratives, along with their performative aspects, by addressing questions such as: how do some narratives gain dominance over others? how do narratives intersect, relate and reinforce each other how are organizational members and external stakeholders engaged in the telling and re-telling of the organization? The empirical case studies provide much needed insights on the function of counter-narratives for individuals, professionals and organizations in navigating, challenging, negotiating and replacing established dominant narratives about ""who we are,"" ""what we believe,"" ""what we do"" as a collective. The book has an interdisciplinary scope, drawing together ideas from both storytelling in organization studies, the communicative constitution of organization (CCO) from organizational communication, and traditional narratology from humanities.

Design/methodology/approach – Building on ethnographic fieldwork conducted on Samsø in 2013 and 2014, the paper takes as its starting point a citizens’ meeting in which a new renewable energy project is proposed by a municipal coordinator. This meeting, in which the municipal coordinator exhibits a “change management” attitude, fails to win the citizens’ support and becomes an entry point into an investigation of how the REI project developers managed to get the island community to actively support the project. A gateway to the past, the meeting allows the author to ethnographically describe the unobserved events of 1997-2007. Findings – The argument is that the REI project developers practised management through hope or “hope management”, in contrast to “change management”, creating a project that succeeded in accomplishing its goals of changing the island due to its openness, its rootedness in the island community’s past, and the project developers’ ability to speak to a down-to-earth variety of hope. Originality/value – The paper makes use of an ethnographic study of the present to investigate an unobserved past in which a REI was built. Taking up the “hope debate” in anthropology and Science and Technology Studies (Stengers, 2002; Miyazaki, 2004; Jensen, 2014), the paper contributes with an empirical analysis of the role of hope in the management of change processes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Climate change; Ethnography; Hope; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981505095

To make proper assessments of different sludge treatments, it is crucial to have reliable estimates of emissions after the application of different sludge types. However, because of the complexity of the agricultural production system, it is difficult to estimate emissions consistently under different conditions. In the current paper, a mechanistic agro-ecosystem model was calibrated to be able to simulate different sludge types stabilized using different techniques. Subsequently, 100 year model simulations were used to provide emission factors as well as harvest and carbon sequestration factors (collectively called environmental inventory factors) under a variety of environmental conditions. Environmental inventory factors were calculated under both high crop response conditions (i.e. when nitrogen was limiting) and low crop response conditions (i.e. when nitrogen was not limiting). The average high response nitrogen harvest factor over the tested environmental conditions was ranging from 0.06 to 0.30 for the different sludge types included. This means that if an additional 1 kg of nitrogen is applied with sludge, between 0.06 and 0.30 kg additional nitrogen is harvested. This is considerably lower than for mineral fertilizer with an average value of 0.63. The low response harvest factors were considerably lower, ranging from 0.03 to 0.13. The emission factor for nitrous oxide nitrogen was ranging from 0.024 to 0.034, consistently being higher under high response conditions. For nitrogen leaching to the groundwater, the high response emission factor ranged from 0.20 to 0.50 for the different sludge types while the low response were slightly higher ranging from 0.18 to 0.55. The average carbon sequestration factor across the different environmental conditions ranged from 0.03 to 0.05 for the different sludge types. In conclusion, the approach using an agro-ecosystem model to estimate inventory factors associated with land application of sludge under varying conditions proved very powerful and would have been virtually impossible by experimental means. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Biosolids; Carbon sequestration; Daisy; Emission factor; Nitrogen leaching; Nitrous oxide","Agriculture; Biosolids; Crops; Ecology; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Harvesting; Leaching; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Sewage sludge; Carbon sequestration; Daisy; Emission factors; Nitrogen leaching; Nitrous oxide; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981763318

This is especially important as the wind power industry continues to grow, both in volume and size, in response to increasing global market demands. Planning, implementing, monitoring, documenting and communicating product related environmental activities of wind turbines in a life cycle management context is the focal point of this article. The development and application of an ecodesign framework specific to the organizational context of Siemens Wind Power is described. The framework was developed using an iterative, action research design approach which relied on the participation of cross-functional employees. Five iterations occurred over a four year time frame and methods such as workshops, pilots, interviews and life cycle assessment were applied. The ecodesign framework was aligned with the company's formal product lifecycle management process. When combined with life cycle assessment, the framework can identify potential environmental improvements and contribute to coherent and transparent environmental target setting. Examples of this are demonstrated at the technological, organizational and societal levels of the company.

Regional disparity brings difficulties and uncertainties to policy implementation in China. Therefore, an investigation on the regional features of industrial emissions is critical to better decision makings. While to date, related studies have been rather few. This paper applies a spatial analysis on regional features of China's industrial emissions (SO2, NOx and PM2.5 and CO2 emission) in 31 provinces. Spatial autocorrelation and regression analysis are firstly conducted to identify the regional emissions patterns. The regional disparity and inequity is further analyzed with Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient approach. Analytical results verify the regional cluster effects and the emissions' sensitivity to the economic and industrial development, and highlight not only disparity, but also inequity exists. It is concluded that, there is a larger unequal distribution of GDP per unit of air pollutants and CO2 emission between eastern and western regions, reveals that less developed western and central regions suffer from the emission leakage and an environmental inequity. Regional oriented mitigation strategies are required to balance regional disparity, so as to realize the industrial emission control policy under the ""equity and efficiency"" principle. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Gini coefficient; Industrial emissions; Lorenz curve; Regional disparity; Spatial analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decision making; Emission control; Planning; Public policy; Regression analysis; Spatial variables measurement; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; China; Gini coefficients; Lorenz curves; Regional disparities; Spatial analysis; Industrial emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979468251

Considering the case of aluminum cans, the objectives of this paper are twofold: (i) to compare the environmental impact associated with different levels of two C2C certification requirements by using LCA; and (ii) to identify the main challenges and drawbacks in the combined use of LCA and C2C for packaging within the circular economy framework. Twenty different scenarios were developed and compared, according to three C2C certification levels, in terms of % renewable energy and % recycled content. The results show that increasing the recycled content provides more improvements to environmental impacts than increasing renewable energy usage. Furthermore, receiving a higher certification level does not necessarily mean environmental burden reduction in LCA sense. From a methodological point of view, the main challenge for LCA is to address the continuous loop of materials and account for the benefits from recycling in a consistent way. Meanwhile for C2C the challenge is to guarantee a proper translation of the C2C principles into the C2C certification program, avoiding burden shifting and to find a balance between the different certification requirements. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Circular economy; Cradle to Cradle; LCA; Packaging; Recycling; Scenario analysis","Aluminum; Environmental impact; Packaging; Program translators; Recycling; Certification programs; Certification requirements; Circular economy; Cradle to cradles; Environmental burdens; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renewable energies; Scenario analysis; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979463226

This is unfortunate as a firm’s marketing activities may also mobilise WOM, which then can leverage the activities’ effect on consumer responses. The present study fills this research gap and investigates how WOM mediates the relationship between the 4Ps and consumer responses using the Partial Least Squares method on survey data with 400 broadband customers. Findings show that the 4Ps influence consumer responses directly and that this effect is leveraged when WOM mediates the relationship. The 4Ps primarily mobilise positive WOM (PWOM), making PWOM the strongest mediator. This has implications for marketing and communication strategies, as the 4Ps have to mobilise WOM and influence consumer responses directly. This challenges the composition of the 4Ps and how to design the marketing message so it is appealing for consumers to bring into their social milieu so WOM can take place. It also underlines the necessity to add PWOM as a fifth P, so the different marketing activities’ effect can be amplified by the power of WOM and brands can be created as much out of PWOM as out of marketing activities. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","brand attitude; marketing activities; mediation; purchase intention; structural equation model; survey; word of mouth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969804446

The process repeatedly revisits the criteria and sourcing decision as the development process continues. This enables a structured adoption of product and production system innovation from strategic suppliers, where previously the literature purely focuses on product innovation or cost reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted an embedded researcher style, inductive, qualitative case study of an industrial supply cluster comprising a focal automotive company and its interaction with three different strategic stamping suppliers. Findings: Our contribution is the multi-phased production and product innovation process. This is an advance from traditional supplier selection and also an extension of ideas of supplier-located product development as it includes production system development, and complements the literature on working with strategic suppliers. Specifically, we explicitly articulate the previously unreported issue of whether a supplier chosen for its innovation capabilities at the start of the new product development process will also be the most appropriate supplier during the production system development phase, when an ability to work collaboratively may be the most important attribute, or in the large-scale production phase when an ability to manufacture at low unit cost may be most important. Originality/value: The paper identifies a multi-phase approach to tendering within a fixed body of strategic suppliers which seeks to identify the optimum technological and process decisions as well as the traditional supplier sourcing choice. These areas have not been combined before and generate a valuable approach for firms to adopt as well as for researchers to extend our understanding of a highly complex process. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","decision process; innovation; production system; Supplier selection","Cost reduction; Product development; Decision process; Design/methodology/approach; New product development process; Product innovation process; Production system; Production system development; Qualitative case studies; Supplier selection; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963593331

This paper, however, studies the possibility of using discounts in situations when total demand is non-sensitive to changes in prices. By introducing a discount in some periods, the supplier is able to give his customers the incentive to change their order patterns in a way that minimises his total cost. With the new order schemes, all parties are at least as well off as before. A mono-objective reformulation for this conflicting bi-objective problem is proposed and a mixed-integer-based heuristic is developed for the reformulated problem. The heuristic algorithm is based on a separation between determining the order/set-up pattern and the required discounts. Extensive numerical studies show that the application of the heuristic results in a benefit for the whole supply chain. To increase the supplier's profit, a modification of the heuristic which differs in the discount approximation used is developed. © 2015, © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Discounts; dynamic lot-sizing; heuristics; mixed-integer programming; supplier's profit maximisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045628583

Yet, most scholars readily agree that some form of authenticity is essential to the level of satisfaction experienced by tourists. Through its focus on representations and perceptions of “authenticity” at heritage tourism sites, this article argues that it makes sense to speak of authenticities (in the plural), rather than authenticity (in the singular), and proposes a semiotics-based typology for the purpose – including a new definition of “symbolic authenticity”. Finally, through practical application to two sites: Nottingham Castle and the Hans Egede monument in Nuuk's Colonial Harbour, the article illustrates how such a typology of authenticities might be a valuable tool to destination developers and marketers, city planners, site managers and interpreters as they seek to address different heritage tourist segments. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","authenticity; heritage tourism; Nottingham; Nuuk; semiotics","heritage tourism; historic building; tourism economics; tourism management; tourism market; tourist destination; Arctic; England; Greenland; Nottingham [England]; Nottingham [Nottingham (ADS)]; Nuuk; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945236921

Diversity is theorized as a double-edged sword for organizations, generating greater innovation, creativity, and performance, but also conflict. We propose that leaders will be motivated to use performance data to understand, manage, and explain the effects of diversity. To study this question, we employ a randomized controlled field experiment where organizations are assigned new employees that bring role and educational diversity. We find that leaders are more responsive to these two types of functional diversity when they view their organization as lacking an innovative organizational culture. © The Author 2016.

To test this proposition, the impact of a carbon footprint label on Danish consumers' choice of ground coffee was tested in a 3 price levels × 3 levels of carbon emission × 3 certifying organizations × 2 organic labeling conditions discrete choice experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to two slightly different variants of the experiment: In one condition, participants saw the original Carbon Trust label and in the other condition they saw the same label, but with traffic light colors added to communicate the product's relative performance in terms of carbon footprint. All included attributes were found to have a significant impact on consumer choices. As expected, price and carbon footprint were negatively related to choice. Further, participants preferred organic to non-organic coffee and certification by a public authority. The effect of the carbon label is significantly stronger the more environmentally concerned the consumer is. Using colors to indicate relative carbon footprint significantly increases carbon label effectiveness. Hence, a carbon footprint label is more effective if it uses traffic light colors to communicate the product's relative performance. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our findings suggest that disclosing the assurance level has a significantly positive impact. In contrast, we cannot demonstrate a material effect of expanding the audit report to include the materiality level or KAM.

On the one hand, such experiences are performed to an extent where it is difficult to isolate the sites and movements experienced per se, since visitors and travellers take part in 'doing' places and mobility. On the other, experience sites and routes stand out with specific traces and characteristics affording some - and not other - experiences. This article discusses conceptual understandings that may help to better analyse what it takes to perform tourist sites. Following a discussion of Walter Benjamin's way of understanding experiences as Erlebnisse, I suggest that ideas about multiplicity and absence-presence in Actor-Network Theory can develop new insights into how place and mobility are experienced in several layers of reality. To better understand experiences taking place in intersections between realities, J.R.R. Tolkien's concept of how real enchantment produces a Secondary World suggests that we see fantasy as real, and this proposition is compared to Georg Simmel's more modernist suggestion that experiences (Erlebnisse) are practised as living adventures, where intersecting worlds are not apart from each other. These practices are performed in restless mobilities among places, where the connections and hints between place and mobility are central in making absence-presence tensions produce experiences. Finally, the article discusses how the analysis of experience is related to the professional, experimental work of building a tourist attraction, exemplified by the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde. © SAGE Publications.","Absence; enchantment; experience; mobility; place; tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977151004

The one-item general red tape scale is representative of this approach. However, scholars have called for improved measures that address the scale's shortcomings. This article introduces a new measurement scale that features (1) red tape as a two-dimensional construct that includes compliance burden and lack of functionality and (2) a job-centered approach that measures red tape as experienced by employees in their jobs rather than more generally in the organization. A set of survey questions derived from interviews with government employees was validated using data from 1,203 government employees. The findings indicate that the two-dimensional job-centered red tape scale is reliable and valid. The authors conclude that this measure can improve research and be used by managers for a “quick scan” to detect the location and severity of red tape. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974530221

The globalization-based acculturation process in the North Indian region of Ladakh appears to be a tricultural encounter, suggesting an addendum to the bidimensional acculturation model for this group (and perhaps for others as well). This study explores the development, usability, and validity of a tridimensional acculturation measure aiming to capture the multicultural orientations initiated by the process of globalization in Ladakh.

Solution approaches have been proposed for different planning phases: strategic, tactical, operational, and real-time planning. In this paper we compare two approaches within the operational and real-time planning phase. The first exact approach is based on a known Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) which is solved using CPLEX. The second approach is a new method that is an extension of a recently introduced MILP, which is solved using a column and row generation approach. In this paper, we benchmark the performance of the methods on networks of two countries (Denmark and The Netherlands). We use the approaches to make daily schedules and we test their real time applicability by performing tests with different disruption scenarios. The computational experiments demonstrate that both models can be used on both networks and are able to find optimal rolling stock circulations in the different planning phases. Furthermore, the results show that both approaches are sufficiently fast to be used in a real-time setting. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",,"comparative study; numerical model; planning system; public transport; railway transport; real time; transportation planning; Denmark; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962892274

We extend the kernel ridge regression methodology to enable its use for economic time series forecasting, by including lags of the dependent variable or other individual variables as predictors, as is typically desired in macroeconomic and financial applications.

The auction simplifies the procurement process by reducing the principal’s articulation of preferences to simply choosing the most preferred offer as if it was a market with posted prices. This is done simply by replacing the submitted sealed bids by yardstick bids, computed by a linear weighting of the other participants’ bids. We show that there is only one type of Nash equilibria where some agents may win the auction by submitting a zero price-bid. Using a simulation study we demonstrate that following this type of equilibrium behavior often leads to winner’s curse. The simulations show that in auctions with more than 12 participants the chance of facing winner’s curse is around 95 %. Truthful reporting, on the other hand, does not constitute a Nash equilibrium but it is ex post individually rational. Using a simulation study we demonstrate that truthful bidding may indeed represent some kind of focal point. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Articulation of preferences; Multi-attribute auctions; Yardstick competition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950267103

Deployment of the term was made by the United National (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the UN ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ Framework, which apply SLO as an argument for responsible business conduct, connecting to social expectations and bridging to public regulation. This UN guidance has had a significant bearing on how public regulators seek to influence business conduct beyond Human Rights to broader Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) concerns. Drawing on examples of such public regulatory governance, this article explores and explains developments towards a juridification of CSR entailing efforts by public regulators to reach beyond jurisdictional and territorial limitations of conventional public law to address adverse effects of transnational economic activity. Through analysis of an expansion of law into the normative framing of what constitutes responsible business conduct, we demonstrate a process of juridification entailing a legal framing of social expectations of companies, a proliferation of law into the field of business ethics, and an increased regulation by law of social actors or processes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CSR transparency and reporting; EU and CSR; Juridification of CSR; OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; Politicization of business; Social licence to operate; UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; UN ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ Framework",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946434405

The resulting Lagrangian subproblem usually can substantially be reduced in size. The method may thus be more efficient in finding an optimal solution to a mixed integer program than a “solver” applied to the initial MIP formulation, provided that “small” optimal multiplier values can be found in a few iterations. Recently, a simplification of the semi-Lagrangian relaxation scheme has been suggested in the literature. This “simplified” approach is actually to apply ordinary Lagrangian relaxation to a reformulated problem and still does not show a duality gap, but the Lagrangian dual reduces to a one-dimensional optimization problem. The expense of this simplification is, however, that the Lagrangian subproblem usually can not be reduced to the same extent as in the case of ordinary semi-Lagrangian relaxation. Hence, an effective method for optimizing the Lagrangian dual function is of utmost importance for obtaining a computational advantage from the simplified Lagrangian dual function. In this paper, we suggest a new dual ascent method for optimizing both the semi-Lagrangian dual function as well as its simplified form for the case of a generic discrete facility location problem and apply the method to the uncapacitated facility location problem. Our computational results show that the method generally only requires a very few iterations for computing optimal multipliers. Moreover, we give an interesting economic interpretation of the semi-Lagrangian multiplier(s). © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Facility location; Lagrangian relaxation; Mixed integer programming; Semi-Lagrangian relaxation; Uncapacitated facility location problem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945286200

Business schools have been deemed largely responsible for developing and teaching socially dysfunctional curricula that, if anything, has served to promote and accelerate the kind of ruthless behavior and lack of self-restraint and social irresponsibility among top executives that have been seen as causing the crisis. As a result, many calls have been made for business schools to accept their responsibilities as social institutions and to work toward becoming more socially embedded and better attuned to public interests. In this paper, however, we point to some of the barriers there may be in the way of business schools developing into responsible organizational citizens proper. We argue that there are lines of resistance against responsibilization operating at epistemological, institutional, and organization levels and that we need to take account of barriers on all these levels in order to properly capture the challenges that are involved in making the modern business school amenable to demands for more social responsibility. In terms of working toward overcoming such barriers, we discuss how business education can become more socially embedded via the inclusion of ethical reflection and critical thinking. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Business ethics; Business schools; Corporate social responsibility; Critical management education; Management education; Management paradigms; Right to operate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944627083

The purpose of this paper is to challenge understandings of innovations as defined by being value-adding per se. Whether the effects of attempting to innovate are positive or negative is in this paper regarded as a matter of empirical investigation. Design/methodology/approach – Narrative accounts of activities during the change initiative are analysed in order to elucidate the effects of framing the change initiative as innovation on which boundaries are created and crossed. Findings – Framing change initiatives as innovation leads to intended as well as unanticipated boundary crossings where healthcare practitioners from different organizations recognize a shared problem and task. It also leads to unintended boundary reinforcements between “us and them” that may exclude the perspectives of patients or stakeholders when confronting complex problems in healthcare. This boundary reinforcement can lead to further fragmentation of healthcare despite the stated intention to create more integrated services. Practical implications – The paper suggests that researchers as well as practitioners should not presume that intentions to innovate will by themselves enhance creativity and innovation. When analysing the intended, unintended as well as unanticipated consequences of framing change initiatives as innovation, researchers and practitioner gain nuanced knowledge about the effects of intending to innovate in complex settings such as healthcare. Originality/value – This paper suggests the need for an analytical move from studying the effects of innovation to studying the effects of framing complex problems as a call for innovation. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Boundary creation; Boundary crossing; Framing; Healthcare innovation; Unintended effects","case report; creativity; doctor patient relation; health care policy; human; narrative; organization; public hospital; reinforcement; scientist; Denmark; health care delivery; health services research; mass communication; qualitative research; Delivery of Health Care; Denmark; Diffusion of Innovation; Health Care Reform; Hospitals, Public; Organizational Case Studies; Qualitative Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975069879

Design/methodology/approach – In total, 24 GPs were interviewed, three practices were observed and documents were collected. The Gioia methodology was used to analyse data, drawing on a theoretical framework that integrate the sensemaking perspective and institutional theory. Findings – Most GPs, who actively consider discontinuation, are reluctant to discontinue medication, because the safest course of action for GPs is to continue prescriptions, rather than discontinue them. The authors conclude that this is in part due to the ambiguity about the appropriateness of discontinuing medication, experienced by the GPs, and in part because the clinical guidelines do not encourage discontinuation of medication, as they offer GPs a weak frame for discontinuation. Three reasons for this are identified: the guidelines provide dominating triggers for prescribing, they provide weak priming for discontinuation as an option, and they underscore a cognitive constraint against discontinuation. Originality/value – The analysis offers new insights about decision making when discontinuing medication. It also offers one of the first examinations of how the institutional context embedding GPs influences their decisions about discontinuation. For policymakers interested in the discontinuation of medication, the findings suggest that de-stigmatising discontinuation on an institutional level may be beneficial, allowing GPs to better justify discontinuation in light of the ambiguity they experience. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Deprescribing; Discontinuation; General practitioners; Institutional context; Medication","conceptual framework; consensus development; decision making; drawing; embedding; general practitioner; human; prescription; behavioral observation; general practitioner; interview; psychology; qualitative research; treatment withdrawal; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; Behavior Observation Techniques; Decision Making; General Practitioners; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Interviews as Topic; Qualitative Research; Withholding Treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975032523

It is an intervention into the debates on what is taught and how learning takes place, demonstrating both the potential and the limits of what the humanities and social sciences can do for management education.

Based on this outline, we establish the historical and systematic framework for an analysis of three selected reports on management education, which is subsequently presented in the manner of a recursive operation. Because the current debate shows an emerging consensus among business schools and other stakeholders of management education that the integration of the humanities and social sciences might be a productive and even necessary factor in the future of management education, the chapter as a whole aims at substantiating this consensus by applying humanities’ and social sciences’ narratological expertise to the arguments and hypotheses offered by those reports to showcase the potential of such integrational endeavours. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Chris Steyaert, Timon Beyes and Martin Parker.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104391533

Taking such an ambition seriously requires a proper dialogue between the different stakeholders in the field, that is an open debate about what business and management studies is or may become, which articulates the problems and dilemmas of this field from within the field itself. Engaging in such a process, business must not only learn from the humanities; the humanities must also learn from the logic of business studies. This means engaging with the emphatic focus on action and utility, which is a traditional hallmark of this sphere. It also requires acknowledging the immense practical importance of the forms of knowledge produced to the contemporary world. Developing education around the question of how to assume responsibility in a non-moralizing way may work to free the humanities from a twofold trap: first, the illusion that what humanities represent is the ideal description of the world; second, the unfortunate tendency to wallow in critical or deconstructive debunking that comes with this illusion, which often fails to take responsibility for how we should act and decide. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Chris Steyaert, Timon Beyes and Martin Parker.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095936083

We begin with a small empirical study undertaken by one of our students. It took place at a business university, in a course called “Cities and Creativity.” The course was dedicated to and constructed around short, quasi-ethnographic studies that the students conducted on the everyday constitution of urban spaces, the way such spaces afford certain kinds of emotions, perceptions, and practices and the way they are shaped by these emotions, perceptions, and practices in return. Our student took on the university campus itself. Among other things, his study assembled narratives of the campus’s atmospheric force based on interviews with and cognitive mappings by a local architect, a researcher, a janitor, a student, and an inhabitant of the city. In their accounts and maps, we found a variety of ways of affectively relating to the campus and its buildings. We learned that the architect was “thrilled” and “fascinated” by the style of the building, that the researcher experienced the campus as “dull” and “boring, "" that the janitor found the campus a “tense” and “strange” place, that the student “detested” the campus’s “unwelcoming atmosphere, "" and finally that to the inhabitant of the city the university felt “far away” and “a big mystery.”. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Chris Steyaert, Timon Beyes and Martin Parker.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082201195

The purpose of our chapter is to problematise the use of humanities in management education in the context of a number of phenomena underlying education within the contemporary business school, and in particular against the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of student debt. Debt already ‘weighs’ upon students as they enter the world of work, itself infused and changed by ‘the new spirit of capitalism’, which has brought with it, for example, the passionate body and the assertive bodily comportments as central to labour on account of this passion’s connection to creativity and excess; the eschewing of routines and the production of scenic emergence and unique character; and the shift from discipline to control, that is from the confined body to excessive and continuous modulation. These changes in the world of work, combined with the ubiquity of debt amongst individuals who hope to successfully function and build livelihoods within this world, have raised questions about which kind of subjectivity is deemed appropriate for such new labour market premises, and what role the business school can play in the formation of this subjectivity of an indebted, passionate, flexible worker. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Chris Steyaert, Timon Beyes and Martin Parker.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063002993

We do so because we want to provide students with a “feeling for the organization” (Keller 1983). Sometimes we use artistic methods, for example by asking students to make drawings of where they are positioned in their organization or to take photos of a phenomenon that we have asked them to “see” in an organization (for example, organizational learning). The idea is to make students present the photos and drawings in class and with these means enter an experimental, playful discussion into how their position could be different and how a representation of an organizational phenomenon reflects a certain theoretical understanding thereof. We believe that it is through our joint working with these experiments, which speaks to the aesthetic and emotional aspects of experiences, that we can guide students to work with theories and concepts in an “instrumental” (discussed later) way as “tools to think” with. © 2016 selection and editorial material, Chris Steyaert, Timon Beyes and Martin Parker.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051950714

These indicators can be constructed using two different approaches, each having their strengths and limitations. The top-down approach is based on environmentally extended input-output analysis and quantifies the environmental impacts of product groups and services provided by industrial sectors. The bottom-up approach is based on Life Cycle Assessment and quantifies the environmental impacts of a selection of representative products. The bottom-up approach has already been used by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre to calculate the impacts of the final consumption per capita in the European Union in 2006. In this paper, we calculated these impacts through a top-down approach, using the Exiobase database. The covered household activities are food, consumer goods, mobility, shelter and services. The goal was to calculate all the impact categories recommended by the International Reference Life Cycle Data handbook, and compare both approaches. However, the categories ionizing radiation, toxicity and abiotic resource depletion could not be included, as some relevant emissions and resources are not available in Exiobase. To study more profoundly the impact on natural resources, we added the Cumulative Exergy Extraction From the Natural Environment to the impact assessment. When comparing both approaches, it can be concluded that there is a considerable shift in the results. This means that the information obtained by a top-down approach could supplement the information base for policy support. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to expand upon the research of mentoring based on a literature review and an empirical study of mentoring expatriates in three transnational companies. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on findings from three case companies based in Denmark. In total, 37 semi-structured interviews were conducted with expatriates, managers and vice presidents at the three home organizations and their subsidiaries. Findings – Several empirical studies, including the study presented in this paper, indicate that ethnocentrism in the home-company is a main constraint for cross-cultural learning mediated by the expatriates. It is suggested that the HR department in the home-company should create specialized professional training programs and recruit employees with practical knowledge about expatriation. However, personal and relational mentoring should be conducted by experienced and motivated individuals who are supported and recognized, but not controlled, by the HR department. Research limitations/implications – This research is focused on Danish companies and further research is needed to test the theories in other cultural settings. Practical implications – This research can help companies and expatriates gain a more successful expatriation period.

(1988, 1989), namely, its dimensionality and internal consistency. The theoretical basis of the construct is discussed in relation to formative and reflective measurement approaches. Design/methodology/approach – Two different ways of organizing the adjustment items (random/non-random) were used to assess the internal consistency of the three-dimensional adjustment scale. The quantitative analysis presented is based on survey data from 468 assigned expatriates in Asia that were subjected to an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis as well as a structural equation modeling – more specifically the multiple indicators multiple causes model (MIMIC). Findings – The study revealed that the adjustment construct is possibly misspecified, especially the general adjustment dimension, that was tested as a formative, not a reflective scale. There is further evidence that the wrong measurement approach skewed the coefficient that connects adjustment to performance, which is the key construct in its nomological network. Moreover, the dimensionality and the internal consistency of the scale are deteriorated to a large extent by randomization of the items.

As a research area, green lean six sigma (GLS) is proposed to have strategic importance in product development towards cutting costs, contributing to optimisation, and achieving sustainability. This research requirement has been realised to draw benefits out of three recent and involved approaches (green, lean and six sigma). In this research, an attempt has been made to address barriers in GLS product development (GLSPD) from an extensive literature review and from experts’ opinions towards developing a hierarchical model structuring these barriers. Twenty-one barriers have been identified and sorted from the review of literature and were then validated through discussions with experts. Relationships (contextual in nature) among these barriers have been realised during a brainstorming session. An interpretive structural modelling (ISM) technique has been utilised for developing a hierarchical model of barriers in implementing the GLSPD process in the automobile sector of India. A nine-level structural model has been deduced after application of the ISM technique, which shows ‘Competition and Uncertainty’ as the topmost output of the model and ‘Lack of Total Top Management Commitment’ as the bottom-level input to other barriers of the model. Further, MICMAC analysis has been also done to classify these barriers for better understanding; seven barriers are identified as driver barriers, nine as dependent, five barriers as linkage and no barrier as autonomous. An analysis of interdependence and interactions among these barriers may help supply chain managers reach a better understanding of barriers. Thus, managers may be helped in prioritising and managing barriers in order to gain a competitive advantage from GLS concept implementation in product development. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Barriers; Design for six sigma (DFSS); GLS product development (GLSPD); Green lean six sigma (GLS); Green product development (GPD); Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); Lean product development (LPD); MICMAC analysis; New product development (NPD)","Competition; Hierarchical systems; Lean production; Managers; Process monitoring; Product design; Product development; Six sigma; Structural analysis; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Work simplification; Barriers; Design for Six Sigma; GLS product development (GLSPD); Green product development; Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); Lean product development; Lean Six Sigma; MICMAC analysis; New product development; Process engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965082035

Much research has addressed schooling, training, and other aspects of human capital accumulation, but less emphasis has been placed on the interaction between firms and other organizations as a key driver of the development of new knowledge and its economic use. There is an extensive body of literature that discusses various aspects of knowledge transfer and innovation diffusion between firms, and this literature may serve as a microfoundation for understanding the role of knowledge in the growth process. However, we need to understand the role of the entrepreneur as a missing link between knowledge and innovation. The purpose of this paper is to outline some foundations of endogenous (externally driven) growth models, and uses the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship to propose a new model of latent and emergent entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses the method of conceptual analysis to structure the literature and its assumptions. The authors review in broad terms what we know in the space of knowledge and growth, and what we still need to know. The authors curate informed views on the topic of knowledge and the way that entrepreneurs contribute to innovation diffusion. Findings – The paper develops a new perspective on knowledge. Starting from the role of knowledge as a core element in the microfoundations of endogenous growth models, it uses the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship to propose a new model of latent and emergent entrepreneurship. Practical implications – The paper uses knowledge spillover theory to lay out a more complete and more realistic process through which knowledge gets converted into realized innovations, and as such, it makes the intervention points through which people management can facilitate organizational effectiveness through innovation more transparent. Originality/value – The paper provides guidance for future researchers on knowledge and innovation diffusion. It encourages innovation in our thinking about the role of knowledge, and allows scholars to combine perspectives more flexibly both across levels of analysis (macro and micro), and across disciplines (economy and management). © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Growth; Innovation; Knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051302325

Storytelling is one of the areas to which volunteers are increasingly contributing; however, the role of volunteers has been offered only sporadic attention. The aim of this study is to provide insights into volunteer involvement by studying volunteers as destination stakeholders with focus on their roles, influence, and contribution. A cross-case analysis of three Nordic cases is undertaken. A theoretical framework is developed based on volunteer tourism, stakeholder theory, and marketing literature on storytelling. A three-phase model of the storytelling process is developed. Findings show substantial variation. Unsurprisingly, early inclusion of volunteers result in substantial influence on the storytelling concept, however, this does not guarantee volunteer involvement later on. Conversely, late inclusion of volunteers does not necessarily hinder engagement among volunteers in the execution of the stories. All cases demonstrate that developing a strong concept that can tie together the efforts of stakeholders across professional and volunteer divides is a major challenge. The results point at the importance of strategic goals coordinating storytelling activities, volunteer inclusion, and ‘use’ of volunteers' local knowledge and enthusiasm in all phases of the destination-based storytelling process planned along with strategic goals such as ‘selling place’ or ‘building community’. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","destination development; destination-based storytelling; stakeholders; volunteers' influence; volunteers’ roles","building; planning process; stakeholder; strategic approach; theoretical study; tourism; traditional knowledge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032105040

Specifically, the authors test whether a founders’ low personal net worth is correlated with a lower probability of acquiring funding from outside sources during the business creation process. Design/methodology/approach – The authors use a double-hurdle Cragg model to jointly estimate: first, the decision to acquire external financing; and second, the amount received. The sample is the US-based Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics II (PSED II). The PSED II tracks business founders attempting to start ventures from 2005 to 2012. Findings – Receipt of outside financing during business formation is largely determined by the business founder’s personal finances (controlling for human capital, venture type and industry, and whether money was sought in the first place). A higher household net worth results in larger amounts of external funding received. Low-wealth business founders, therefore, are less likely to get external funds, and they receive lower amounts when they do. The disparity between low-and high-wealth business founders is more pronounced for formal, monitored sources of external financing such as bank loans. Research limitations/implications – Because the study eliminates survivor bias by using a nationally representative sample of business founders who are in the venture creation process, the findings apply to both successful business founders and those who disengaged during the business creation process. The authors offer insights into the sources and amounts of external funds acquired by individuals across all levels of wealth. The authors accomplish this by disaggregating business founders into wealth quintiles. The study demonstrates the importance of personal wealth as a factor in acquiring external startup financing compared to human capital, industry, or personal characteristics. Social implications – If the ability to acquire external funding is significantly constrained, the quality of the opportunity and the skill of the business founder may be less a determinant of success at creating a new business as prior studies have suggested. Consequently, entrepreneurship (as measured by business formation) as a path toward upward, socioeconomic mobility will be afforded only to those individuals with sufficient financial endowments at the outset. Originality/value – Unlike prior studies, the data used are not subject to survivor bias or an underrepresentation of self-employment. The statistical model jointly estimates acquisition of financing and the amount received. This resolves selection and censoring problems. Finally, the dependent variables directly measure liquidity constraints in the context of business formation, that is, before a new venture is created. Prior research contexts have typically studied existing businesses, and are therefore not true examinations of conditions affecting business creation. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurialism; Financing; Liquidity constraints; Nascent entrepreneurship; Wealth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976597359

However, while this positive direct effect of backward compatibility dominates in our setting, we also observe a (weaker) negative indirect effect working through the reduced supply of new software.

We find a positive relationship between growth and profitability among gazelle firms.

The insider AR project took place at a large Danish surgical ward with 60 participating physicians and nurses. The study was conducted in three interconnected action and reflection cycles using mixed methods. Staff viewed the co-creation and co-inquiry as important resources in transforming the ward into a better microsystem. Microsystems as a theoretical framework was used to conceive the success of health system redesign as a matter of enabling the clinical team to meet patient needs. By combining insider AR with microsystems, this study highlights the importance of senior leaders to recognize the nature and power of using the microsystem approach for strategy, excellence, innovation, and research.

Their growth depends on continuous innovation, which is important in many industries and also challenging to manage because of inherent tensions. Creative industries, similar to many industries, depend not only on novelty to attract consumers, but also on familiarity to aid comprehension and stabilize demand for cultural products. Agents in the creative industries play with these tensions, generating novelty that shifts industries’ labels and boundaries. This tension and agency makes them a valuable setting for advancing theoretical ideas on who drives innovation, from mavericks that challenge conventions to mainstreams that build upon them. We trace this history and then turn to the five papers in the special issue, which examine in depth how mavericks, misfits, mainstreams and amphibians in various creative domains, from artistic perfumery to choreography, engage with innovation and address tensions.

Taking a discursive analytical approach, the article examines interviews with 19 managers and 43 colleagues who all worked closely with an employee with cerebral palsy in 13 different work organizations. The primary finding of the article is that co-workers spontaneously refer to other ‘different’ people (e.g. transvestites, homosexuals, immigrants) when talking about a colleague with visible impairments. This finding suggests that disability is simultaneously a discursive category (i.e. the discourse of ableism prevents co-workers from talking about the impairments of a colleague) and a material phenomenon (i.e. employees with impairments are a distinct category of employees in the eyes of the co-workers). Othering of employees with disabilities thus demonstrates contradictory discourses of ableism (which automatically produce difference) and tolerance and inclusiveness (which automatically render it problematic to talk about difference). © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","ableism; co-workers; colleagues; difference; disability; discourse analysis; employees; impairments; managers; othering; work organizations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971439937

In contrast, shareholdings of banks' CEOs do not have a direct impact on bank failure.

This article formulates a methodology for quantifying the degree of comply or explain disclosure.The analysis shows that there is a positive link between ROE/ROA and Danish firm total corporate governance comply or explain disclosure scores. Specifically, this is also the case when this level is increased within the following two categories: board composition and remuneration policy, whereas there is no impact on performance when increasing compliance with the recommendations on risk management and internal controls. This article demonstrates that these three areas are the ones where Danish firms show the lowest degree of comply or explain disclosure, although the overall adherence to the Danish code's many recommendations is relatively high.This article relates to the burgeoning literature that deals with listed firm compliance with national corporate governance codes and how compliance can be appropriately quantified. It is suggested that compliance is classified into the following four categories: complies, complies poorly, explains and explains poorly. The article demonstrates that measuring the degree of compliance cannot be done in a mechanical way. Instead, it must be customized to the respective national institutional environment, which suggests country comparisons will be difficult to make. The article contributes to the ongoing discussion of whether firms consider soft law to be a ""tick the box"" exercise or, alternatively, whether firms should work seriously with the recommendations in order to professionalize and increase competences among board members. The article's findings suggest that soft law may be an efficient way of increasing the quality of corporate governance among listed firms. However, in order to strengthen investor confidence, national code authorities/committees should be more active in penalizing poor explanations as well as cases where firms wrongfully state that they comply with a specific recommendation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Comply or explain; Corporate governance; Disclosure; Firm performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964407327

Based on the key motive of maximizing one’s lifetime income, Lazear posits that individuals with a balanced set of skills should have a higher probability of being self-employed. His “Jack-of-all-trades” hypothesis presumes that entrepreneurs need sufficient knowledge in a variety of areas to succeed, while paid employees benefit from being specialists in a certain area demanded by the labor market. Because most women-led businesses are neither based on the motive of making money nor are they growth oriented, we argue that maximizing their lifetime income is not the main motivation of many women to start a business. However, we argue that Lazear’s theory can be extended to motivations that are mostly stated for women entrepreneurs as well. We apply it to a specific representative sample of 1384 women graduates in Germany and test our hypothesis with logit regression. A dichotomized measure indicating whether a women graduate was self-employed (n = 706) or not (n = 678) served as the dependent variable. Our results widely confirm Lazear’s assumption for women graduates who run relatively small businesses in terms of sales and employment: professional training, balanced industry experience, and balanced entrepreneurship-based self-efficacy increase the probability of being self-employed. Solo self-employed tend to have balanced industry experience more often than those being in a team or having employees. Lazear’s theory has male as the norm, and as such, does not readily apply to the case of women—but could and should be extended to women’s specifics. © 2016, The Author(s).","Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship-based self-efficacy; Jack-of-all-trades theory; Lazear; Lifetime income; Motives; Self-employment; Women graduates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962228059

Naturally, one would imagine that environmental considerations have already been accounted for in competition policy practice, but thus far, only in the case of voluntary environmental agreements. This paper analyzes the extent to which the two types of policy are complementary by examining the legal framework of competition policy, voluntary environmental agreements and three competition cases with equal relevance to the environment and then examines the basic theoretical economic observation that less competition implies lower pollution levels relative to more competition. This trade-off between the benefits of reduced emissions on the one side and increased competition on the other implies that disregarding environmental considerations in the implementation of competition policy entails a negative externality, which can be eliminated if environmental considerations are internalized in competition policy. The impact of the externality is found to depend on the emission level, the emission damage, and market size. Further, this implies that if competition authorities were to adopt a broad definition of the relevant market in competition cases, then environmental considerations would play a limited role in competition policy, whereas a narrow definition implies that environmental considerations should have a much more important place than competitive considerations in competition policy. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Competition analysis; Competition policy; Environmental damage; Environmental policy; Optimal market structure; Social costs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939248790

Our analysis demonstrates that the perceived alignment with the financial report preparation and the explicit pursuit of auditability legitimized SER and paved the way for data systems to be changed. The programme borrowed authority from financial accounting technologies not only to make a system change but also to push SER internally, as we suggest that an intraorganizational group used the programme to ensure the existence and organizational status of SER.

It seems to fundamentally contradict traditional values in Chinese culture. The effect of employee participation on innovation is completely unknown, not only for China, but also for many other emerging economies. In contrast, employee participation finds a lot of recognition in the western world for quite some while. Research suggests that employee participation is particularly relevant for innovations in skilled labour contexts, which are becoming increasingly important also for China. Based on a survey of 620 medium-sized and large companies we are investigating the effect of employee participation on innovation generation and commercialisation in China. In the formulation of our hypotheses we take the moderating effects of incentives into account. The contribution of this article is to give evidence on the explanation power of the western concept of employee participation outside the western world. This allows for a better understanding of the robustness of the concept towards cultural context factors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","China; employee participation; employee-driven innovation (EDI); innovation; monetary incentives; non-monetary incentives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938851065

This article questions whether such reforms automatically have these outcomes or whether and how possibilities for local adjustment of such reforms may prevent negative outcomes. Drawing on empirical case studies from two Danish municipal schools and the concept of organisational social capital, we investigate how two reform initiatives – ‘student plan-based school–home collaboration’ and ‘teamwork’ – were locally adjusted into collaborative practices. The analysis demonstrates surprising local adjustments of the reform initiatives, while also revealing some ambiguities. The results demonstrate that some reform initiatives can lead to new collaborative leadership and management practices in schools that solve the central school leadership and management tasks of coordination and planning. This indicates that collaborative leadership and management practices may emerge from NPM reforms, and that such practices can prevent negative outcomes of such reforms. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","New public management; social capital; student plans and teamwork",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992366156

This article demonstrates the role of technology views in these processes. Based on ethnographic data from two design processes and interview data from supplementary cases in Denmark, the article points to a gap between what practitioners view as necessary to secure funding and what they view as necessary for designing meaningful digital museum communication. This gap is identified by analysing the data in relation to a continuum of technology conceptualisations, constructed with inspiration from science and technology studies and information systems research. To bridge the gap, funding bodies and museum designers are encouraged to focus on processes rather than on product specifications when funding and designing digital museum communication. Furthermore, museum researchers are encouraged to pay more attention to the processes in which digital museum communication emerges. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","co-design; collaborative design; digital designers; digital museum communication; funding bodies; Technology views",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964057704

Research that focuses on identifying visitors’ norms within outdoor recreation settings has not been able to link the geographical location with the corresponding evaluation of unacceptable levels of impact. This study combines a traditional on-site visitor survey with a Public Participation Geographic Information Systems survey to produce spatially explicit information on visitors’ acceptance of tourism impacts. Using a web-based participatory survey, visitors were asked to indicate specific locations where they felt the effects of tourism disturbed the quality of their experience in Oulanka National Park. These evaluations were analyzed at multiple scales – destination, specific zones, and sites – to promote more efficient park management. Based on visitor evaluations, we found a collection of hotspots in the park where tourism has already caused unacceptable impacts. Visitors noted that crowding and erosion disturbed their experiences, especially along highly visited trail sections, while littering was considered problematic near wilderness huts. However, participant satisfaction at these sites was not lower than elsewhere in the park. This indicates that the association between negative impacts of tourism and visitor satisfaction is not straightforward, but complex. This study encourages the collection of spatially accurate data on visitors’ assessments of the effects of tourism because it has the potential to more efficiently direct park management policies. In addition, spatial techniques provide a new means to monitor the impacts of tourism, acknowledging that visitors’ perceptions of acceptability of tourism impacts also vary within tourism destinations, such as parks. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Finland; normative theory; Oulanka National Park; PPGIS; satisfaction; Tourism impact; visitor","GIS; national park; outdoor recreation; park management; tourism; tourist destination; Finland; Oulanka National Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962895470

In particular, the paper offers a preliminary assessment of how the GPs’ corporate responsibility to respect human rights has been interpreted and to what extent it has been operationalised through government action, business behaviour and the praxis of other social actors. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides a comprehensive assessment of a number of key developments related to Pillar 2 of the GPs – concerned with the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. More specifically, the paper considers a range of elements relating to corporate human rights due diligence, including: establishing a corporate human rights policy; the undertaking of human rights impact assessment; integrating findings of impact assessment, and; corporate human rights reporting. Findings – Based on the assessment of recent developments and initiatives, the paper suggests that the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, as expressed in Pillar 2 of the GPs, embodies the culmination of significant progress in the sphere of corporate accountability. In doing so, the paper documents a plethora of innovations in regulation and praxis, led by actors in government and the corporate sector, civil society organisations, labour unions and others, in the areas of human rights due diligence, impact assessment and reporting. Yet overall, change is slow and partial and the results achieved are still unsatisfactory. Severe business-related human rights abuses remain endemic in many industry sectors and in many countries. Research limitations/implications – The implementation of the GPs is at a key stage of development, with a multitude of initiatives and actors attempting to develop and influence new forms of corporate governance. This paper provides an overview and assessment of these key developments.

Here it is claimed that it is the semantic relationship between two paired concepts what determines the emergence of different types of neutrality, namely indeterminacy, ambivalence and conflict, widely used under different frameworks (possibly under different names). It will be shown the potential relevance of paired structures, generated from two paired concepts together with their associated neutrality, all of them to be modeled as fuzzy sets. In this way, paired structures can be viewed as a standard basic model from which different models arise. This unifying view should therefore allow a deeper analysis of the relationships between several existing knowledge representation formalisms, providing a basis from which more expressive models can be later developed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In developing countries, the gap between IT development and the local use situation is larger than in western countries. However, usability is neither well addressed in software practice nor at the policy making level in Ethiopia. Software practitioners focus on functional requirements, meeting deadlines and budget. The software development industry in Ethiopia is in its early stage. The article aims at understanding usability practices in an Ethiopian software development company. Developers, system analysts, product owners and users were studied. In this first phase of the research, participatory observation, a workshop and interviews with practitioners and operational staff were analyzed. Informal discussions have been observed to outweigh formal meetings for sharing experience and ideas. Practitioners' internal configuration, their experience, cultural knowledge and common sense regarding the users' situation guided the design. Prototypes and fast delivery of working versions helped in getting user feedback even if early user focus proved to be a challenge as communication between developers and users suffered from several layers of indirection. Further challenges are the heterogeneity of users to be supported, a lack of awareness of usability methods, and lacking resources. © 2016 ACM.","Agile team communication; ASDMs; Operational staff; PC; Product owner; UCD; Usability; User focus","Budget control; Developing countries; Personal computers; Software engineering; Usability engineering; User centered design; Agile teams; ASDMs; Operational staff; Product owner; Usability; User focus; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84974625230

These advances have contributed to further reflexivity and called for novel ways to animate representations. On this background, this article develops the notion ‘distorted representation’ to illustrate that blurred and obscure photos can in fact be intelligible and sensible in understanding tourism. Through an exploration of the overwhelmed and unintended practices of visual fieldwork, distorted representation illustrates how photographic materialities, performativities and sensations contribute to new tourism knowledges. While highlighting the potential of distorted representation, the article posits a cautionary note in regards to the influential role of academic journals in determining the qualities of visual data.

Research has shown that environmental quality is associated with human behaviour. Therefore, minimising waste generation and energy consumption in construction projects is important. This study investigates the influence of the environmental practice of construction firms on practitioners' environmental behaviour during project implementation. Data for the study are obtained from a sample of 375 architectural, engineering, and contracting firms in Malaysia. The partial least squares technique is used for data analysis. The results indicate that firms' energy efficiency and waste management practices have a positive effect on the environmental behaviour of practitioners during project implementation. The results imply that when construction firms are engaged in energy efficiency or waste management activities, an increase in environmental behaviour will occur in the projects in which these practitioners are involved. This study is one of first attempts to investigate the relationship between the environmental practices of construction firms and the environmental behaviour of professionals during project implementation within the construction industry.

The demand for 3PL providers has become a main approach for companies to offer better customer service, reduce costs, and gain competitive advantage. This paper identifies important criteria for 3PL provider selection and evaluation, and the purpose of this paper is to select 3PL providers from the viewpoint of firms which were already outsourcing their logistics services. Design/methodology/approach - This study utilized the grey decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to develop 3PL provider selection criteria. Because human judgments are vague and complicated to depict by accurate numerical values, the grey system theory is used to handle this problem. Findings - The findings revealed the structure and interrelationships between criteria and identified the main criteria for 3PL provider selection. The most important criteria for 3PL provider selection are on time delivery performance, technological capability, financial stability, human resource policies, service quality, and customer service, respectively. Practical implications - The paper's results help managers of automotive industries, particularly in developing countries, to outsource logistics activities to 3PL providers effectively and to create a significant competitive advantage. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, this paper proposes an integrated grey DEMATEL method to consider interdependent relationships among the 3PL provider selection criteria.

Comparisons between GPS-determined and self-reported transport in leisure time were investigated. Second, associations between parental perceptions of the neighborhood environment and GPS-determined walking, cycling and passive transport in leisure time were studied. Methods: Children (10 to 12-years old; n = 126) wore a GPS device and an accelerometer for 7 consecutive days to assess objectively measured transport in leisure time and filled out a diary to assess self-reported transport in leisure time. Parents completed a questionnaire to assess parental perceptions of the neighborhood environment. Pearson correlations and t-tests were used to test for concurrent validity and differences between GPS-determined and self-reported transport in leisure time. Generalized linear models were used to determine the associations between the parental perceptions of the neighborhood environment and GPS-determined transport in leisure time. Results: Overall, children under-reported their walking and cycling in leisure time, compared to GPS-determined measures (all p values <0.001). However, children reported their passive transport in leisure time during weekend days quite accurate. GPS-determined measures revealed that children walked most during weekdays (M = 3.96 trips/day; 26.10 min/day) and used passive transport more frequently during weekend days (M = 2.12 trips/day; 31.39 min/day). Only a few parental perceived environmental attributes of the neighborhood (i.e. residential density, land use mix access, quality and availability of walking and cycling facilities, and aesthetics) were significantly associated with children's GPS-determined walking, cycling or passive transport in leisure time. Conclusions: To accurately assess children's active transport in leisure time, GPS measures are recommended over self-reports. More research using GPS with a focus on children's transport in leisure time and investigating the associations with parental perceptions of the neighborhood environment is needed to confirm the results of the present study. © 2016 Vanwolleghem et al.","Children; GPS; Physical environment; Transport in leisure time","child; cycle transport; GPS; neighborhood; perception; recreational activity; walking; accelerometry; child; cycling; demography; environmental planning; female; geographic information system; health behavior; human; information processing; leisure; male; parent; procedures; psychology; safety; self report; socioeconomics; standards; statistics and numerical data; time factor; traffic and transport; walking; Accelerometry; Bicycling; Child; Data Collection; Environment Design; Female; Geographic Information Systems; Health Behavior; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Parents; Residence Characteristics; Safety; Self Report; Socioeconomic Factors; Time Factors; Transportation; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965081831

Design/methodology/approach – A cross-sectional study design using both semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires was used. The study was conducted in the Eastern part of Kenya and included 600 smallholders. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings – The results show that price fairness, price reliability, and relative price are dimensions of price satisfaction that affect producers’ trust in the buyer. Moreover, trust between the producer and the buyer is found to be a strong mediator between price satisfaction and producer loyalty. The findings support recent studies about trust and its mediating role.

The object of this study is the analogue terrestrial television (ATT) switch-off in Denmark. The units of analysis are the whole Danish population and elderly Danish citizens. The rate of awareness-knowledge of the ATT switch-off among all Danish households and the rate of awareness-knowledge of the ATT switch-off among elderly citizens aged 65+ were measured. Findings – In the three month campaign period the double-digit gab (12 percent) was reduced to a 2 percent gap. It appears that interpersonal network communication can have an effect, with respect to elderly citizens who are targeted by change agent aides. Research limitations/implications – It is a limitation of this study that the change agent aides were not monitored and surveyed systematically to document their effort. Practical implications – It is likely that the use of change agent aides can make sense with respect to other target groups. However, the use of change agent aides will not necessarily work with any subject matter. Who can benefit from using change agent aides, can vary from subject matter to subject matter, and with the complexity of the subject matter. Social implications – In some instances society has an obligation to make sure that people who are communicatively and socially isolated, dyslectic, old, physically and mentally challenged, and/or anti-media are also informed. With this in mind interpersonal network communication also has relevance as part of future public information campaigns. Originality/value – Little research appears to have been carried out in recent years. One can only speculate as to why apparently no research has been carried out in recent years, but if practitioners are unsure of the effect of using change agent aides, for instance, they may refrain from using them, and consequently there may not be many cases to study. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Campaign; Change agent; Change agent aides; Interpersonal diffusion networks; Interpersonal network communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962883624

So, the partners of the chains seek to apply efficient coordinating strategies like discount, return, refund, buyback, or the other coordinating policies to abate the operation costs of the chains and subsequently increase market shares. Hence, because of the importance and application of these strategies in the current non-exclusive markets, in this study, we introduce different composite coordinating strategies to enhance the coordination of the supply chains. Here, we consider two competing supply chains where both chains launch the same product under different brands to the market by applying different composite coordinating strategies. Each supply chain comprises one manufacturer and a group of non-competing retailers where the manufacturer receives raw materials from an outside supplier and transforms them into a finished product; then, the products are sold to the retailers to satisfy the demands of market. In the first chain, a composite (QFF) policy, which is the combination of quantity and freight discount, as well as free shipping quantity policies, are considered between upstream and downstream members while in the second one, different composite polices are considered between upstream and downstream members such that the supplier offers a composite policy, as the first chain, to the manufacturer and the manufacturer proposes a composite (QPR) policy, which is the combination of quantity discount and partial-refund customer return policies, to the retailers. The main objective of the paper is to determine the optimal selling prices and the order quantities of the manufacturer and the retailers in each chain in presence of different composite coordinating strategies. A Stackelberg game-theoretic approach is employed between the members of each chain where the manufacturer is a follower and the retailers are leaders. The concavity of profit functions is proved. Finally, the applicability of the models is justified by presented numerical examples. Moreover, the effects of these strategies on the decisions of the chains partners are examined. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","free shipping policy; game theory; inventory; partial-refund customer returns policy; pricing; quantity discount; supply chain","Commerce; Competition; Costs; Game theory; Manufacture; Sales; Ships; Competing supply chains; Competitive markets; Customer returns policies; Finished products; Free shipping; inventory; Optimal selling price; Quantity discount; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961627593

This occupation provides a window through which to view one key way in which animals and organizations intersect in modern society. Given its proximity to death and undesirable required tasks, working in a slaughterhouse is classified as ‘dirty work’. Current theorizing, however, does not address how the intentional killing of animals may impact workers beyond its inherent dirtiness and low prestige. In this study, we draw upon and extend dirty work theory to further understand the unique nature of work that involves the intentional killing of animals. Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior. Our findings hold while statistically controlling for occupational prestige and overall dirtiness. Additionally, we compare the pattern of results with a comparable occupation that does not involve animal killing, suggesting specific outcomes associated with routinized killing of animals.

In so doing, we challenge the latent anthropocentricism in many, if not most, theories of organization that locate animal agencies outside the boundary work that is said to constitute organizing. In developing this argument, we draw together diverse strands of work mobilizing Actor–Network Theory that engage the entanglement of human/nonhuman agencies. In bringing this work together, we suggest humans may organize, even manage, by conducting relational boundary work with animal agencies, spacings and timings. Our argument is empirically illustrated and theoretically developed across two cases of the spacings and timings of construction project organizations—an infrastructure project in the United Kingdom and a housing development in Scandinavia. Construction projects are well-known for their tightly managed linear timings and for producing the built spaces that separate humans and animals. Three concepts—Invitation, Exclusion and Disturbance—are offered to help apprehend how such organizings of space and time are themselves dependent upon entanglements between human and animal agencies. We conclude by suggesting that animals should not be negatively constituted as an ‘Other’ to human organizing, or indeed management, but rather acknowledged as sometimes constituting human capacities to organize, even managerially control, space and time. © 2016, The Author(s) 2016.","Actor–network theories; animal geographies; construction; organizational boundaries; organizational spaces and times",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964267952

In both studies, requesters who offered no incentives underestimated the likelihood that those they approached would grant their requests; however, when requesters offered monetary incentives, this prediction error was mitigated.

We start with a definition of PCSR, focusing on firms' contribution to public goods. We then discuss historical antecedents to the debate and outline the original economic and political context. The following section explores emerging changes in the institutional context relevant to PCSR and reconsiders some of the assumptions underlying Habermas' thesis of the postnational constellation. This highlights some neglected issues in previous works on PCSR, including the influence of nationalism and fundamentalism, the role of various types of business organisations, the return of government regulation, the complexity of institutional contexts, the efficiency of private governance, the financialization and digitalization of the economy, and the relevance of managerial sensemaking.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a state-of-the-art method for conducting environmental assessments of systems, whether these consist of goods or services, or a combination of the two. However, current LCA guidelines focus on assessing tangible products and lack specific attention to more complex systems, such as Product/Service-Systems (PSS), which also consist of intangible elements. PSS imply a shift in business paradigm from selling specific products to delivering a function, through a mix of products and services, thereby incentivising resource efficiency as well as user satisfaction. Despite their potential to reduce environmental impacts, PSS are not by default more environmentally benign compared to conventional systems, and quantifications of their environmental performance are called for. This paper contributes by showing that specific challenges need to be addressed when using LCA to evaluate the environmental performance of PSS. We identify a set of PSS characteristics that can challenge an LCA study. Three relevant scopes are distinguished, where LCA may be applied: (1) evaluating options within the PSS itself; (2) comparing a PSS with an alternative; and (3) modelling the actual contextual changes caused by the PSS. We derive three pronounced challenges when conducting LCA within the three scopes: (i) identifying and defining the reference system; (ii) defining the functional unit; and (iii) setting system boundaries. We elaborate on how these challenges are discussed in current literature. Recommended future work includes developing adapted guidelines and further empirical case studies that quantify the environmental changes and impacts caused by introducing PSS. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental impacts; Functional unit; Life Cycle Assessment; Product/Service-Systems; Reference system; System boundaries","Environmental impact; Environmental management; Functional units; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Product/Service-Systems; Reference systems; System boundary; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960800047

To control for the potential endogeneity of the offshoring decision, the paper uses instrumental variables and propensity score-matching approaches. The data allow me to control for the heterogeneity between the units by using firm-level offshoring activities in different regions and performing the empirical analysis on plantlevel aggregation, which is shown to be of crucial importance. Using firm as a unit of observation, the effect of offshoring is, if any, very small. However, using plant as a unit of observation, there are strong indications that offshoring plays a much larger role for the extensive and intensive margin of adjustments. The results reveal that plants survival prospect is higher if the main offshoring is located in high-wage countries; lower if it is located in low-wage countries; and not affected if it is located in medium-wage countries. Finally, the results also reveal that depending on where the main offshoring is located, the growth rate of low-skilled employment is 2 to 8 per cent lower in plants of offshoring firms.

We explore the organizational transition needed to yield this new legitimacy approach. We argue that, in this context, legitimacy gains may increase when firms are able to reduce the control over the engagements and relate non-hierarchically with their publics.

These communities we take to be basic and essential for communication and sharing of knowledge among human beings. As there are not very much evidence on the CWE support of all these five communities we use theories on Knowledge Management as a stepping stone, because there are substantial evidence of support for Knowledge Management by CWE, even though Knowledge Management lacks a sound theoretical foundation.

Firstly, to make an overview of the assessments of the global warming potential from the treatment alternatives incineration, landfill, anaerobic digestion and compost in studies reported in literature. Secondly, to identify decisive factors in general and related to system boundary settings in particular, in reviewed studies. A number of criteria were constructed for identification of relevant comparative life cycle assessments, resulting in selection of nineteen studies, containing 103 different scenarios. The systematic investigation of the studies show examples of several methodological differences as well as choices in systems boundary setting causing misleading comparisons between different treatment options, but also large variations in used input data for modeling of similar processes. The review also shows that the most significant differences in global warming results in many cases can be explained by assumptions made in relation to the background system, rather than by differences in data on emissions surging from to the foreground system. Especially assumptions on the interaction of the waste management system with the background energy system and/or bio-system were found to be decisive to the results. This highlights the importance of identification of induced and displaced marginal products in the modeling of system expansion, as well as need for increased transparency and use of sensitivity analyses related to assumptions made in background system modeling, in order to reveal under which set of assumptions results gained in the assessment are valid. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Background system; Food waste; Life-cycle assessment; Organic fraction municipal solid waste","Anaerobic digestion; Composting; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Sensitivity analysis; Waste incineration; Background systems; Comparative life cycle assessment; Different treatments; Food waste; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Organic fractions; Waste management systems; Waste management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959261504

Few studies have however empirically investigated the relationship between goal conflicts and goal commitment. This study examines the interplay between public managers’ goal prioritization, goal conflict and employees’ goal commitment. Multilevel data from 73 principals and 1464 teachers in secondary education show that goal conflict has a negative effect on the relationship between goal prioritization and goal commitment.

And why does Europe seem to be more conservative than the USA in dealing with the crisis? Since the outbreak of the current international economic crisis in 2008, the USA and many of the European countries have been tormented by high levels of unemployment and low levels of inflation, interest rates close to zero and fiscal policies of austerity. As such, the modern economic mainstream has been challenged by these empirical facts. Today, several years after the outbreak of the international economic crisis, supply side effects do not seem to be increasing employment as the modern mainstream claimed they would. Aggregate demand has to play a more important role in macroeconomic analysis than hitherto. That is, there is a need for alternative explanations of how a modern macro economy is expected to function and how the macroeconomic outcome could be manipulated by the right economic policy proposals. As expressed by the contents of the present book, a Post Keynesian understanding proposes such an alternative theoretically, methodologically and in terms of policy measures. This book will present new materials and approaches, especially new evidence and new views on the potential problems of public debt, the European Union and the present crisis, Central Banking, hysteresis in an agent based framework, the foundations of macroeconomics and the problems of uncertainty. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Mogens Ove Madsen and Finn Olesen; individual chapters, the contributors.

First, it sets the context for the special issue by considering conceptions of patients and their roles in service delivery and improvement. Second, it introduces the contributions to the special issue, and identifies thematic resonance. Design/methodology/approach – The paper utilises a literature synthesis and thematic analysis of the special issue submissions. These emanated from the Ninth International Organisational Behaviour in Healthcare Conference, hosted by Copenhagen Business School on behalf of the Learned Society for Studies in Organizing Healthcare. Findings – The articles evidence a range of perspectives on patients’ roles in healthcare. These range from their being subject to, a mobilising focus for, and active participants in service delivery and improvement. Building upon the potential patient roles identified, this editorial develops five “ideal type” patient positions in healthcare delivery and improvement. These recognise that patients’ engagement with health care services is influenced both by personal characteristics and circumstances, which affect patients’ openness to engaging with health services, as well as the opportunities afforded to patients to engage, by organisations and their employees. Originality/value – The paper explores the relationally embedded nature of patient involvement in healthcare, inherent in the interdependence between patient and providers’ roles. The typology aims to prompt discussion regarding the conceptualisation patients’ roles in healthcare organisations, and the individual, employee, organisational and contextual factors that may help and hinder their involvement in service delivery and improvement.

The paper particularly aims to examine how patient narratives, in the form of diaries and radio montage, help to create new insights into patient experience for healthcare professionals, and support professionals’ enrolment and mobilisation in innovation projects. Design/methodology/approach – Two case studies were undertaken. These drew upon qualitative interviews with staff and participant observation during innovation workshops. Patient diaries and a recorded montage of patient voices were also collected. Findings – The findings illuminate translation processes in healthcare innovation and the emergence of meaning making process for staff through the active use of patient narratives. The paper highlights the critical role of meaning making as an enabler of patient-centred change processes in healthcare via: local clinic mangers defining problems and ideas; collecting and sharing patient narratives in innovation workshops; and healthcare professionals’ interpretation of patient narratives supporting new insights into patient experience. Practical implications – This study demonstrates how healthcare professionals’ meaning making can be supported by articulating, constructing, listening and interpreting patient narratives. The two cases demonstrate how patient narratives serve as reflective devices for healthcare professionals.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an analysis of four documents collected as part of an ethnographic case study regarding “The Perspective of the Patient” – a Danish Hospital’s patient-centred communication programme. Mapping methods inspired by Grounded Theory are used to qualify the analysis. Findings – The paper shows that strategic patient-centred communication addresses both a care-oriented approach to the patient and deploys market perceptions of patients. Market and care is seen as co-existing organizing modes that entail expectations to the patient. In the communication programme the patient is constructed in six information-seeking patient figures: affective patient; target group patient; citizen with rights; patient as a competent resource; user as active partner; and consumer. As a result, the patient-centred communication programme renders the patient as a flexible figure able to fit organizational demands of both care orientation and market concerns. Originality/value – This study contributes to qualitative research in organizational health communication by combining two subfields – patient-centredness and health communication – in an empirical study of how market and care are intertwined in a patient-centred communication programme. The argument goes beyond the prevalent prescriptive approaches to patient-centredness and healthcare communication, instead providing a critical analytical perspective on strategic communication and patient-centredness and showing how expectations are posed to both patient and organization. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Document analysis; Health communication; Healthcare management; Patient-centred care; Situational analysis; Strategy","clinical article; consumer; doctor patient relation; empiricism; expectation; grounded theory; health care organization; human; information seeking; market; medical information; perception; qualitative research; Denmark; medical information; patient care; patient participation; patient satisfaction; Denmark; Health Communication; Humans; Patient Participation; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962674439

Findings - The crowd and the committees' assessments of the value of the proposals were based on different features. The committee emphasized experience and inventors' seniority; the crowd set more store on informative idea descriptions but penalized overly complex and lengthy proposals. Research limitations/implications - The design of the innovation contest does not allow full comparison of the preference functions of crowd and committee. The findings from this case study cannot be generalized. The early stage of new product development seems fruitful for investigating crowdsourcing and knowledge management. Practical implications - Firms should consider adopting preference markets for idea screening and evaluation since they appraise ideas from different angles compared to managers. However, they complement, rather than substitute managerial evaluation, especially in the case of more detailed proposals. Originality/value - This is one of the first attempts to identify differences in the decision-making processes of crowds and committees. The paper identifies their strengths as evaluators of new product ideas and finds that the ""wisdom of crowds"" has some limitations in relation to the ability to process complex information. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Biotechnology; Crowdsourcing; Gamification; Innovation contest; New product development; Preference market","Biotechnology; Commerce; Crowdsourcing; Decision making; Knowledge management; Managers; Product development; Biotechnology companies; Decision making process; Design/methodology/approach; Gamification; New product development; Preference functions; Preference markets; Research and development; Research and development management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962407381

The authors investigate the relation as mediated by trust and justice. Design/methodology/approach – Data stem from a longitudinal study in which questionnaire responses were collected twice from 1,650 employees in 52 workplaces. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the two models. Design-based corrections were made to accommodate the multi-level structure of data. Findings – The analyses showed that knowledge hoarding was both an antecedent and a consequent of negative acts. First, over time, knowledge hoarding was indirectly related to negative acts mediated by trust and justice. Second, negative acts were both directly and indirectly related to knowledge hoarding over time. The study thus points to the existence of a vicious circle of negative acts, psychological states of trust and justice, and knowledge hoarding behaviours, which presumably will affect both individual and organizational outcomes negatively. Research limitations/implications – The use of already collected, self-report data, single-item measures, and the two-year time lag could pose potential limitations to the study. Practical implications – Preventive and repair actions could potentially impact both negative acts and knowledge hoarding by focusing on increasing the social exchange quality at work unit level. Originality/value – This paper combines two strands of research, that of bullying at work and that of knowledge management, within which research on knowledge hoarding has been an under-researched area. © 2016, Authors.

After limited success and repeated failures in the implementation of regulation, Harry M. Trebing and others at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the late 1960s and 1970s revised and strengthened the model as well as the implementation capabilities of regulators, based on the regulatory weaknesses and unique opportunities for reform in the telecommunication industry. This model was then adapted to improve the regulation of other public utilities. Whereas the new model has also had limited success, the experience accumulated through it has prepared the ground for an inevitable third wave of regulatory reform. © 2016, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","Commons; dynamic regulation; FCC; IPU; NARUC; public interest; public utility regulation; Trebing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969141876

The main aim of this article is to analyse whether light sport facilities, as a distinct local level policy intervention, can contribute to the goals of attracting ‘light’ and/or new sports participants with public means. The study is carried out in the context of a particular case of running facilities (i.e. bark running tracks, BRTs) in Flanders. The use of BRTs is investigated by structured face-to-face interviews with runners at the location of the BRT (n = 546; RR = 98.8%). The profile of users of BRTs is elaborated based on users’ characteristics (whether or not one started to run due to the provision of a BRT, the frequency and intensity of using the BRT) in bivariate logistic regression analysis. Next, reasons for using BRTs are investigated. It is concluded that BRTs mainly serve as a facility of the fragmented individualised society by reaching a large share of light sports participants (86%). However, it has the ability to reach runners at different levels, who show different patterns of using BRTs. It is suggested that so-called silent expectations in light facilities may function differently for different types of users. In this view, findings are discussed in order to identify policy implications related to Sport for All. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","innovation; local sport policy; running; silent expectations; Sport facilities; sports participation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949186242

IA's trends of development and the characteristics of the public sector context, in fact, make IA inherently subject to multiple institutional forces that interact with the system of values and beliefs of individual internal auditors. The empirical analysis, which relies on case study methodology, highlights the inherent tensions associated with the changing role of IA and shows how different types of IA developed in three case settings, shaped by the agents’ embeddedness in different institutional fields. This article provides a more comprehensive approach to the study of IA adoption and development in public sector organizations than previous literature, and it highlights the relevance of the interplay between actors’ contemporary embeddedness in professional systems and the focal social system as a relevant source of practice variation. In this respect, the case of IA can contribute to previous studies of practice variation in the field of management accounting, shedding some light on the types of tensions that emerge when persons with mixed professional identities are involved in a field. © 2015 European Accounting Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924955567

In order to operate such systems efficiently, methods for reliable probabilistic forecasts of future wind power production are essential. It is well known that the conditional density of wind power production is highly dependent on the level of predicted wind power and prediction horizon. This paper describes a new approach for wind power forecasting based on logistic-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The SDE formulation allows us to calculate both state-dependent conditional uncertainties as well as correlation structures. Model estimation is performed by maximizing the likelihood of a multidimensional random vector while accounting for the correlation structure defined by the SDE formulation. We use non-parametric modelling to explore conditional correlation structures, and skewness of the predictive distributions as a function of explanatory variables.

Together, these spaces enable imaginative space, which is important for innovative and creative thinking. The Japanese concept of ma is proposed as a fruitful way of thinking about space in curricula not as wasteful, inefficient or a mere void to be filled but as the element that enables learning to result from exposing students to structures and content. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.","Creativity; curricular space; innovation; ma; management education; student experiences",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964746469

The findings are based upon a corpus of data including: a field study at the offices of the largest travel user-generated website, TripAdvisor and an adaptation of virtual ethnography called 'netnography'. In so doing, key insights are generated to inform organizational reputation-making. The paper concludes with the assertion that if we aim to understand the phenomenon of reputation-making, we have to develop a more nuanced and sophisticated way to conceptualize its formativeness. It is suggested that this extends beyond snap shot assessments or post hoc crisis management to an ongoing maintenance of the emergent and processual nature of reputation across the off-line and online spaces. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.","process; reputation management; travel sector; user-generated content",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964575532

By extending the main model with a communication stage, I also explore whether the differences in information that may follow from national intelligence gathering will be overcome by intelligence sharing.

Within Morgan’s list of images, that of ‘organization as flux and transformation’ stands out in two important regards. First, it has a strong metonymic dimension, as it implies that organizations consist of and are constituted by processes. Second, the image invites scholars to comprehend organizations as a paradoxical relation between organization (an entity) and process (a non-entity). In this article, we build on Morgan’s work and argue that flux-based images of organization vary in their ability to deal with the process-entity paradox, depending on the degree to which its metaphorical and metonymic dimensions are intertwined. We also examine three offsprings of the flux image: Organization as Becoming, Organization as Practice, and Organization as Communication. We compare these images regarding their metaphor–metonymy dynamics, the directionality of their process of imagination, and their degree of concreteness. We contribute to Morgan’s work, and to organization studies more generally, by offering an analytical grid for unpacking different processes of imagining organization. Moreover, our grid helps explain why images of organization vary in their ability to comprehend organizations in dialectical and paradoxical ways. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","flux image; metaphors; metonymies; organization theory; processes of imagination; process–entity paradox","controlled study; imagination; literature; organization; progeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962640056

The MCS framework of Malmi and Brown (2008) ensures a comprehensive understanding of SD enforcement in practice.We identify diverse types of controls that organizations use to enforce SD. Our findings problematize examples where the MCS is unable to appropriately address all relevant aspects of SD. We find that organizations prefer to manage and control smaller aspects of SD, such as environmental responsibility. Social responsibility is addressed less frequently, and only few organizations implement a sustainable MCS (SMCS) that addresses all aspects of SD. Classic 'cybernetic' controls are the preferred choice in MCS, but organizations have advanced beyond them during the past decade.Our main contribution is a structured map of contemporary research that points to areas where our understanding of SMCSs is still scarce, such as their interplay with contextual factors and the resulting, long-term performance effects. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Control; Corporate social responsibility; Literature review; Management control system; Management practice; Sustainability; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961179166

This study incorporates curiosity as a personal trait and NPD experience as a personal characteristic of the manager as moderating effects of the strategy implementation process of NPD. 131 NPD managers of Scandinavia SBUs participated in the study. Data were analysed using partial least squares regression. The study finds that managers influence the realised NPD strategy. NPD managers impose competence traps on strategy implementation. Curious NPD managers implementing aggressive strategic intentions create information overload in the NPD process, which decreases the new product novelty. In contrast, realisation of defensive strategic intentions makes experienced NPD managers focus on known NPD competences, thereby decreasing the new product novelty of NPD efforts. The study identified inadequately developed information competences among NPD managers. The result shows the importance of analysing how personal characteristics facilitate or hinder NPD strategy implementation.

Recent research has drawn attention to gradual policy changes unfolding over extended periods. One strategy of gradual change is layering, in which new policy dimensions are introduced by adding new policy instruments or by redesigning existing ones to address new concerns. The limited research on single-stage policy reforms highlights that these may not endure in the postenactment phase when circumstances change. We argue that gradual policy layering may create sustainability dynamics that can result in lasting reform trajectories. The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has changed substantially over the last three decades in response to emerging policy concerns by adding new layers.

Using a single case study approach (combining interview data, participant observation, internal and external documents, and literature), we examine the ethical potential of consuming fashion. We show how ethics in consumption is a critical engagement with how products such as clothes are bought and used, and understanding the value of the products we choose to buy.

It is shown that this inference does not follow under standard assumptions when accounting explicitly for service provision from both the private and public sectors.

We apply the learning perspective of internationalization theory to unpack what the firm learned in order to mobilize crowd-based knowledge to facilitate internationalization in the virtual context, and how it did so. Increasingly, global activities are conducted in virtual space and virtual markets and thus the paper offers insights into successful expansion in this new terrain. The findings highlight two key points: (1) the firm used cognitive/explicit learning to acquire external and codified knowledge, rather than the experiential knowledge traditionally suggested in the literature on the process of internationalization, and (2) the firm's success rested on its ability to use virtual learning tools and incentive systems to acquire, articulate and integrate knowledge from communities of internationally dispersed users - the ""crowd"" - to accelerate its internationalization in cyberspace.

When a market accepts a particular technology as one that defines the specifications for products in the entire industry, a dominant design is set. In this article, we investigate how the existence of a dominant design affects subsequent innovation in an industry. In particular, we study the influence on innovative performance, radical innovation, and process innovation. Analyzing longitudinal, cross-sectional patent data for more than 2.6 million patents filed from 1978 to 2013, we find support for our hypotheses that an industry's innovative performance and degree of radical innovation are negatively influenced by dominant design in that industry, and that process innovation is fostered by the occurrence of a dominant design. We discuss the findings in the light of the increasing speed of technological development and standardization. Additionally, results from a sensitivity analysis for different threshold values of dominant design call for adjusting a binary definition of dominant design with different threshold values depending on the effects under study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Generally, fixations are assigned to objects using a method known as area of interest (AOI). Ideally, an AOI includes all fixations belonging to an object while fixations to other objects are excluded. Unfortunately, due to measurement inaccuracy and insufficient distance between objects, the distributions of fixations to objects may overlap, resulting in a signal detection problem. If the AOI is to include all fixations to an object, it will also likely include fixations belonging to other objects (false positives). In a survey, we find that many researchers report testing multiple AOI sizes when performing analyses, presumably trying to balance the proportion of true and false positive fixations. To test whether AOI size influences the measurement of object attention and conclusions drawn about cognitive processes, we reanalyze four published studies and conduct a fifth tailored to our purpose. We find that in studies in which we expected overlapping fixation distributions, analyses benefited from smaller AOI sizes (0° visual angle margin). In studies where we expected no overlap, analyses benefited from larger AOI sizes (>.5° visual angle margins). We conclude with a guideline for the use of AOIs in behavioral eye-tracking research. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Areas of interest; Data fishing; Eye-tracking; Information processing; Signal detection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929598113

The explanatory power of routines is used to address open questions in the care pathway literature about their coordinating and organising role, the way they change and can be replicated, the way they are influenced by the organisation and the way they influence health care professionals. Design/methodology/approach – Theory of routines is systematically applied to care pathways in order to develop theoretically derived propositions. Findings – Care pathways mirror routines by being recurrent, collective and embedded and specific to an organisation. In particular, care pathways resemble standard operating procedures that can give rise to recurrent collective action patterns. In all, 11 propositions related to five categories are proposed by building on these insights: care pathways and coordination, change, replication, the organisation and health care professionals. Research limitations/implications – The paper is conceptual and uses care pathways as illustrative instances of hospital routines. The propositions provide a starting point for empirical research. Practical implications – The analysis highlights implications that health care professionals and managers have to consider in relation to coordination, change, replication, the way the organisation influences care pathways and the way care pathways influence health care professionals.

Design/methodology/approach – This paper’s approach is conceptual. The authors analyse the third mission and relevant literature on innovation systems and foresight to explain how and why foresight contributes to the third mission. Findings – The authors propose that foresight contributes to the third mission of universities, particularly to the research and development and innovation dimensions through the development of joint understanding of the agendas and future needs of stakeholders. In addition, foresight enables education to be designed to address identified needs. Research limitations/implications – The findings are both conceptual and exploratory in nature. Thus, the argument needs further examination through a broader study on foresight in the university–industry context and/or longitudinal research on the outcomes and impact of foresight in this context.

Universities must understand their role within the larger innovation system to fulfil the potential of economic development and by extension, their third mission. Originality/value – The paper outlines a novel approach of using ISF to promote university–industry partnerships and the growth of innovation systems. The paper also contributes to the discussion of the third mission by outlining that mission in practical terms. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Foresight; Innovation systems; Innovation systems foresight; Technology transfer; University third mission; University third stream",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960931021

Design/methodology/approach - This study takes inspiration from existing typologies depicting organisation-wide perspectives on diversity management, and articulates them in more detail by applying practice-driven indicators and highlighting possible contingent factors at play. The resulting framework is used to investigate diversity management in Italy. Data from a survey conducted among 90 companies and two focus groups with experts and managers are presented. Findings - The most common approach among Italian companies focuses on addressing social expectations, seemingly shaped by isomorphic pressures and the need to secure legitimacy in their environment. Results also point to an understanding and practice of diversity management in Italy that also incorporate compliance and opportunity-oriented aspects, in an interplay between coercion and voluntarism that reflects local perspective and priorities. Originality/value - This study makes an effort to address the paucity of studies linking approaches to managing diversity with managerial interventions and contextual factors. The research model connecting approaches with practice-driven aspects and explanatory factors shows descriptive and predictive potential, although it should be contextualised to the specific setting under investigation. This study also fills a research gap in Italy, where existing research primarily involves case studies and qualitative approaches and focuses on gender issues.

Museum projects and studies responding to this imperative have been frequent in recent years, but how does participation in museums unfold, and how can external partners’ contributions be evaluated and understood? Based on a practice-led and ethnographic study of a participatory collaborative design process in the Danish Museum of Rock Music,1 I argue that questions of how participation works – rather than how much and what type of participation is accomplished – should be asked when studying and reflexively planning for participatory collaborative processes in museums. Using a descriptive, symmetrical approach inspired by actor-network theory, this study exemplifies how tracing the relations between process and end product (e.g. digital tool or exhibition) reveals the contributions of a participatory process. This approach provides an understanding of participation as something that emerges relationally and sets directions for a museum project. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","co-production; digital design; diversity; museum controversy; Participation; study method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959866449

In particular, there has not yet been full agreement on the role and significance of gender differences in customer expectations and perceptions of responsible corporate conduct. An extensive review of the research on the subject reveals that the published studies have not dealt with the substantive significance of gender differences, and as a result, the size of such differences is unknown. The current study analyses both the statistical and the substantive significance of gender differences in customer expectations and perceptions of corporate responsibility, also examining the influence of age and education. The analysis is carried out on a remarkably large sample of 908 clients, pertaining to 12 of the largest Italian banks. The overall results show that there is a small substantive difference between women's and men's average expectations, with women showing higher average values than men. This result holds generally true with variation of education levels and age groups. Young females show the highest average values of expectations, and the significance of gender differences decreases with age. In contrast, the perception of corporate social responsibility does not show significant gender differences, either at the general level or when the analyses are repeated by education levels and age groups. The paper introduces the use of a standardized measure of effect size for analysing the substantive significance of gender differences in customer expectations and perceptions of corporate social responsibility. This novel approach increases results reliability and, accordingly, the effectiveness of company or policy maker strategies in designing, planning, implementing and assessing sustainability initiatives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Business ethics; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Customer perceptions and expectations; Effect size; Gender differences; Sustainability","Philosophical aspects; Sales; Sustainable development; Business ethics; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Customer perceptions; Effect size; Gender differences; Social sciences",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965112296

Of the total population of 5, 672 individuals, The number of participants amounted to 4, 162, leading to a response rate of 73.4 percent. Binary logistic regression analysis is used as a statistical method, and odds ratios and their corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals have been estimated. Findings - The level of social capital is fairly high in the municipality (3.75 on a five-point scale). Social capital is related to health (OR=0.420) and psychological distress (OR=0.282) but has an even stronger relationship to job satisfaction and commitment (OR is 9.889 and 7.800, respectively). The study contributes with the conclusion that different sub-dimensions of social capital are related to health and job related outcomes. Therefore, managers need to be specific about what exactly they want to achieve with the implementation of social capital in municipalities.

We discuss the agents for change against a background of evolving national and regional gastronomy. From this example, we address innovation and change in food developed in various regions of the UK. Producers from two distinct regions have very different food histories and socio-economic characteristics: the South West and the West Midlands. In the South West, producers draw on a rich food heritage to adapt products to meet the demands of ethnically diversifying UK consumers; in the West Midlands (one of the already most ethnically diverse areas of the UK), rural fresh produce growers are striving to meet the challenge of change in response to the major conurbation on their doorstep. The chapter concludes with the recognition that evolving markets and regional and national gastronomies create the impetus for product innovation, but both producer and market can be hampered by channel and cultural disconnection. Actors in the processes and channels of production and supply must understand one another and unite in the service of new and emerging markets to best meet the burgeoning needs of ethnically diverse customers. © Taylor & Francis Adam Lindgreen and Martin K.

This process of politicization is revealed here through a case study of an intervention that provides sporting activities in holiday periods for migrant children and adolescents living in so-called socially disadvantaged areas (DGI Playground). The analysis highlights the rationality that the leisure time of migrant youth is a potentially dangerous time slot and they must be engaged in organized sports; that is not only healthy but also civilizing and character forming leisure time activities. Techniques of monitoring the intervention are developed in a partnership between public institutions, regional umbrella organizations and local sports clubs leading to a need for employment of welfare professionals. Furthermore, the article illustrates that in the discursive construction of subject positions for the target group, migrant youth tend to become clients and recipients of public services rather than potential members of civil sports clubs. These findings are supported by ethnographic interviews with participants that show how youngsters who took part in DGI Playground were able to reflect the official aim of the programme and relate this to their desire to have fun and hang out with their friends.

The research reveals that the buying and the selling functions have different prioritisations on the majority of the determined critical success measuring criteria. These criteria are categorised into three Critical Success Measuring Criteria Groups, for the selling and the buying functions, respectively, guiding medical supply chain members in harnessing the full advantage of a BBECS. For the selling function, the top critical success measuring criteria are as follows: integrating information searching/transmission and application processes, ensuring the reliability and timeliness of technical support, ensuring recognition and acceptance of e-commerce processes, displaying the organisation's business focus and product/service provisions online, securing a large scale/amount of business transactions, adjusting production outputs and inventory levels and having more registered users than competitors do. The top critical success measuring criteria for the buying function are as follows: securing the establishment of business relationships between businesses, displaying the measures ensuring mutual trust and cooperation online, ensuring employees' recognition of the benefit of e-commerce in increasing revenue, ensuring the contribution to the development and realisation of corporate strategy, achieving cost reduction for the organisation, making the purchase of famous brand products available/doable, securing a large scale/amount of business transactions, and ensuring the attainability of products/services at a lower price. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","B2B e-commerce system; China; performance; prioritisation; success measuring criteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957843318

However, even an efficiently integrated shift introduces a number of trade-offs due to the contradictory goals that emerge from that businesss economical, environmental and social dimensions. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective mixed integer mathematical problem for a generic closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network to rationalise how a systems product recovery helps to improve manufacturing sustainability. The CLSC network proposed in this study consists of a hybrid manufacturing facility, warehouse, distribution centres, collection centres and a hybrid recovery facility (HRF). The proposed model determines the best location for the HRF and optimal flow of products, recovered parts and material in the network while it simultaneously maximises profit, saves activity costs, helps to decrease the harmful effects of the manufacturing process and makes a positive impact on societal development. To validate the model, a numerical illustration with the help of a case study from an electrical manufacturing industry is offered. The results authenticate the approach of the model towards the fulfilment of various environmental regulations. A sensitivity analysis, completed on demand, and the return rate also assists decision-makers to manage their decisions with a broader insight towards manufacturing sustainability. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","closed-loop supply chain management; manufacturing sustainability; product recovery; societal development; trade-offs","Commerce; Computer system recovery; Decision making; Environmental regulations; Manufacture; Recovery; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Warehouses; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain management; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Manufacturing facility; Manufacturing industries; Product recovery; societal development; Trade off; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945232561

Politics and research has focused on the supply-side of the labor market, that is, regulating the rights and obligations of the target groups of ALMPs (mainly unemployed and inactive persons). The role and behavior of employers is under-researched and under-theorized in the vast literature on ALMPs and industrial relations. In this article, we analyze ALMPs from the employers' perspective by examining the determinants of firms' participation in providing wage subsidy jobs for the unemployed. First, we examine the historical background to the introduction and development of wage subsidy schemes as an important ALMP instrument in Denmark. Second, we derive theoretical arguments and hypotheses about employers' participation in ALMPs from selected theories. Third, we use data from a survey of Danish firms conducted in 2013 to characterize the firms that are engaged in implementing wage subsidy jobs and hypotheses are tested using a binary logistical regression to establish why firms voluntarily engage in reintegrating unemployed back into the labor market. We find that the firms which are most likely to participate in the wage subsidy scheme are characterized by many unskilled workers, a higher coverage of collective agreements, a deteriorating economic situation, a Danish ownership structure, and are especially found in the public sector. This shows that the preference formation of firms is more complex than scholars often assume. © 2016 Roskilde University.","Active labor market policies; Firms, wage subsidy; Implementation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034732195

The prevailing interpretation of agency theory argues that managers compete in an annual tournament for capital inflows. However, behavioral economics provides an alternative explanation for these risk preferences Fund managers who are below their benchmarks are risk seeking (and vice versa) because they cannot bear finishing below the median. This is independent of monetary incentives. The authors' experiment removes all capital inflow incentives to eliminate the foundation of the agency theory explanation. Yet, the tournament phenomenon persists Non-risk-neutral subjects increase risk after bad relative performance, but decrease risk after bad absolute performance. Whereas agency theory would label the authors' observations as anomalies, behavioral economics explains the persistence of the tournament phenomenon quite well - by viewing it as an internal conflict, rather than an agency conflict.

Specifically, we analyzed the effects on community members' perceived goal instrumentality of social network brand communities (i.e., whether the community increases the likelihood that personal goals will be achieved) and active participation in these brand communities. The results of a field study and three laboratory experiments reveal that nWOM evokes more negative consumer reactions in social-goal communities than in functional-goal communities. However, pWOM evokes more positive consumer reactions in social-goal communities than in functional-goal communities.

Yet, there is a paucity of studies that investigates how such failures manifest on e-commerce websites and their impact on consumers. This paper, therefore, synthesizes extant literature on e-service and system success to arrive at a novel classification system that delineates e-commerce service failures into information, functional, and system categories, each with its own set of constituent dimensions. Extending expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT), we further distinguish among disconfirmed outcome, process, and cost expectancies as major consequences of e-commerce service failures. A theoretical model of e-commerce service failure classifications and their consequences was constructed together with testable propositions that relate the three failure categories to consumers' disconfirmed expectancies. Finally, we explore the validity of our theoretical model based on descriptive accounts of actual occurrences of e-commerce service failures and their corresponding consequences. Consistent with our theoretical model, information and functional failures were found to be associated with disconfirmed outcome and process expectancies respectively. System failures, on the other hand, do not affect consumers' disconfirmed expectancies, thereby contradicting our predictions. Post hoc analysis on constituent dimensions of information, functional, and system failures yielded additional insights on the preceding observations.","Critical incident technique (CIT); Disconfirmed cost expectancy; Disconfirmed outcome expectancy; Disconfirmed process expectancy; E-commerce service failure; Expectation disconfirmation theory; Functional failure; Information failure; Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA); System failure","Classification (of information); Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Job analysis; Systems engineering; Critical incident technique; Disconfirmed cost expectancy; Disconfirmed outcome expectancy; Disconfirmed process expectancy; E-commerce services; Expectation disconfirmation theory; Functional failure; Qualitative comparative analysis; System failures; Electronic commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961843704

The aim of the project was to improve the professional skills and engagement of the care workers and to improve the life quality and participation of the residents. Furthermore, the idea was that the project could strengthen a public and professional discourse about more democratic and inclusive alternatives (for staff as well as residents) to the currently growing bureaucracy and expansion of top-down control systems in elder care. The project was inspired by critical utopian action research with future workshops as an important methodological tool. The project followed the core characteristics of action research to be “a shared commitment to democratic social change”. The article discusses how the project contributed to changes in care quality in a joint effort between care workers, residents at the nursing home, and researchers. It concludes that the project led to empowerment of the residents and staff and played an important role in the development of democratic knowledge building about better quality and ethics in elder care. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","critical utopian action research; Elder care; empowerment; future workshop; nursing homes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960078935

Contrary to the prescriptions of the performance management doctrine, the analysis shows a clear increase in the number of rules. This reflects the creation of many new rules about performance measurement without a proportionate repeal of production rules constraining the autonomy of public service providers and their managers.

The purpose of this article is to reconstruct the notion of the dispositive as a key conception in Foucault’s thought, particularly in his lectures at the Collège de France, and to develop dispositional analytics with specific reference to matters of organization. Foucault’s dispositional analysis articulates a history of interrelated social technologies that have been constructed to organize how we relate to each other. The article distinguishes various dispositional prototypes. It shows how dispositional analytics leads the way beyond general periodizations and established dichotomies such as the either-or of the discursive and non-discursive, power and freedom, determinism, and agency; and it demonstrates how dispositional analytics can contribute to a more complex understanding of organizational dynamics, power, strategy, resistance, and critique.

Thick contracts include a clause specifying that the licensors are obligated to assist the licensees in assimilating and integrating the technology. Drawing on a sample of 133 licensees and an equal number of matched nonlicensees, we present empirical evidence that thick contracts propel the licensees' likelihood of introducing new inventions. It is also found that thick contracts act as a substitute for licensees' absorptive capacity. Licensees that are more familiar with the licensed technology are in less need of assistance from the licensors to assimilate and integrate the knowledge. However, this substitution effect is neutralized once the hurdle of invention has been overcome, meaning that the licensees have succeeded to ignite the invention process, suggesting the exploitation of the learning curve, triggered by their mutual understanding. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957852122

However, we also show that this effect deteriorates over time, suggesting that the adoption of management accounting systems is a source of temporary rather than sustainable competitive advantage.

To identify the behavioral and neural responses mediating framing of social interactions, participants underwent functional MRI while playing a prisoner's dilemma game. In separate neuroimaging sessions, the game was either framed as a cooperation game or a competition game. The framing of social decisions engaged the hippocampal formation, precuneus, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, and lateral temporal gyrus. Among these regions, the engagement of the left hippocampus was further modulated by individual differences in empathy. Social decisions not adhering to the frame were associated with stronger engagement of the angular gyrus and trend increases in lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior intraparietal cortex, and temporopolar cortex.

However, even a relatively low number of dimensions in future conditions can lead to hundreds or even thousands of plausible future scenarios. Creating highly diverse but conceivable visions of the future in which to explore decision-making, exploratory futures techniques rely on the selection of a small number of plausible scenarios from the larger set. In this paper we describe a new method for finding maximally diverse sets containing a small number of plausible scenarios from a multi-dimensional morphological analysis. It is based on a mathematical optimization of diversity that is robust to the uncertainty in the framing of future factors and states and in what stakeholders might consider diverse combinations of those factors and states.

It shows that while lower middle-income countries typically import solar PV equipment into CDM projects, China, India and Thailand have begun to use new organizational arrangements for technology transfer which reflect the overall industry maturity in the solar PV sectors in these countries. This has great potential for long-term climate change mitigation efforts. However, the initiation of these new organizational arrangements often preceded the supply of technology into CDM projects. This raises important questions about the role of CDM in spearheading the development of technological capabilities required for sustainable development. The paper uses these findings to add to the literature about technology in CDM and to the wider policy debates over the future of the global climate regime. Technology transfer does not become less important as developing countries' capabilities mature, but the nature of technology transfer changes over time. This suggests a need to differentiate between countries at different levels of development.

However, in recent years, ordoliberal principles appear to have been replaced by neoliberalism and efficiency-enhancing rationale in EU competition policy.

Recently, such sharing activity has grown from information and media content to wider resources, including money, physical goods and services - coined collaborative consumption. Sustainability is often cited as a key driver, underpinned by economic, social and environmental benefits. If successful, the sharing of such resources is likely to have a potentially disruptive impact on incumbents in traditional supply chains. However, given the embryonic state of its development, it is perhaps not surprising that collaborative consumption is not well understood in research or practice. With this in mind, this study undertook a four-stage Delphi study with 25 experts in order to identify the key drivers, inhibitors and likely future developments in collaborative consumption over the next 10 years. A key finding was that environmental concern (sustainability) was considered of minor importance.

Analyzing a sample of 942 children in 42 school classes, we show that pyramiding, a search process based on personal references from user to user, is significantly more efficient in identifying rare individuals than screening, even though many references are not based on close personal relations. Pyramiding's relative efficiency advantage increases with the size of the population being searched.

Hitherto disparate sets of historical evidence on how Red Scare tactics influenced social researchers and marketing scientists are brought together and updated with evidence from original archival research. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on the existing secondary literature on how social research practitioners and social scientists reacted to the unusually high pressures on academic freedom during the McCarthy era. It supplements this review with evidence obtained from archival research, including declassified FBI files. The focus of this paper is set on prominent individuals, mainly Bernard Berelson, Samuel Stouffer, Hadley Cantril, Robert S. Lynd, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Herta Herzog, Ernest Dichter, but also the Frankfurt School in exile. Findings – Although some of the historiography presents American social scientists and practitioners in the marketing research sector as victims of McCarthyism and FBI surveillance, it can also be shown that virtually all individuals in focus here also developed strategies of accommodation, compromise and even opportunism to benefit from the climate of suspicion brought about by the prevailing anti-Communism. Social implications – Anyone interested in questions about the morality of marketing, market research and opinion polling as part of the social sciences practiced in vivo will need to pay attention to the way these social-scientific practices became tarnished by the way prominent researchers accommodated and at times even abetted McCarthyism. Originality/value – Against the view of social scientists as harassed academic minority, evidence is presented in this paper which shows American social scientists who researched market-related phenomena, like media, voters choices and consumer behaviour, in a different light. Most importantly, this paper for the first time presents archival evidence on the scale of Paul F. Lazarsfeld’s surveillance by the FBI. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cold War; Communism; FBI; Loyalty boards; McCarthy era; Paul F.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors use mixed methods consisting of in-depth interviews and a survey of 100 incubatees in order to study entrepreneurs within a specific incubator programme called the Growth Factories located in Region Zealand, Denmark. Findings – The authors find that there are significant differences in the perceived benefit of various business incubator elements for incubatees depending on their entrepreneurial characteristics. Research limitations/implications – Future studies are particularly important in order to learn which elements provide the different kinds of entrepreneurs with a critical factor in determining their success or failure. Practical/implications – The conclusions have importance for regional government and development managers aiming at designing new business incubators. The authors suggest that in order to enhance the effect of incubator programmes they must be tailor-made to the individual entrepreneur. Originality/value – Previous studies have either tended to treat incubator programmes as a uniform entity, where all entrepreneurs receive the same service, or they have treated all entrepreneurs as a uniform group, even though it is well known that entrepreneurs vary considerably in their characteristics.

But unlike in developed nations, developing countries encounter struggle with the implementation of auto parts remanufacturing due to hidden facts. Many researchers have explored such hidden facts in auto parts remanufacturing in developing nations and their emerging economies. However, there is a huge gap in the state-of-the-art remanufacturing practices in India, despite India's strong advancements in the automobile industry. In fact, India's automobile industry is rapidly approaching that of China's in recent years. Although some studies are available regarding remanufacturing implementation, current research has generally failed to offer a deep analysis of the factors and barriers that exist as hurdles to such implementation. Consequently, this paper attempts to investigate the essential barrier to auto parts remanufacturing in an Indian scenario, and we also address vital interrelationships and interdependencies. To achieve the aim of the study, a model framework is proposed and applied to an Indian case industry. The data obtained from the case industry is processed with two solution methodologies: namely, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and analytic network process (ANP). To avoid inaccuracies and vagueness in results, the data are manipulated under a fuzzy environment. This study reveals results which show that higher cost and lack of customer acceptance are the essential and most influential barriers in auto parts remanufacturing in an Indian scenario. This study contributes to society by assisting closed loop supply chain players to identify and eliminate the barriers to remanufacturing within the scope of the Indian sector. Finally, this paper provides a brief road map and insights into future research for remanufacturing specifically in an Indian context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Automotive parts; Cleaner production; Emerging economies; Fuzzy ANP; Indian remanufacturing; ISM","Amphibious vehicles; Automobiles; Automotive industry; Conservation; Decision theory; Developing countries; Fuzzy logic; Pollution control; Supply chains; Automotive parts; Cleaner production; Emerging economies; Fuzzy ANP; Indian remanufacturing; ISM; Linear matrix inequalities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938118040

Different from the traditional development mode which merely relocating industries outside of the cities for pursuing sustainable development, eco-industrial development makes significant innovation by treating or utilizing wastes (i.e. solid wastes and waste energy) in a smart way for local industries to achieve a win-win situation. In order to investigate the eco-benefits of eco-industrial development in China, this study focused on an industrial and urban symbiosis case of Guiyang city in which process synergy, municipal solid wastes recycling and waste energy utilization were incorporated in this typical industrial city. This city is resource-dependent, has many heavy industries, and these severely hinder sustainable development in this city. In order to promote eco-industrial development, an integrated coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban symbiosis network was firstly designed, with linkages between various industries through energy exchanges and process synergies. Subsequently, a quantitative assessment on the life cycle environmental benefits were further conducted. Then, we found that a dramatic resource saving and carbon dioxide emission reduction can be achieved. Finally, some policy implications to address the barriers of promoting industrial and urban symbiosis were proposed.

Our EC research project developed a method for whole-system assessment of eco-innovation with multi-stakeholder cooperation. In three cases presented here, tensions arise among various aims, resource burdens, system levels, beneficiaries and timescales, thus complicating the concept of eco-innovation as a win–win strategy. Radical eco-innovation would depend on extra functions, value-chain actors and resource usages which can provide greater overall benefits. But such investment faces many systemic obstacles. Eco-innovation remains path dependent, thus limiting the scope to internalise environmental externalities.

One consequence of this is that nurses' work in hospitals is increasingly standardized through medical evidence. Using Bourdieu's theory of practice in combination with an ethnographic field study, it is analyzed how the nurses of a Danish Integrated Emergency Department respond to the changing conditions of work. It is illuminated how two opposing approaches to nursing of humanistically and pluralistically oriented caring, and evidence-based scientifically oriented curing inform nursing in the department. The curing approach is however trumping the caring approach. Curing creates new nursing career pathways and is by some nurses embraced with enthusiasm. For others, the new situation creates tension and distress. It is illustrated how the nurses position their practice in relation to the changing working conditions taking sides for either curing or caring, or finding a way to maneuver in between the two. The article argues that the normative enforcement of the curing approach may carry unintended side effects to the goals of quality and efficiency enhancements. © 2016 Roskilde University.","Caring; Curing; Healthcare reform; Hospital; Medical evidence; NPM; Nursing; Standardization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045298053

We illustrate how the enforcement of standardization upsets the balance between the humanistic and medical aspects of psychiatry as a discipline and field of practice, and show how this development challenges professional identities, interdisciplinary collaboration and hierarchical relations. The development is however negotiated, reformulated, and opposed, in teams of mental health professionals. In this context of increasing standardization, highly skilled emotional labor unfolds. We point out how acceleration and leaning of work procedures increases the emotional labor in relation to clients, partners, and colleagues. But paradoxically, at the same time, emotional labor becomes still more invisible as it is excluded from the standardized schemes. The study illustrates the crucial role of emotional labor in mental care work and points out how it is left to the professionals to negotiate paradoxes and make ends meet. © 2016 Roskilde University.","Emotional labor; Interdisciplinary work; Psychiatry; Standardization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044871342

Yet, there is a paucity of research which explore the links between governance and sustainability. This paper attempts to address this research need by providing an analysis of the role of governance in enabling - and to some extent - fostering a transition towards sustainable societies. A set of indicators for assessing the capacity for and willingness and commitment to transition to a more sustainable society is presented, enabling identification of direction of change. This paper presents the results of a study, in the context of which sustainability governance has been comparatively investigated in a sample of European countries with, by methodological purpose, very different economic, environmental, political and social conditions (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland). Lessons learnt and examples of good practice - which may be replicable elsewhere-are outlined. For instance, it is discussed that limited knowledge about sustainable development amongst municipal development planners and decision-makers, deficiencies in policy integration, intersectoral cooperation, municipality and stakeholder cooperation and urban management practices are major reasons for weak governance practices in sustainable development. Furthermore, some recommendations on the role of sustainability governance are made, so as to allow the integration of the principles of governance into sustainability practice and hence provide a more general basis upon which a transition towards sustainable societies may become a reality in different types of European countries and societies. The scientific value of this paper lies in identifying opportunities for integrating principles of governance into sustainability practice, as well as outlining the basis for sustainability transitions, providing a general picture of required policy measures. The paper offers a unique comparative analysis of sustainability governance in the Baltic Sea countries, outlining some of the challenges in sustainability governance in the Baltic Sea region. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings demonstrate how public managers construct old and new roles related to various public management discourses, and their struggles to change accordingly. However, the findings also show how managers empower their new role and gain agency to steer collaborative outcomes. Thereby the article unpacks the challenges of becoming a facilitating manager alongside other roles: the struggles of identity and agency constitutive to particular ways of managing, as well as struggles over multiple roles.

The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to provide a detailed elaboration of the indigenous Eastern epistemological system of Yin-Yang balancing in contrast to the Western logic systems; and second, to provide a roadmap for applying the system of Yin-Yang balancing to complex issues in the area of management, in general, and paradoxical issues, in particular. Design/methodology/approach - This is a conceptual paper with a focus on theory-building. Findings - The author elaborates on the indigenous features of Yin-Yang balancing, in contrast to Aristotle's formal logic and Hegel's dialectical logic in the West, to further explore the former's global implications for the increased attention to research on paradox management. In particular, the author posits that Yin-Yang balancing appears to be better suited for paradox management than the more commonly used logics available in the Western literature. Built upon the Yin-Yang balancing, a practical tool of Duality Map for paradox management is proposed. Research limitations/implications - The system of Yin-Yang balancing proposed in this paper has the potential to embrace logical systems available in the West into a geocentric (East-meeting-West) meta-system. This paper further shows how to apply Yin-Yang balancing with the tool of Duality Map to the most salient paradoxes in the domain of management, including value-profit balance (triple bottom lines), exploration-exploitation balance (ambidexterity), cooperation-competition balance (co-opetition), globalization-localization balance (glocalization), institution-agency balance (institutional entrepreneurship), simultaneously positive and negative attitudes toward an entity (ambivalence), and etic-emic balance (geocentric) across all domains of management research. Originality/value - The primary challenge for management researchers is to find a way to achieve a geocentric integration between the West and the East at the fundamental level of philosophy. The hope is that the philosophical traditions in the East will facilitate such integration. In particular, the Eastern philosophy of wisdom has a unique capacity to reframe paradox from a negative problem (i.e. a problem of inconsistency to be resolved by dualism in terms of separating opposite elements) to a positive solution (i.e. a solution of completeness or holism to be achieved by duality in terms of partially separating and partially integrating opposite elements). © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Duality; Indigenous research; Paradox; West-meeting-East; Yin-Yang balancing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016336175

These policies and regulations may also be used by the state to directly change social conditions in national contexts, including in cluster settings, in order to further the government's overall economic strategy.

Three eye-tracking studies explore decision processes in conjoint choices that take less time and become more accurate with practice. These studies reveal two simplification processes that are associated with greater speed and reliability. Alternative focus gradually shifts attention toward options that represent promising choices, whereas attribute focus directs attention to important attributes that are most likely to alter or confirm a decision. Alternative and attribute focus increase in intensity with practice. In terms of biases, the authors detect a small but consistent focus on positive aspects of the item chosen and negative aspects of the items not chosen. They also show that incidental exposures arising from the first-examined alternative or from alternatives in a central horizontal location increase attention but have a much more modest and often insignificant impact on conjoint choices. Overall, conjoint choice is found to be a process that is (1) largely formed by goal-driven values that respondents bring to the task and (2) relatively free of distorting effects from task layout or random exposures. © 2016, American Marketing Association.","Choice models; Conjoint; Eye tracking; Goal-driven processes; Incidental exposure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969593745

This common assumption aims to focus on specific characteristics of the empirical probability distribution of such data (e.g., its scale-free nature or its long/fat tail). This assumption, however, may not be always true. Motivated by recent work in the statistical treatment of power law claims, we investigate two research questions: (i) To what extent do power law approximations hold for term frequency, document length, query frequency, query length, citation frequency, and syntactic unigram frequency? And (ii) what is the computational cost of replacing ad hoc power law approximations with more accurate distribution fitting? We study 23 TREC and 5 non-TREC datasets and compare the fit of power laws to 15 other standard probability distributions. We find that query frequency and 5 out of 24 term frequency distributions are best approximated by a power law. All remaining properties are better approximated by the Inverse Gaussian, Generalized Extreme Value, Negative Binomial, or Yule distribution. We also find the overhead of replacing power law approximations by more informed distribution fitting to be negligible, with potential gains to IR tasks like index compression or test collection generation for IR evaluation. © 2016 ACM.","Power laws; Statistical model selection","Information retrieval; Computational costs; Distribution fitting; Generalized extreme value; Power law distribution; Power-law; Research questions; Statistical modeling; Statistical treatment; Probability distributions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84968909097

This article seeks to give a descriptive status quo of this current development in Danish municipalities in 2014. In doing so, the article describes the national status on city branding in Denmark with a particular focus on political involvement and leadership. From a dialog with 72 municipalities (out of a total of 98), 38 site interviews were performed with CEOs and/or brand managers and 25 brand projects isolated. In this regard, four questions were in the focus: (i) reasons for the branding initiative; (ii) the underlying place development strategy; (iii) the issue of project ownership; and (iv) project funding. A special emphasis was given on the political leadership of those projects. Data indicates that most projects were developed in narrow political circles including mayors, councils, municipal CEOs and semi-public organizations. This is because of the reason, that Danish mayors have the political as well as the formal administrative responsibility for the municipality. Thus, the data supports the view that local mayors and politicians in a Danish context act from a shareholder's perspective.

In this paper, we explored how employees with different lengths of tenure within the research and development (R&D) department of a company in the automotive industry answer this question. We found that the needs vary depending on the length of the employee's tenure. New employees view innovation as an organisational work issue and employees with longer tenure seek the support of management in changing the work situation themselves in a way that will enhance innovation. In contrast, employees who have been with the company over 10 years show signs of resignation and blame management for the problems around innovation that they experience. However, one opinion that all groups of different tenures share is that there is not enough time to engage in innovation activities. To address some of these different needs, we suggest viewing productivity as a cycle of two outcomes: product information and knowledge creation. When one is low, the other peaks, and vice versa. This view of dual value creation in R&D is one way to bypass the productivity dilemma. © 2016 Imperial College Press.","industrial innovation; Motivation fatigue; productivity dilemma; text analytic method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959133752

This is the very focus of this research, which is based on data collected by identical surveys of industrial companies in Denmark over a number of years. The results indicate a slightly increasing involvement over time, but also that the level of results achieved is lower than the level of initiatives taken. That is, the reactive attitude reported previously still seems to be prevailing.

But do users know that Facebook analyses everything they type and not publish? We (users) spend a lot of time considering what to post on Facebook. Should I argue that political point my friend has made? Should I comment on a friend's status? Do my friends need to see yet another picture of my pet or baby? Most of us have, at one point or another, started typing something and then regretted it and deleted the post. However, the code in our browser that powers Facebook remembers what we typed, even though we decide to delete it. This means that posts we explicitly choose not to share are not entirely private. Facebook calls these unpublished posts ""self-censorship"". A recent paper written by two Facebookers reveals how Facebook monitors and uses such unpublished thoughts. The question is whether this practice is covered by the Facebook Data Use Policy? The policy does not refer explicitly if Facebook manage self-censorship behavior. Moreover, while Facebook does not consider this practice a privacy violation, I argue that it clearly raises privacy and data protection issues. Under EU law, personal data can only be gathered legally under strict conditions, for a legitimate purpose. In this article I will analyse, using Facebook's self-censorship practices as an example, whether this practice is consistent with EU data protection law. © 2015 Evelyne J.B.

Policy is developed to protect athletes' right to participate in doping-free sport; and testing is a key tool to secure this right. Accordingly, athletes' responses to anti-doping efforts are important. This article explores how the International Standards for Testing, which face different interpretations and challenges when policy is implemented, are perceived by elite athletes. Particularly, this article aims to investigate how elite athletes perceive the functioning of the testing system (i.e., the efforts of stakeholders involved in testing) in their own sport both nationally and worldwide. Moreover, it seeks to identify whether specific factors such as previous experience of testing and perceived proximity of doping have an impact on athletes' perceptions of the testing system. The study comprises a web-based questionnaire (N = 645; response rate 43%) and uses qualitative findings to elaborate on and explain quantitative results. Results showed that two-thirds of the athletes reported the national testing programme in their sport to be appropriate. A majority of the athletes who had an opinion on the subject regarded testing programmes in some countries as not extensive enough or believed that in certain countries doping control was downgraded to win medals. Past experience of testing seemed to have a positive influence on trust in the concrete measures; however, if athletes experienced flaws during the control procedures, this could increase distrust and cause worry. The proximity of doping in an athlete's sport influenced the athlete's perception of the testing system. Particularly, athletes who need the testing system to be effective and to function well across the world show greater distrust of or dissatisfaction with the current testing system. The athletes' diverging views indicate that contemporary anti-doping policy is simultaneously met with support, (dis)trust and frustration. By integrating the views and experiences of Danish elite athletes, this study confirms that the current testing system is confronted with obstacles, and it contributes knowledge about some of the challenges WADA faces when policy is implemented. Implications of results and recommendations for anti-doping authorities are outlined in the paper. © 2015.","Anti-doping policy; Deterrence; Elite athletes; Interviews; Survey; World Anti-Doping Code",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957455405

Pursuing either open or closed inbound innovation alone may result in an imbalance between potential AC and realized AC as well as inward-looking AC and outward-looking AC, which will hinder innovative performance.

Findings – Interviewees acknowledge the relevance of the cultural backgrounds of employees in relation to internal communication, especially in crisis situations. Cultural aspects affect message framing and employee sensemaking, especially when it comes to employees located in other countries. Line managers and local communicators are key in the adaptation of verbal and non-verbal communicative features. Employees are also seen as active sensegivers and communicators. Research limitations/implications – Findings show how demographic and globalisation patterns, which are changing domestic and international workplaces, have important implications for internal communication and internal crisis communication. There is therefore a call for further research, especially from the perspective of employees. Originality/value – Although cultural aspects have been highlighted as a recurrent feature of most crises today, and one of the new research areas to be explored, studies within this area are very few and concern mainly external audiences and practices.

Findings – The findings suggest that news agencies reframe earnings releases at the textual-pragmatic level by reducing their length, using fewer financial figures, and changing the position of these figures in the texts; they increase transparency by avoiding adjusted financial figures, qualifying figures, and adding analyst assessments; and they change the tonality by down-toning positive statements and highlighting negative aspects.

The authors investigate the motivations of diverse stakeholders (including shareholders) in fostering the adoption of standards and guidelines for CSR after IR became mandatory in Denmark. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conduct a case study at the Danish carpet manufacturer EGE. The authors interpret the case from the perspective of pragmatic constructivism, which focuses on the integration of four dimensions: facts, possibilities, values, and communication. Findings – The authors find that the family-owned EGE follows a strategy of “enlightened shareholder value,” in which CSR is an essential value driver. This strategy fostered IR with guidelines and standards for CSR. The CSR practices appeared to be helpful for integrating measureable plans to the strategy and for controlling CSR implementation. However, the long and technical CSR reports did not effectively communicate EGE’s values and possibilities. The authors outline how EGE overcame these barriers. Originality/value – The authors suggest that IR implementation depends on the context, and the authors explain why the case company has opted to issue two separate reports for their IR. In addition, the authors suggest that standardized approaches to CSR may be suitable for internal planning and control purposes; however, companies must go beyond these measurements to achieve IR. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Critical management studies; Integrated reporting; Knowledge communication; Pragmatic constructivism; Shareholder value",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957066900

The objective is to minimize fuel consumption while retaining the customer transit times including the transhipment times. To avoid too many changes to the time table, changes of port berth times are only accepted if they lead to savings above a threshold value. Since the fuel consumption of a vessel is a non-linear convex function of the speed, it is approximated by a piecewise linear function. The developed model is solved using exact methods in less than two minutes for large instances. Computational experiments on real-size liner shipping networks are presented showing that fuels savings in the magnitude 2-10% can be obtained.

Both are based on a holistic view of risks. Hence, risks related to specific functions within a company must be considered more broadly than previously. Risks, however, involve uncertainty, and the less specific the context in which risks are viewed, the more uncertainty will be involved. One particular way to express uncertainty is through trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TrIFNs). In this paper, risks that are relevant for supplier risk assessments are first collected from the literature. Then it is illustrated how the multi-criteria decision analysis method ELECTRE TRI-C can be used for sorting suppliers into risk categories, when the risks as well as some of the method's parameters are expressed with TrIFNs. In order to do this, we make use of a small modification of an existing method for converting TrIFNs into crisp values. The approach is illustrated in a case problem based on a company that is looking for service providers (suppliers) of electrical maintenance. The problem involves 20 suppliers that are sorted into three risk categories based on evaluations from 27 criteria. Results from the case study point to two low risk suppliers. A further ad-hoc analysis suggests one of these to be less risky than the other. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach – Two books on African management are interpreted using anthropological and sociological theory as the analytical perspective. Findings – The analysis of the two works suggests that the preindustrial patterns described in the anthropological literature play a central role in African management and business. Practical implications – The paper concludes that manager should recognize the negative effects that may follow from a rejection of these socio-cultural patterns of behaviour. Originality/value – It introduces Marshall Sahlins’ theory of social distance and reciprocity showing how this theory explains behaviours in and between African organizations. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","African management; Anthropology; Culture; Gifts; In group out group; Kinship; Qualitative",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954432377

However, predominant empirical operationalizations and their theoretical underpinnings assume psychic distances to be symmetric. Building on insights from psychology and sociology, this paper demonstrates how national factors and cognitive processes interact in the formation of asymmetric distance perceptions. The results suggest that exposure to other countries through emigrants and imports of cultural goods and services have asymmetric effects on psychic distance perceptions. The size of these effects appears to vary with the size of the home country - smaller countries tend, on average, to perceive psychic distances to the rest of the world as smaller than do bigger ones. The reputational status of target countries relative to that of the home country is found to have a non-linear, asymmetric effect on distance perceptions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Asymmetry; Cultural distance; Distance cognition; Psychic distance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953366672

The NPM reforms are expected to formalize and professionalize strategy processes and strategy content towards greater competitiveness, but this may counter cooperation between organizations, which is essential in many areas for overall service provision. Research has provided little empirical knowledge about the simultaneous competition and cooperation in the public sector. This study offers such knowledge via a panel case study of five Danish upper secondary schools over a ten-year period during a large NPM reform. The study includes three rounds of interviews with school principals before, during and after the reform, combined with secondary data. The study shows that, during reform implementation, strategy processes become more formalized and professionalized, and that teachers, in particular, lose influence. Regarding strategy content, the authors find an increase in external focus and competition, though schools maintain a focus on cooperation. The results suggest that NPM reforms can significantly change strategic management in public organizations, and that this is not necessarily at the expense of cooperation, at least in the short run. © 2016 British Academy of Management.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953260257

Listed SOEs' strategies will thus be more similar to those of wholly privately owned enterprises (POEs) when these controls are more effective. Building on Williamson's (2000) hierarchy of institutions, we examine how home country institutions exerting normative, regulatory, and governance-related controls affect the comparative internationalization levels of listed SOEs and POEs.

When land is required Land Use Changes (LUC) are triggered, causing several environmental and social impacts. Particularly topical is the assessment of indirect LUC effects. Several methodological approaches have been proposed for carrying out the assessment. In this paper we classified LUC models for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) applications into three main categories: Economic, Causal-Descriptive and Normative models. Six models were selected as representative of these three categories and compared according to fifteen criteria covering: modeling framework, impact categories assessed and model transparency. The results show that, progresses have been made in the Economic General Equilibrium Models and the Causal-Descriptive Models compared. Causal-Descriptive models appear more suitable for long-term assessments in the LCA context while the compared economic models are more suitable for short/medium-term assessments of LUC consequences. As LUC dynamics involve interdisciplinary knowledge, a combination of economic, biophysical and statistical data is however required to achieve a robust assessment of complex LUC dynamics. There is still considerable scope for improving current LUC models. In particular, there is room for improving precision of data, identification of marginal land and inclusion of a broader range of impact categories. Current models mainly focus on GHG emission-related impacts and rarely on other environmental impacts such as nutrient leaching, biodiversity impacts and water resource depletion. Socio-economic analyses of LUC patterns are currently excluded from LCA analysis, preventing a holistic assessment of land occupation impacts. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The life cycle assessment methodology was used to analyse the GHG emissions of eight confinement dairy farms that covered different milk production levels, herd structures and diet compositions. The GHG emission per kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) ranged from 1.31 to 2.08 kg CO2 eq. after farm GHG emissions had been allocated to milk, meat and manure. Enteric methane and emissions related to feed production and manure management were the three major GHG emission sources from the eight farms and contributed 54%-60%, 21%-30% and 8%-10%, respectively, to total emissions. Land use per kg of FPCM was 1.81 m2 with the largest contribution from feed production. GHG emissions associated with the production of per kg of FPCM decreased with increasing herd milk productivity and herd feed efficiency. Sensitivity analyses showed that the GHG emissions were significantly affected by metric values of global warming potential (GWP), with increases of about 4% and 12% for the calculation based on the IPCC (2013) GWP values, compared to IPCC (2007) and IPCC (1996) values, respectively; and soybean meal from imported soybeans would increase GHG emissions per kg of FPCM significantly due to the emissions related to land use change. Lowering N-fertilizer use per ha for feed crop production, improving milk productivity and herd structure, and encouraging farmers to use manure for crop production are promising abatement strategies. Due to the low percentage of grass (average 14%) in the diet for dairy cows in the Guanzhong plain, replacing part of the concentrates with alfalfa hay would increase milk productivity and decrease GHG emissions per kg of FPCM. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Critical incident technique (CIT) is examined from a novel perspective to capture uncovered contextual conditions of PMI and show its relevance to studying soft factors of CBA. The paper explains how CIT can be used to gain greater understanding and to reveal the “hidden” aspects of M&A systematically.

It is argued that an imprecise estimation of the costs related to implementing a firm activity in a foreign location has a negative impact on the process performance of that activity. Performance is deterred as operations are likely to be disrupted by managerial distraction and resource misallocation. It is also argued that this relationship is mitigated by the extent to which firms use modularity to coordinate the activity but worsened by the extent to which ongoing communication is used. The results, based on a hierarchical regression analysis of a unique survey on Danish and Swedish firms, support these arguments. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Cost estimation errors; Modularity; Offshoring; Ongoing communication; Process performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931054371

In particular, two components of virtual work; workplace mobility and distributed work, depicting physical and psychological distance to the workplace, have gained substantial scholarly attention. However, while the main stream of the international business literature, studying global virtual teams, has used mobility and distribution as predictors for negative work outcomes, there are indications that virtual work can have positive implications for the organization. In this study, we explore how workplace mobility and distributed work can affect employees' perceptions of their colleagues and of managerial activities. More specifically, we focus on inclusive language use by managers and employees since this is a theme of growing interest in international business research. Relying on responses from 676 individuals from five Danish multicultural business organizations, we demonstrate a positive association between workplace mobility and perceptions of employees' openness to language diversity as well as between distributed work and perceptions of consistent common corporate language at management level. This is consistent with construal level theory predicting that distance between employees and the organization will lead to more objective and goal-oriented perceptions whereas individuals that are more emerged in organizational social life will view issues more in relation to goal irrelevant factors. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Common corporate language; Construal level theory; Distributed work; Inclusion; Language management; Language use; Multicultural organizations; Perceptions; Virtual work; Workplace mobility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930344654

Inertia in the sector in general prolongs the implementation of energy efficient technologies. Demonstration projects have the purpose to test a given technology and its ability to enter the market to support the diffusion of technologies. The aim of the article is to analyze the drivers and barriers in demonstration projects in the maritime sector and the potential outcome of the projects. We analyze the dynamics of the processes in the demonstration projects in order to understand how the projects can facilitate the implementation of energy efficient technologies. The analysis consists of a case study of 5 Danish maritime demonstration projects. The demonstration projects involve both actors that are used to collaborating and actors in new constellations. When the actors do not know each other in advance, their collaboration involves challenges, but they also have the potential for contributing with new knowledge in the network. Demonstration projects are an opportunity to facilitate green retrofits in a somewhat resistant maritime sector, as they serve as a platform for both the development and the implementation of cleaner technologies. Demonstration projects make it possible to test and develop technologies from other sectors. The test of energy efficient technologies contributes to changing the mindsets of the users of the technologies and thereby changing the practices on board the vessels. The potentials for developing and testing technologies in multi-party networks and the economic funding that reduces the economic risks of the involved actors are the main drivers in the demonstration projects. The main barriers, on the other hand, are the existing energy management practices in the sector and the uneven economic risks of the actors involved in the projects. Our results contribute to the understanding of how demonstration projects in the maritime sector are in an early stage of the innovation process where prototypes are not yet developed. The demonstration projects create an opportunity for non-maritime actors to enter the somewhat closed cyclic collaborations in the maritime sector. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, some organizations have begun to integrate these dimensions in recent years. Researchers and practitioners are also working to accelerate the transition for more equitable, sustainable, post-fossil carbon societies by working with all relevant stakeholders. This Special Volume of Journal of Cleaner Production is focused upon on diverse types of supply chain relationships, governance mechanisms, and innovations, which can foster effective and efficient sustainable supply chain management. This volume is comprised of twenty-seven articles and a book review. Fifteen of the articles address the supply chain relationships domain, while five focus primarily upon governance, five upon innovation, and two on relationships and governance.

The article argues that clarifying the difference between green and sustainable public sector food procurement, with political continuity that supports and enables policymakers and practitioners to take an incremental approach to change, makes an important contribution to delivering more sustainable food systems and better public health nutrition. Five European case studies demonstrate the reality of devising and implementing innovative approaches to sustainable public sector food procurement and the effects of cultural and political framings. How legislation is enacted at the national level and interpreted at the local level is a key driver for sustainable procurement. Transition is dependent on political will and leadership and an infrastructure that can balance the economic, environmental and social drivers to effect change. The development of systems and indicators to measure change, reforms to EU directives on procurement, and the relationship between green growth strategies and sustainable diets are also discussed. The findings show the need to explore how consistent definitions for green public procurement and sustainable public procurement can be refined and standardized in order to support governments at all levels in reviewing and analyzing their current food procurement strategies and practices to improve sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A sample of 2437 nationally representative individuals from five European countries was analyzed using a generalized logit model. Our contribution suggests that European consumers are aware of the environmental impact of pig production. Swine production attributes that emerged, as most significant, in our survey are those related to the possibilities of pigs being raised outdoors. Less important, bust still significant, are the positive consumers preference for low fat content, standard meat quality and small farm size. Finally, our results suggest that consumers preferences are massively linked to individual values. In particular, consumers showing enhanced ""self-transcendency"" and high ""openness to change"" values are likely to call for cleaner pork production systems. On the contrary, consumers with more pronounced ""self-enhancement"", ""conservation"" and ""hedonism"" values are more likely to pay little attention to sustainability in the swine sector. Results allow to assess the social acceptance of the implementation of cleaner production processes in livestock production. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result to complex products and processes in ETO companies, PCS are usually gradually implemented where only subsets of the products are included to support specific processes. However, a systematic way to identify and evaluate the products and the processes to be supported with the PCSs is not described in the current literature.

It is not just a way of reducing supply chain lead time as striking examples are emerging of firms employing more radical business opportunities and innovative design techniques available. We review the existing literature on the technology application, examine the classic nozzle case study to identify previously undocumented opportunities from the technology, and add a new case of a firm with a more holistic and strategic focus.

Design/methodology/approach – It is a longitudinal ethnographic case study. Following an inductive theory building approach, data were collected over an 11-year period via in-depth interviews, participant observations and unobtrusive data. Findings – Data reveal three different contexts in which legitimation takes place: legitimation of the new industry and of the new venture domestically and internationally. A new venture drives the process of industry legitimation by achieving legitimacy threshold first nationally at meso and micro levels as well as internationally. The challenge therefore for such a venture is to establish legitimacy in the absence of any precedents at the organization, industry or international levels. Unless at least one new venture achieves legitimacy threshold in a new industry there is no possibility for that industry to become institutionalized. Research limitations/implications – The authors advocate for further research at the intersection between legitimation, international entrepreneurship and emerging markets in order to further advance the emergent theory. Practical implications – The data suggest that in order for an INV to achieve cognitive legitimacy and socio-political legitimacy in an emerging industry located in an emerging economy, and successfully internationalize, it shall design a robust business model targeting both internal and external stakeholders; engage in persuasive argumentation invoking familiar cues and scripts; engage in political negotiations promoting and defending incentive and operating mechanisms; and overcome the country-of-origin effect by pursuing technology legitimation strategy. Social implications – Governments and NGOs may wish to see new industries emerge but they lack the means and mandate to establish and lead them themselves, instead rely on enabling actions, such as investment in capacity building. However, building capacity for an as-yet non-existent industry in an emerging economy may prove to be counter-productive, driving a brain drain of qualified workers who are forced to migrate to find suitable work. The work leads the authors to speculate about whether there may be a role for investment in programs of industry legitimacy building in pursuit of public policy objectives. Originality/value – The study puts forward a process model of new industry legitimation. The model theorizes the process of change from an initial condition in which an industry does not exist to a final condition in which it is institutionalized. The model addresses the case where the initial catalyst is the formation of an INV that is the seed for the birth of the industry. Since both the new venture and the new industry lack cognitive and socio-political legitimacies, the model theorizes temporal emergence of these at organizational and industry levels, leading ultimately to institutionalization. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Early internationalization; Emerging markets; Ethnography; Industry studies; Legitimacy; Theory building",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953426354

Using farms to host tourists has become more widely seen as an effective means of supporting local economies and contributing to the preservation of landscapes and cultural heritage in the countryside. Furthermore, farm-based tourism is considered one of the most environmentally sustainable activities among touristic options. Nevertheless, the environmental sustainability of holiday farms still must be assessed. No applications of an environmental assessment method to touristic farms can be found in the literature. The only reference for such application is the PCR (Product Category Rule) basic module on ""Accommodation, food and beverage services"" developed for the Environmental Product Declaration system®. This document can be used as a reference for declarations for several hosting structures or catering services, nevertheless the performance of this module on touristic farms has not been validated yet. This study therefore aims to discuss and give practical recommendations when the PCR on accommodations is used for holiday farms thorough an actual case study in Northern Italy. The farm adopted as case study covers 15 ha of orchards managed according to the organic production protocol. In order to precisely evaluate the farm, the performance of three functional units was tested applying a full Life Cycle Assessment, in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of the ISO 14040. Among other impact categories, the global warming potential of the whole farm in 2011 is 112 tCO2 eq, which corresponds to 232 kg CO2 eq/(guest ∗ night) and 3.32 kg CO2 eq/€. Considering the services in the farm, 81% of the global warming potential is related to the breakfast service, 2% to the room services and the remaining 18% to the agricultural parts of the system. The results allow us to highlight general key aspects to be considered for the definition of product category rules for such activity including the importance of the choice of the modelling approach, the system boundaries and the functional unit. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Environmental product declaration; Life cycle assessment; Product category rules; Rural development; Sustainable agriculture","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Historic preservation; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Environmental product declarations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Product categories; Rural development; Sustainable agriculture; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949845528

After more than 25 years of attention it is timely to consider the state of research and practice in sustainable tourism. This special volume was established with exactly that goal in mind and this introduction seeks to set the context for this critical examination and reflection on sustainable tourism. Another objective of this introduction was to briefly describe the range of contributions selected for this SV. The articles are organised into four thematic areas of research: community stakeholders' perspectives and business approaches to sustainability in tourism, cultural responses, and methodological challenges related to sustainability. The articles shine a light on issues of importance within sustainable tourism, and in so doing, it is hoped that researchers from other disciplines and backgrounds are encouraged to consider investigating the inter-relationships between societal sustainability and tourism more broadly. The authors of this SV also sought to do something different from the majority of previous papers, which is to bring these issues to readers primarily concerned with sustainability rather than only with tourism. Before briefly discussing the contributions that make up the SV, this introduction provides a discussion of the inter-relationships between tourism and sustainability, a consideration of the ongoing challenges inherent in tackling sustainability and tourism, and a brief overview of the potential for tourism to contribute to the transformative changes required to move to truly sustainable societies. The introduction is concluded with an optimistic look into the future of sustainability-driven work in tourism. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Business perspectives; Community stakeholders; Cultural responses; Investigatory methods; Sustainable tourism","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Business perspective; Community stakeholders; Cultural responses; Investigatory methods; Sustainable tourism; Sustainable development",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947560435

The objective of this work is to extend the research in the area of systematic design of water/wastewater management by further developing and extending a generic model-based synthesis and design framework for retrofit wastewater treatment networks (WWTN) of an existing industrial process. The developed approach is suitable for grassroots and retrofit systems and adaptable to a wide range of wastewater treatment problems. A sequential solution procedure is employed to solve a network superstructure-based optimization problem formulated as Mixed Integer Linear and/or Non-Linear Programming (MILP/MINLP). Data from a petroleum refinery effluent treatment plant together with special design constraints are employed to formulate different design schemes based on recycling and rerouting strategies focusing on completely splitting system and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) opportunity. The base case design of the existing process has been verified against the refinery data, while the grassroots and the retrofit options are generated and compared with the existing process. The network design solutions obtained with effectively computational time from the case study shows an improvement in the reduction of a total annualized cost (TAC) and wastewater discharge rate (WWDR) as a result of water recycling and rerouting options. Pareto plot (trade-off solution graph) for the analysis of such optimal solutions has been applied to implicitly verify the optimality of the solution based on all possible scenarios. Superior retrofit alternatives have been identified based on their performance including cost and environmental impacts and can be used as efficient design guidelines for the future development of the existing wastewater treatment process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The methodology focuses on the homogeneous binary aqueous azeotropic systems (for example, water + alcohols). Additionally, a Hildebrand solubility parameter group contribution model for ILs, and ILs miscibility database have been developed to screen the miscibility of the ILs with the target solute component and these parameters are considered as the main criteria for the screening of ILs. ILs were further screened based on a combination of criteria such as stability, toxicity, and their environmental impacts. All best ILs were used as entrainers, and an extractive distillation column (EDC) and ionic liquid recovery column were designed and simulated with a process simulator to determine the overall energy consumption of the ILs-based separation processes. Among all candidates, the best IL was selected based on the minimum energy requirement obtained from the simulation. Finally, the modification of the separation process to obtain design flexibility for other azeotropic series with respect to the change in size of the target solute was investigated using the same separation process and IL entrainer to obtain the same product purity. The proposed methodology has been evaluated through a case study of binary alcoholic aqueous azeotropic separation: water + ethanol and water + isopropanol. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is focused on how citizenship, local participation and democracy are operationalized and what are the local consequences of this governmental program in the community of Álamos. By following the constitution and decision-making processes in the local Pueblos Mágicos committee, we demonstrate how different groups bargain on behalf of the 'community' and how they seize the opportunity to promote different development priorities. In particular, we address the role of a North American migrant community in shaping sustainable tourism development as cultural brokers, social entrepreneurs and mediators of market knowledge.

Using examples from the exhibition 'Possible Greenland' at the Venice Architectural Biennale of 2012, this paper shows how a Greenland of the future is portrayed and branded as a sustainable nation and destination through future scenarios. The performative approach to the exhibition and its scenarios displays how issues related to all three sides of sustainability - people, planet and profit - are enrolled in an attempt to brand Greenland, but also to motivate and carry out decisions. Two scenarios from the exhibition are used to show how diverging strategies are deployed in order to envision Greenland as sustainable. Where one seeks to embrace disagreement and complexity in its inclusive approach, the other strives to cut across locally grounded controversies. The two strategies are discussed and their potential as 'sustainability brokers' are critically evaluated. The strategic application of the sustainability concept to the exhibition displays the multiple ways by which the concept of sustainability is deployed to exhibit and enact a sustainable future Greenland and shows the difficulty of uniting the various visions propagated through the exhibition. However, it also points to the performative and interventionist potential of scenario building for a sustainable future, which is ultimately discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Future scenarios; Nation branding; Performativity Greenland; Sustainability","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Future scenarios; Greenland; Nation branding; Scenario building; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922021887

Design/methodology/approach – Nespresso was analyzed based on public available secondary data, in combination with related academic concepts on innovation and competitive advantage. Findings – The company succeeded by the thorough application of a strategy that, through perfect alignment, allowed the company to reach a unique market position. However, as described in the case, it took a relatively long time and the company came close to failure several times. Before the current situation of the company, it remains challenging in the future as well. Hence, the Nespresso story provides interesting space for discussion and learning about what innovation is, how innovation emerges, and under which circumstances innovation can serve as a source for competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications – Especially given the current market situation, the case offers different starting points for discussion about innovation and long-term company success. Practical implications – Especially before the current market situation, the case offers different starting points for discussion about innovation and the success of a company on the long term. The case is designed to give practitioners a better understanding on what an innovation as, and how competitive advantages can be linked to innovation. Originality/value – This case of Nespresso is a unique combination of the concepts of innovation and competitive advantage. It serves as an example of an innovation, which was not successful from the scratch, but evolved over time and is still developing. As many innovations went through such a non-linear process, this case offers interesting lessons learned for academics as well as for practitioners. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business strategy; Competitive advantage; Diffusion; Innovation; Intellectual property; New technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950327097

However, inter-organizational innovation does not often lead to the desired results. To understand this paradoxical situation, the purpose of this paper is to examine a high-novelty R&D collaboration between multiple organizations with focus on the occurrence of knowledge boundaries and their underlying mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is based on a grounded longitudinal study of an inter-organizational R&D team. Participant observation data, interviews, and document data have been collected over three years. Findings – The study identified six different knowledge boundaries characterized by processes of sensemaking, strategizing, and group identification. These three processes were all rooted in continuous attempts at the individual level to reduce uncertainty, and the findings therefore highlight the unexpected consequences of uncertainty reduction. Uncertainty reduction through sensemaking, strategizing, and group identification may reduce the uncertainty at the individual level but also provoke the emergence of knowledge boundaries at the team level, thereby impeding knowledge exchange. Furthermore, the knowledge integration literature highlights that knowledge boundaries are relational, but the identification of a cognitive boundary indicates that some problems are so complex that a knowledge boundary is delimited to the single individual. Originality/value – Most research on knowledge boundaries has focussed on the elimination of knowledge boundaries through boundary objects and boundary spanners, but only little attention has been given to the underlying mechanisms of boundary emergence and dynamics. In this paper, it is argued that to efficiently manage knowledge boundaries, an understanding of their underlying mechanisms is needed. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Knowledge creation; Knowledge processes; Knowledge sharing; R&D; Technological innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950308801

When observed in the material collected empirically, methods have been developed in order to identify and remove them from the analytical work. The purpose of this paper is to re-visit and re-introduce a dissensus-based management research strategy in order to analytically be able to work with what appear to be contradictions and misinformation in qualitative research accounts, and give them a more profound role in the understanding of management ideas, work and practices. Design/methodology/approach – A literature review is presented on consensus and dissensus orientated theories on contradictions and multiple and conflicting identities in a single individual in an ethnographic inquiry. The purpose is to analyse and reflect upon the contradictory information gathered, and how it can shed light upon important aspects of the management work and practices performed by the informant. This is done by focusing on apparent contradictions in a single interview situation from an ethnographic case study through, respectively a consensus and a dissensus perspective. Findings – The findings indicate that dealing with contradictions and inner conflicts between self-view and external demands and conditions, led the informant to the production of multiple narrative self-identities imaging multiple realities that all appeared real to the informant. Each of these realities had different and contradictory impacts on the ideas and management work and practices he presented and performed in the organisation. These findings challenge the notions of “lies”, “deception” and “misinformation” in management research, and call for a more reflexive approach to analysis work in ethnographic accounts. Originality/value – By applying consensus and dissensus-oriented theories to a single account the authors point to conditions, phenomena and relations, which most current and historic management research streams fail to see. Multiple and conflicting identities surface in a single respondent during an interview situation, creating clearly self-contradictory and conflicting narratives and practices, that all appear to be oblivious to the respondent. These multiple and contradictory narrative identities all have significant impact on the management work performed by the respondent. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Contradictions; Dissensus-oriented theories; Impression management; Management research; Multiple identities; Qualitative research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951826923

The purpose of this paper is to unravel the direct as well as indirect influences on the learning curve and to advance the understanding of how these affect its management. Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds on the offshoring, capacity expansion and learning curve literature. The existing scholarship often lacks detailed insights into the factors surrounding the globalisation of production, and how constructing and operationalising new capacities overseas should be implemented. The paper employs qualitative methodology and draws on a longitudinal, factory-level analysis of an in-depth case study of a Danish wind turbine manufacturer. Findings – This study goes beyond a simplistic treatment of the lead time and learning required to establish a new capacity. The authors examined the dimensions of the learning process involved in a capacity expansion project and identified the direct and indirect labour influences on the production learning curve. On this basis, the study proposes solutions to managing learning curves in overseas capacity expansions. Furthermore, the paper concludes with measures that have the potential to significantly reduce the non-value-added time when establishing new capacities overseas.

We differentiate persona-fied brands from other human brands, we dimensionalise the chef persona, and we identify two possible models of brand management through persona: (1) the distributed or fragmented persona-fication of the brand, which is based on a disjunction of different facets of the brand persona, each embodied in different persons; and (2) the unified persona-fication of the brand, which is based on the conjunction of the different facets of the brand persona. Here, the persona is embodied in a single person who embodies the different facets of the brand persona.

However, less attention has been devoted to brand measurement—specifically efforts to construct a measure that attempts to explain the relationship between voters and parties. Against this backdrop, this article discusses how to measure a political brand by first selecting one part of the diverse brand concept for further investigation. Next, the two existing brand measures in the literature are evaluated, and the article proposes an alternative measure that underlines a stronger connection to the immense political science literature on voters and parties. Then, the three measures are compared by empirically investigating which measure is best at explaining voters' party sympathy. Here, it is demonstrated that the alternative measure seems to be the most valid and reliable construct when it comes to explaining voters' sympathy for a particular party. Finally, the proposed alternative measure is further validated in a representative sample (N = 2251), establishing a preliminary correlation between party brand and voter sympathy. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","measurement; political brands; political marketing; political psychology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952714504

We further propose that their increased applicability depends on three specific conditions: the degree of administrative autonomy, performance-based budgeting and market-like competition.

The recognition that operational safety (and patient safety in health care) depends on our abilities to control human error does not mean that efforts should be directed exclusively to the psychological mechanisms underlying human error. Rather, effective safety management should be directed at factors that are conducive to human failure (Rasmussen, 1986)-in particular factors that are within the direct control of the organization. Thus, organizational factors have long been acknowledged to be of critical importance for safety in human-machine system operations (Griffiths, 1985; Reason, 1993), and in Reason’s thesis it has been pointed out that organizational problems are frequently latent causal factors that contribute or even lead to the occurrence of human error made by frontline personnel and has become part of the industry standard in this field (Reason, 1997). Indeed, the majority of contributing causes to major accidents may be attributed to the organizations themselves (ibid.). For example, it has been reported that 40% of incidents in the Dutch steel industry were caused by organizational failures (van Vuuren, 2000). Similarly, based on studies in aviation and maritime operations, it has been suggested that the quality and safety, by which the operators accomplish their tasks, are affected not only by their professional and technical competence and skills, but also by their attitudes to and perceptions of their job roles, their organization, and management (Helmreich and Merritt, 1998). © 2012 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136388194

A key finding emerging is that the amount of recent attendance at events influences networking behaviour (and possibly vice versa) irrespective of network event experience.

The findings showed reliability and validity of the proposed measurement scales. The study supported the hypothesized positive influence of all three dimensions on ad liking, but to variable degree. The results showed that the suggested application of the framework is capable of measuring advertizing experiences based on their degree of didactic, narrative and lyrical potential.

Some DM experts deplore such local mutations of DM. They offer expert, generic advice to help implement it correctly, expecting that proper implementation will enable organizations to reap the inherent benefits of this best practice.

One reason is the realization that existing approaches centered on usability and utility do not seem to cover aspects of use essential to the realm of the everyday. Another reason aesthetics enters the picture is that by leaving the established domain of personal computing, pervasive information technology comes in close contact with other design traditions engaged in the design of everyday things, and thus also a very different set of perspectives, values, and approaches. As we position pervasive information systems in relation to design traditions such as architecture and industrial design, it becomes apparent that we often lack even a rudimentary understanding of the expressiveness and aesthetics of the technology with which we are working. This chapter presents the critical issues that need to be addressed during the design of aesthetically compliant pervasive information systems. Initially, the chapter discusses the rationale leading to the emergence of aesthetics as a core research topic for the design of pervasive systems. By adopting a holistic investigation viewpoint, the chapter discusses the most important developments in this field by focusing on the prospects of incorporating aesthetics on interaction design, extending the traditional information systems’ design objectives, which were orchestrated around the system’s utility and productivity. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

The homogeneity of the archive of the past built on a system of cultural capital-infused decisions that led to differentiation from inscription to interpretation to enacted power can be upset by the technical ability of machines.

In Denmark, the original form of retailing was the merchant’s house, where trade in all kinds of goods took place and where customers were served from a relatively large area. It also included crafts-related retailing, where selling was strongly linked to production because the craftsmen marketed the goods they themselves produced, but from around the late nineteenth century these craftsmen increasingly became small shopkeepers. The period from 1920 to 1960 was characterized by profound changes in the Danish marketing system.

The ﬁrst author of this chapter, just like Boyle (2004), remembers avid discussions among peers around the age of ten of the futuristic possibilities of producing and consuming pork roast or meat balls from tubes ‘just like the Apollo astronauts’. While pork roast in a tube is still not to be found on the supermarket shelves, it is deﬁnitely a matter of fact that food engineering has conquered new territory and created types of food that only few grandmothers would recognise as such, to paraphrase Michael Pollan (2008). However, industrialised foods are increasingly under pressure from a variety of movements, promoting ‘slow food’, local produce offered in public markets, customer-supported agriculture and similar initiatives (see e.g. Visconti, Minowa, & Maclaran, 2014; Press & Arnould, 2011; Petrini, 2001). These (and numerous other similar) works investigate the morality and ethics behind an emerging – oftentimes simultaneously utopian, nostalgic and very real – variety of alternative systems of production and consumption (see Julier, Chapter 6), that promote better food quality and a more direct and traceable link between the consumer and the spheres of food production. Much of the contemporary policing of food is discursively constructed around the notion of authenticity. This chapter investigates consumer navigation between what they qualify as ‘authentic’ or ‘real’ and, conversely, ‘unreal’ food. The purpose of the chapter is to propose a semiotics of food authenticity and reﬂect on the impact on meal practices. We build our arguments based on the results of a Danish health branding project, notably drawing on results reported in prior publications (Chrysochou & Grunert, 2014; Ulver, Askegaard, & Kristensen; 2011; Chrysochou, Askegaard, Grunert, & Kristensen, 2010). These studies all contained dimensions that directly or indirectly inform consumer reﬂections on food authenticity. The following chapter builds on these insights but we will also be adding data collected in the context of the health branding project but not previously used. © 2016 Benedetta Cappellini, David Marshall and Elizabeth Parsons.

As Holden notes, the supermarket visit with a child means dealing with marketing stimuli in a public place while at the same time having to buy necessities for one’s everyday life (Holden, 1983). Pettersson, Olsson, and Fjellstrom (2004) found that some parents avoid shopping for food with their children as they experience this as stressful and exhausting. However, when actually looking at studies on parent/child supermarket shopping, very few signs of coercive and pestering behaviour are found, and other types of relational interaction seem to be much more important in family supermarket practice (Gram, 2014; Marshall, 2014; Commuri & Gentry, 2000). This chapter shows that shopping with children can also be a pleasant experience and is an opportunity for both doing and displaying family (Finch, 2007; DeVault, 1991) in an everyday life that is relatively segregated between work, school, spare time activities and electronic devices. As noted by Phoenix (2005: 88) declining birthrates have meant that children have taken the central role in parents’ lives and ‘are seen to reﬂect on their parents’ identities and afﬂuence’, and family food consumption is not just about product choice but also about social interaction and identity (Jackson, 2009). This chapter is about families shopping for food together. Going to the supermarket has become, if not an everyday routine, then at least a very frequent part of our food practices in the Western world. The arenas of food (Halkier, 2010), childhood and motherhood (Eyer, 1996; Zelizer, 1985) are loaded with values, norms and ideology, which parents and children need to navigate (see Marshall, Chapter 13). In the following account family supermarket visits are seen as collective processes with high levels of routinised behaviour intertwined with ideals and social norms about which food ought to be eaten, how parent/child interaction should take place, parents’ and children’s positions when interacting in the supermarkets, while at the same time being tempted by the food products on offer, and parents and children possibly having different ideas about what the family should eat. Practices of buying food involve at the same time pleasant intergenerational togethernessand anxiety and tension. The study is based on 50 observations of adults and children shopping for food together in the northern part of Denmark. © 2016 Benedetta Cappellini, David Marshall and Elizabeth Parsons.

In this respect, hybrid organizations that are formed as businesses with a mission to be sustainable and to provide services for society - such as water companies - are a good point of departure. Water companies are highly regulated whilst working primarily for the betterment of society and on behalf of generations to come, for whom clean and plentiful water and the preservation of nature is a must. Linne Marie has dug deep into these types of hybrid organizations in order to reveal which mechanisms of organizational governance for sustainability are at play, and how these organizations manage to balance their triple bottom lines in order to survive financially, socially, and environmentally and make a business out of their conduct. Balancing these three bottom lines in a sustainable way is explained in a clear and accessible way and the juxtaposition between non-profit and for-profit water companies will show how this model can be transferred to other business spheres. © Linne Marie Lauesen 2015.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070608951

In the context of an evolving business world, it examines the complete software process lifecycle, from the initial definition of a product to its systematic improvement. In doing so, it addresses difficult problems, such as how to implement processes in highly regulated domains or where to find a suitable notation system for documenting processes, and provides essential insights and tips to help readers manage process evolutions. And last not least, it provides a wealth of examples and cases on how to deal with software evolution in practice. Reflecting these topics, the book is divided into three parts. Part 1 focuses on software business transformation and addresses the questions of which process(es) to use and adapt, and how to organize process improvement programs. Subsequently, Part 2 mainly addresses process modeling. Lastly, Part 3 collects concrete approaches, experiences, and recommendations that can help to improve software processes, with a particular focus on specific lifecycle phases. This book is aimed at anyone interested in understanding and optimizing software development tasks at their organization. While the experiences and ideas presented will be useful for both those readers who are unfamiliar with software process improvement and want to get an overview of the different aspects of the topic, and for those who are experts with many years of experience, it particularly targets the needs of researchers and Ph.D. students in the area of software and systems engineering or information systems who study advanced topics concerning the organization and management of (software development) projects and process improvements projects. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Agile process Management; Method Engineering; Software development process management; Software development techniques; Software notations and tools; Value-driven software development",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068841188

How should designers get to know the users’ interests and needs? Who should speak for the users? How may designers collaborate with users and in what ways may users take innovation into their own hands? The New Production of Users offers a rare overview of these issues. It traces the history of designer-user relations from the era of mass production to the present days. Its focus lies in elaborating the currently emerging strategies and approaches to user involvement in business and citizen contexts. It analyses the challenges in the practical collaborations between designers and users, and it investigates a number of cases, where groups of users collectively took charge of innovation. In addition to a number of new case studies, the book provides a thorough account of theories of user involvement as well as and offers further developments to these theories. As a part of this, the book relates to the wide spectrum of fields currently associated with user involvement, such as user-centered design, participatory design, user innovation, open source software, cocreation and peer production. Exploring the nexus between users and designers, between efforts to democratize innovation and to mobilize users for commercial purposes, this multi-disciplinary book will be of great interest to academics, policy makers and practitioners in fields such as Innovation Studies, Innovation Policy, Science and Technology Studies, Cultural Studies, Consumption studies, Marketing, e-commerce, Media Studies as well as Design research. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064821548

The purchase of a US$ 500 permit now enables especially wealthy tourists from the North to visit the gorillas in their natural habitat. Through complex processes of habituation, in which they are getting used to the presence of human beings, gorillas are turned into ‘objects of the tourist gaze’ and acquire economic value. However, even before this new relationship to tourism and tourists, gorillas have also enacted other networks. For centuries, gorillas of Bwindi have co-existed with and competed for forest resources with hunter-food gathering and farming communities. From the late nineteenth century onwards, they were captured, studied and designated as “man’s closest neighbor” in a scientific network of biologists.

Against this background, this paper analyzes reward-based crowdfunding campaign strategies and their communication tools. To do this, 446 crowdfunding projects were gathered and empirically analyzed. Three different paths of successful crowdfunding projects could be identified and are described in detail. Practical implications of crowdfunding strategies are derived, and are dependent on the required sales effort and the project added value. The terms communicator, networker and self-runner are created for this crowdfunding strategy and filled with practical examples. This paper contributes to the literature in different ways: first, it sheds more light on the developing concept of crowdfunding, with an overview of current academic discussions on crowdfunding. Furthermore, the analysis of success factors for crowdfunding initiatives adds to an emerging area of research and allows entrepreneurs to extract best practice examples for increasing the probability of successful crowdfunding projects under consideration of the key influencing factors of communication. © 2016 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge","Communication; Crowdfunding; fsQCA; Germany; Reward-based; Success factors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052234569

Knowledge flows, subsidiary power and rent-seeking within MNCs, by Ram Mudambi and Pietro Navarra, published in the Journal of International Business Studies in 2004 Empirical focus Mudambi and Navarra’s (2004) starting point is the dilemma that is connected to the increasing strategic independence of subsidiaries in multinational corporations (MNCs). On the one hand, subsidiary independence constitutes a vital prerequisite of learning and competitive advantage of MNCs. On the other hand, strategic independence and strong bargaining power enhances the subsidiaries’ ability to seek and appropriate rents that challenge the shareholder value of the MNC as a whole. Thus subsidiary strategic independence, designed to enhance the competitiveness of outputs (market knowledge) and inputs (asset-seeking and learning), can be corroded when the pursuit of subsidiary objectives encourages rent-seeking. (Mudambi and Navarra 2004: 385) The paper aims at understanding the determinants of the political behaviour of rent-seeking by subsidiaries in MNCs. The paper addresses the question to what extent subsidiary rent-seeking is related to subsidiary bargaining power, and to what extent subsidiary bargaining power, in turn, is constituted by knowledge flows. In the model presented by Mudambi and Navarra (2004) subsidiary power assumes a central role as subsidiary power is used as both explanandum (explained by knowledge flows) and explanans (explaining rent-seeking). The empirical analysis conducted largely confirms that knowledge flows within MNCs are strong predictors for subsidiary power and that subsidiary power is a strong predictor for the subsidiary managers’ ability to appropriate rents. In particular, subsidiaries vested with knowledge that is vital for the MNC as a whole and subsidiaries with large knowledge outflows to other MNC units tend to command a high bargaining power within the MNC and therefore a higher ability to appropriate rents. Theoretical focus The paper adopts a rational-system perspective of the MNC, which is blended with a natural-system perspective. While the natural-system perspective finds expression in seeing MNCs as political systems full of interest diversity, bargaining and conflict, the rational-system perspective appears to take precedence over the former. The rational-system perspective is reflected in the remnants of a hierarchical view of the MNC, where headquarters are vested with the role, power and ability to maintain overall organizational rationality. A case in point is the paper’s suggestions on how rent-seeking behaviour of subsidiary managers may be curbed by headquarters. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047560035

It describes performative operations political actors undertake in their struggle for power. Hence, politicking is about the means and tactics of interest representation. Following an overview by Palonen ‘politicking has received a minimal amount of attention in literature on the concept of politics, although it refers to a key aspect in the understanding of politics-as-activity’ (2003: 177). An exception, however, is the literature on organizational politics. Here a number of authors - mostly from organizational behaviour and organizational psychology backgrounds - have studied politicking as influence tactics organizational actors apply in their struggle for power and interest representation. In the remainder of this short section we will first take a look at the literature on influence tactics that has emerged through studying how supervisors, subordinates and peer/team members within collocated organizations interact politically. We will then shift attention to the few papers that up until now have addressed the issue of politicking in multinational (i.e. dislocated) corporations, mostly under the label of ‘issue selling tactics’. Matching the insights the influence tactics literature has brought about for collocated organizations with the piecemeal literature on issue selling in multinational corporations, we will advance a set of new directions for researching ‘politicking’ in multinational corporations. Influence tactics Research on influence tactics goes back to the 1970s with Allen et al. (1979) breaking ground by specifying a list of ‘organizational politics tactics’. The term ‘influence tactics’ then first appeared in an exploratory study of Kipnis et al. (1980) that aimed to measure categories of influence behaviour and reasons for making influence attempts in organizations. Following Pfeffer (1981: 137) influence tactics can be defined as a means to acquire power through the exercise of power in organizations. Over the next two decades a number of studies (e.g. Ansari 1990; Yukl and Falbe 1990; Ferris et al. 2002) used, refined and extended the list of influence tactics. Summarizing these works, an impressive reservoir of influence tactics, shortly described in Table 10.1 becomes visible. This early research on influence tactics was also looking into the direction in which influence tactics are used, revealing strong differences among tactics, with for instance ‘rational persuasion’ widely used in all directions, ‘pressure’ mostly used downward and ‘coalition building’ mostly used laterally in the organization. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047516830

Based on the latest developments in academic research, the author offers solid advice on how to manage uncertainty in every-day life, bringing a new perspective to these issues and extrapolating this to offer implications for an organisational and managerial context. The author brings this emerging area of research to a wider audience by: •Tying together insights from various fields including psychology, engineering, business and management. •Creating a framework for usefully applying the research concepts in every-day life. •Extrapolating insights from the psychology of individual decision makers to the organisational context and managerial decision-making. •Creating highly applicable and impactful recommendations for how managers, organisations, and every day people can understand and manage uncertainty in their life. The book is divided into two main parts. Part I deals with the behaviour of individuals facing uncertainty and includes accessible explanations and examples of every-day applications, while Part II deals with behaviour in organisations facing uncertainty, where insights from Part I are combined and related to the organisational and work context to explore how, for example, (mis)-perceptions and decision-making biases impact managerial life.

This paper is based on a theory-building approach that combines existing theory and cases. Three cases demonstrate other stakeholders' involvement in the process and the impact of this involvement on the facilitator's role. The research in the three cases applied is based on workshops, interviews and observations. The cases are viewed from role and network perspectives, offering both possibilities and limitations for innovations in different stages of construction projects. Construction process facilitators fill the role of assisting and enabling the process. To achieve project success, they align the activities of various stakeholders. They reach alignment by influencing the other stakeholders, based on competences and the role taken and made.

By examining the field of diversity management as a multilayered phenomenon, we offer empirical insights into how distinct diversity discourses can develop in different national settings, and in which ways macro-level discourses may influence meso-level perceptions of diversity and practices of diversity management.

Accounting and finance professionals are an active ingredient driving financial innovation and adaptation within the financialized banking business model. The global banking business model has also become increasingly complex, but, fundamentally, banks are financial intermediaries that convert liabilities into different types of assets. Accounting and finance professionals are thus not only called upon to develop new financial products but are handsomely rewarded if this contributes to generating higher profits on shareholder funds. The accounting professional bodies and accounting standards-setting agencies such as International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) define their general objectives, which are set out in the accounting conceptual framework.

The notion of organized professionalism has been proposed to define and understand the emergence of a new synthesis between professions and organizations in contemporary societies. The concept of governmentality raises the question of how to think about professional agency in a context that focuses on imposing control through monitoring and transparencies and on the embodiment of control through complex internalization processes.

The outcome of this practice is, however, contested. In the UK, for example, Michael Power has labelled this development ‘the audit society’. He argues that audit is shaping many organizations’ practices and managers’ everyday experiences but represents rituals producing comfort without furthering the improvement of the public sector or society at large. Alongside economic crises and public management reforms, the public sector worldwide has been under pressure to improve its performance and administrative accountability. Following the financial crisis in 2007-2008 there is an increased interest in finding out whether performance audit is ‘delivering’ on its promises. This chapter analyses comparative survey data on civil servants’ perceptions of the audit process and the impact of performance audit on public administration in the Scandinavian countries. We consider four dimensions of impacts: perceived usefulness; holding ministers to account; causing changes; and making improvements in the audited organizations. In addition, the chapter discusses some institutional factors that may influence the impacts. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Irvine Lapsley and Hans Knutsson; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026228102

While the Danish case is often associated with positive values, such as involvement, local democracy and dialogue, the current chapter aims at offering an alternative interpretation of the Danish NPM story as a story of invisible power operations. Based on the analysis of a performance measurement initiative at two hospital departments, the paper demonstrates how the departments are formally given the freedom to choose the indicators they prefer while in reality their freedom is restricted by what Foucault refers to as ‘modern power’. Thus, we argue that the employees are made responsible for interpreting how top management views the world, which translates into the development of a set of performance indicators that looks suspiciously similar to the ones preferred by senior management. In this regard, the chapter contends that the myth of Danish democratic NPM processes blurs the power operations that do take place and that this blurring may imply an even stronger element of power than a top-down approach. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Irvine Lapsley and Hans Knutsson; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026222966

Public sector innovation is related to creating new services that have value for stakeholders (such as citizens) in terms of the social and political outcomes they produce. Innovation in City Governments: Structures, Networks, and Leadership establishes an analytical framework for innovation capacity based on three dimensions: 1 Structure-governance structures and societal traditions, political and socioeconomic context 2 Networks-informal structures that shape and constrain actors and their ability to implement new ideas, connections outside the organization 3 Leadership-the qualities and capabilities of senior individuals within the organization. Each of these is analysed using data from a comparative an EU research project that compared Barcelona, Copenhagen and Rotterdam. The book provides major new insights on how structures, networks, and leadership in city governments shape the innovation capacity of cities. It provides groundbreaking analyses of how governance structures and local socioeconomic challenges are related to the innovations introduced by these cities. The volume maps and analyses the social networks of the three cities and examines brokerage and boundary spanning within and outside of the cities. It also examines what leadership qualities are important for innovation. Innovation in City Governments: Structures, Networks, and Leadership combines an original analytical approach with comparative empirical work, to generate a novel perspective on the social innovation capacity of cities and is critical reading for academics, students and policy makers alike in the fields of Public Management, Public Administration, Local Government, Policy, Innovation and Leadership. © 2017 Taylor & Francis",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024919118

This chapter focuses on the question of whether or not there exists in the European research community something like an evolving diversity theory or if there continues to be a rather eclectic approach of theoretical perspectives as varied as the topic of diversity itself. Recent empirical evidence suggests that the aim of diversity management campaigns of the majority of DAX 30 companies in Germany with Europe-wide and worldwide operations are indeed consistent with neo-institutionalist theory. Neo-institutionalist theory accounts for the rapid dissemination of diversity management in Germany by stressing the normative power of institutions such as the growing number of diversity officer positions, diversity task forces and diversity awareness training. The chapter derives the personnel economics which is proposed as a link between the neo-institutionalist theories and human resource management as an overarching meta-theoretical umbrella for diversity management. © Stefan Gröschl 2011.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021362043

First, learning by using may usefully be construed as a complex, historical process characterized by varying degrees of contingency. Second, the agency of users is distributed and heterogeneous. Users depend on learning-for-using devices for the collection and systematization of knowledge. To assess the importance of the user assemblage of wind turbine owners, it is necessary to include the specific learning-by-using devices that were employed, such as the members' statistic and surveys, and to examine other types of input to changes in users' practices, such as the Wind Atlas method. Predictive knowledge about the expected power production of specific wind turbines at specific sites was important to wind turbine users. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020958796

The book analyzes the economic transformation and addresses the shortcomings of existing interpretations of the “Chinese Miracle” and develops a new multi-dimensional framework. In addition, it shows how the private sector has been developing and what a major role it is playing in pushing forward the overall economic development. The book also focuses on the analysis of China’s fiscal transformation. With the set of refined principles of fiscal federalism that the author has developed, it examines the problems of Chinese fiscal federalism in contrast to them.

At least not in the sense that its stakeholders are mobilized by their desire to dispute new knowledge claims, question political decisions, or voice their concerns about some emerging or untested technology. Unlike climate change, fracking, GMOs, or immunization schemes, the involvement of actors in the New Nordic Food movement is not primarily defined by their distrust or their alarm, their skepticism or their disagreement, but by rather more laudatory impulses like culinary experimentation or social innovation. And yet it would be a mistake to think that these actors are not engaged in some form of political undertaking. The New Nordic Food movement has an explicit agenda of changing not only the state of affairs in, but also the premises on which we perceive and engage with, a range of contemporary issues, many of which are traditionally controversial, such as sustainability, rural development or public health. It is a form of politics that does not take place in the established political arenas, but in the everyday laboratories of growers, consumers, chefs, tourism professionals, food scientists, and nutritionists.

However, there seems also to be more often hidden aspects of labour market participation that might include more dualization in welfare states. This article will focus on occupational welfare in Denmark. The definition of occupational welfare used in this article revolves around especially on collective solutions, e.g., decisions taken among the labour market partners. Whether this is supplementary or substitute for public welfare is thus not the central scope of analysis, neither as at least a starting point whether the development has been supported by fiscal welfare (taxexpenditures). Emphasis will be on the core aspects of what the social partners in Denmark - sometimes as part of tri-partite agreements - has focused on that resembles or can directly be seen as provision of welfare either as services or benefits in-cash delivered only to those being on the labour market. It shows how occupational welfare has developed in two central welfare policy areas - such as pensions and family life. The question for the article is thus whether more occupational welfare challenges the universal approach in the Danish welfare state or just supplements existing welfare. A further question is whether and how this might influence equality in a Nordic welfare state. The article shows that the development towards more occupational welfare in these specific areas are argued to be mainly driven, in relation to pension, a historical need to increase saving, and with regard to family life the change in roles between men and women implying a need for a stronger focus on how to reconcile work and family life. These changes are further driven mainly as a way of supplementing the universal welfare state. However, these changes also imply new types of dualization and degrees of inequality between those more and those less strongly attached to the labor market. © 2016 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

While airlines acquire an aircraft as an input factor for their network operations only once, they will need spare parts over the full operational life cycle of an aircraft for decades-to keep it flying as seamlessly as possible with a minimum of interruptions caused by missing parts. Accordingly, the availability of the right spare part-to immediately replace the defective part at the right place-at the airport or maintenance base where the aircraft is waiting to go back into operation is crucial. Material services companies have the ambition to serve both material suppliers and airline customers with an efficient value adding global network and integrated performance based services, efficiently connecting both ends of the market. In order to reduce the significant transaction costs in this highly complex value chain, innovative airlines, as well as Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) organisations, seek integrated material solutions, where a strategic partner organizes the full material value chain towards suppliers and provides a comprehensive part number range to the airline customers. In a consolidating market, leading material integrators-like Satair Group-will continue to grow and integrate the customer platform, the supplier interface, the value chain processes, and the digitalization-driven data management systems realizing functional and global economies of scale, scope, and density in combination with significant transaction cost reductions. New market segments such as used parts and additive manufacturing/3D printing will contribute to more opportunities along the material value chain. The strategies of the market players in combination with the market and innovation trends will reinforce each other, leading to a high integrative market dynamic for the years to come. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019221897

It is certainly true both that critical scholarship on management does not live the embattled existence here that it does elsewhere and that Scandinavians have been quite vocal in some branches of CMS.

By combining the funnel analogy with considerations in terms of prioritising different requirements, the intention with our empirical study is to contribute to the prevalent understanding of managing the CE activities. The research mainly addresses CE activities at the architecture level. Two cases, each consisting of three embedded cases, present six CE projects. Each CE project involves a company located in a high-wage area and one of two captured manufacturing facilities; one is located in Eastern Europe, while the other is located in the Far East. Two projects are accomplished without significant drawbacks and only minor iterations occur. Significant drawbacks and major iterations occur in three projects; the involved companies are incapable of understanding the consequences of using ""the standard integral product architecture"" prior to starting up the manufacturing. Final, one project is terminated; mainly due to the applied product architecture turns up as being unusable to offer customization options, and partly due to the manufacturing- and supply chain architecture not being considered up front the development. © IEOM Society International.","Architecture; Concurrent engineering; Level of customisation; Managerial approach; One-size-fits-all",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018952639

Since the beginning of the 1990s, an increasing share of M&As has taken the form of cross-border acquisitions (CBAs) (Bertrand and Betschinger 2012). Paralleling with their popularity and practical importance, in both monetary and strategic terms, however, a majority of research findings show that the performance of M&A deals has not significantly improved over these decades (King et al. 2004; Martynova and Renneboog 2008). Other studies (Larimo and Pynnönen 2008; Kallunki et al. 2001), on the other hand, have concluded that, on average, foreign direct investment has significant value creating effects for investing firm shareholders. The researchers continue to be bewildered by the unpredictable nature of M&As, concluding their studies with: “a huge portion of variance remains unexplained” (Stahl and Voight 2004). According to Meglio and Risberg (2010), “one has not learnt very much about how the M&A process unfolds over time, how to measure M&A performance, and what makes an acquisition succeed."" Based on their experience with 70 M&As, Marks and Mirvis (2001) argue that the process through which the deal is conceived and executed is at the core of many failed combinations. Hence, an important question is not simply what to acquire, but also how to acquire. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the consequences of acquisitions, greater attention must be paid to the process that acquirers use to seize value from acquisitions (Hapeslagh and Jemison 1991; Haleblian et al. 2009). © The Editor(s) and the Author(s) 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018907680

The cluster analytic findings indicate distinctive patterns of relationships between aims and firm characteristics. Aims related to employee performance are most important to foreign-owned firms, financial aims are most important to non-public small and medium-sized firms and aims related to corporate image are most important to big firms and to firms that do not provide profit sharing.

This question has been at the centre of academic inquiry ever since the introduction of the Internet. Yet, there has recently been a number of calls for more research to explore how the Internet as a global techno-social system can add value as a driver of internationalization in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) (Plakoyiannaki et al. 2014; Reuber and Fischer 2011; Sinkovics et al. 2013). With this study, we aim to address this call for research. Drawing on the Uppsala internationalization process model (Johanson and Vahlne 1977, 1993; Johanson and Wiedersheim-Paul 1975) we explore how SMEs can leverage the Internet to create value when seeking to expand their business abroad by reducing the amount of risk associated with doing business in foreign markets. The Uppsala internationalization process model is one of the most extensively used theories within academic inquiry on SME internationalization (Coviello and McAuley 1999; Ruzzier et al. 2006) and highlights important factors which impact on the internationalization process (Fillis 2001). © 2017 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and the Author(s).",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018085771

A minor proportion of those are high growth companies with a significant presence on international markets. Local firms operate in a diversity of industrial sectors, which are characterized by medium to high technological intensity. According to the Danish government, Danish firms cannot compete with foreign competitors based on low salaries alone because they will be undercut by international competitors who enjoy a lower cost base. In parallel, since the last financial crisis, Danish firms have struggled with the issue of low productivity, which does not justify the relatively high levels of salary. Because Northern Jutland, being part of Denmark, falls into the category of a knowledge-based society with a good educational infrastructure, Industry 4.0-related opportunities can provide a significant boost to the local economy if tackled in the right way and contribute to market development and international expansion.

In this process, companies exchange inputs and/or outputs with domestic and foreign firms in dyadic transactions while value is sequentially added in a way that is not clearly identified, just as when more sophisticated activities are performed transactional value is added until the final customer is reached (Ritchie and Brindley 2000; Kumaraswamy et al. 2012). Nevertheless, there is little discussion of how value is created or derived throughout these transactions. Instead, in line with neoclassical economics, it is generally assumed that value is created through firms’ participation in value chains and, ultimately, ‘consumed’ by individual customers. The marketing literature has been exploring value creation as a process creating value for the customer to use or co-created with the customer based on his/her preferences. Moreover, research by Vargo and Lusch (2011) and Akaka et al. (2013) has prominently developed a service-ecosystems perspective that places centrality to context in value creation, developing the ideas of service exchange, integration of resources, value co-creation, and value-in-context (Akaka et al. 2013). The concept of value creation has also been embraced and made central in the understanding of the nature of marketing by the American Marketing Association (AMA) so that the product is no longer the object of exchange between a firm and its customer, but it is an offering, a bundle that creates value for the immediate customer, various parties that make the bundle happen, and the society at large. The AMA definition of marketing adopted in 2013 is: ‘Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large’ (AMA 2013). Business model researchers place value at the focus of a firm’s business model (Zott et al. 2011) and as such value transcends inputs, outputs, partners (suppliers and buyers), and determines the company’s costs and revenue, thus making value the backbone of each business organization. Strategic management literature also adopts the concept of value in accordance to Porter’s Value Chain of a firm, which looks at all primary and support activities that through sequence and interplay create the margins for the firm and enable it to function and grow (Rindova et al. 2010). Meanwhile, innovation research claims that firms create value by increased and more effective research and development (R&D) (Sirmon et al. 2007), through explorative and exploitive innovation (Gupta et al. 2006), therefore, emphasizing a specific activity and a company or even a national platform that enables firms to create value. Consequently, academic literature, in spite of its specific perspective, shows an evident consensus in developing the notion that value is central to the purpose of any business and is essential to the business, its business network of suppliers, customers and stakeholders, and to satisfying the customer needs and wants (Payne et al. 2008). © 2017 The Editor(s) (if applicable) and the Author(s).",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018055987

The book provides readers with historical background, theoretical guideposts and an up-to-date account of the contemporary production of users. It reviews the theories of users and user production in innovation. The book explores various user-producer engagements in the tension zone between the hopes of democratized technology and industry strategizing. It examines how innovation is shaped by non-use and unwanted innovation. Innovation studies are perhaps the most systematically built and upgraded of the current approaches to users in innovation. Users in the twenty-first century will play different roles in innovation, production and consumption than they did previously. Users will develop new forms of innovative collectives that enable their engagement with products and technologies, and users will be faced with equally creative managers, designers and producers who will develop new strategies for involving and analyzing users. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017877244

In this chapter, Stephensen discusses how contemporary discourses on ‘creativity at work’ and the ‘creative economy’ are the outcome of normatively driven critiques that previously were raised against capitalism as a force that stifles creativity and hence alienates Man. The creative economy seemingly makes amends. Yet, creativity has also become a crucial factor in the description and prescription of current economic ‘realities.’ Today, the chapter demonstrates, the economy is increasingly ‘talked into being’: that is, performatively created both through discourse-through the ideological framing of the economy within theoretical knowledge production-and materially through the invention of creativity, facilitating technologies of production and communication. © The Editor(s) and The Author(s) 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017656593

This view was central to their moral posture; as financially disinterested agents, colonial officials claimed to administrate deeper economic and moral laws of development.

Based on a simulation model that examines the performance implications of firms' learning strategies when offshoring, we show that such knowledge accumulation can be achieved through either a home-based or a host-based learning strategy. Our analysis suggests that the relative performance of these two strategies depends on nontrivial interactions among the costs of communication, the distance to the offshoring location, and the level of noise in the firm's performance function. In particular, the difficulties of interpreting performance signals in noisy situations suggest that there are benefits of making changes to the configuration after the offshoring implementation (host-based learning). In contrast, when coordination costs and distance dominate, the strategy of gearing the organization for offshoring prior to separating them across country borders prevails (home-based learning). Thus, by formalizing these two learning strategies for acquiring architectural knowledge in offshoring, we show that important contingencies can lead to significant performance trade-offs in the search for new organizational configurations that span international borders. © 2016 INFORMS.","Adaptation; Architectural knowledge; Coordination cost; Noisy search; Offshoring",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016876512

Customers, workers, investors, authorities, neighbours, suppliers and various interest groups, for instance NGOs. However, during the last decades, phenomena such as the financial crisis, the global warming, the disasters of global consumerism in terms of the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory in the fashion industry, are examples of how the stakeholder concept cannot continue to be defined as narrow as corporations usually does. The butterfly effect of globalism has shown to be - yes, global. Even the smallest company, the single consumer and the tiniest decision made by anyone may in the future - perhaps even tomorrow - affect stakeholders, we didn't know existed. The future generation is also to be considered as stakeholders, which decisions made today may affect. Companies, consumers, everyday people including children already know this even from the first day at school if not before. What we need is not knowledge about these phenomena - it is how to think globally when we decide locally: in companies, in daily households, in education of our future generations. This chapter discusses how to revise the stakeholder concept according to corporate responsibility, company stakeholding and globalism. It points to shortcomings in various global trade systems such as banking, fashion and IT markets, and through these it suggests and discusses a new way of defining the stakeholder concept in a globalised and future perspective considering using the RESIST-model against 'business-as-usual' based on the butterfly effect of the smallest decision. © 2016 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Butterfly effect; Complexity theory; Global markets; Globalism; Governance; Stakeholder management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015307974

The research question is thus, “How does the value creation logic of Internet firms influence their internationalisation process?”. Design/methodology/approach: The authors answer this question using three cases illustrating the internationalisation process of three pure play digital service firms, each falling into one value creation logic. Findings: Each case company had a different approach to internationalisation, explained by a different theory. The firms differed in what their motivation was to internationalise, how they dealt with their liability of foreignness and how they learnt to internationalise. The differences were consistent with the specificities of their value creation. The contribution of this paper is to take the first steps towards linking the way firms create value with their internationalisation. What theory best explains the internationalization of IFs seems contingent on what firms do. Practical implications: The message to practitioners is that international strategy not only can but also needs to be different across firms. It needs to be tailored to the concrete way a firm endeavours to generate and capture value. “One strategy fits most” is unlikely to succeed, because different value propositions demand different approaches to realising them. Originality/value: In extant literature, IFs have been treated as one group, albeit distinct from “offline” firms. This paper proposes that the value creation process of IFs causes them to differ from each other, just as much as they differ from traditional firms. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","E-business; E-service; Internationalization; Internet firms; Service sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015293006

Design/methodology/approach: A pre-existing SEER2 model, referred to as the Springboard to SEER2, is put under the microscope to determine specific interactions of supply chain proficiency with six key areas of the Springboard: triple top-line strategy and governance; strategy execution via policies, processes and partnerships; financial and marketplace performance and impact; sustainability performance and impact; human ecology and capital performance and impact; and social-ecological and general innovation and continuous improvement performance and impact.

Our central claim is that the visitor moved from being onsite within the museum’s information space to being outside the museum in the online information space of the Internet. This has fundamental implications for the institutional role of museums, our understanding of metadata and the methods of documentation. The onsite museum institution will, eventually, not be able to function as an institutional entity on the Internet, for in this new information space, objects, collections and museums, all function as independent components in a vast universe of data, side by side at everyone’s disposal at anytime. Potentially, users can access cultural heritage anytime, anywhere and anyhow. © The Author(s) 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013115061

In the 21st century the world faces epochal changes which affect every part of society, including the arenas in which cultural heritage is made, held, collected, curated, exhibited, or simply exists. The book is about these changes; about the decentring of culture and cultural heritage away from institutional structures towards the individual; about the questions which the advent of digital technologies is demanding that we ask and answer in relation to how we understand, collect and make available Europe’s cultural heritage. Cultural heritage has enormous potential in terms of its contribution to improving the quality of life for people, understanding the past, assisting territorial cohesion, driving economic growth, opening up employment opportunities and supporting wider developments such as improvements in education and in artistic careers. Given that spectrum of possible benefits to society, the range of studies that follow here are intended to be a resource and stimulus to help inform not just professionals in the sector but all those with an interest in cultural heritage. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2016.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013059406

TD was founded by the government in response to the country’s decline in international standings. This study examines how Denmark’s international performance has developed in the global sporting arms race since then. It analyses how a small nation can improve its international competitiveness despite stagnating funding and growing international competition. The paper argues that the establishment of TD in 1984 is a key factor behind Denmark’s success in elite sport. Measured in absolute terms, by a market share approach, and adjusted for differences in population, wealth, religion and relevant political factors, it is evident that Denmark is performing well and appears to be competitive. Denmark is now the leading nation in Scandinavia and is doing better than almost all other smaller countries in the Summer Olympic disciplines. By examining the development of Danish elite sport policies, the paper shows how the establishment of TD has created an elite sport structure that has helped Denmark to bounce back from its previous decline. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Elite sport systems; Global sporting arms race; Medal standings; SPLISS study; Summer Olympic Games; Team Danmark",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013018776

Design/methodology/approach: Based on the proposed framework, a five-phase methodology was adapted to explore the essential barrier step by step. The common barriers, which were collected from the existing literatures through a systematic review, were further validated by field experts. The collected common barriers were evaluated with the assistance of the case industry’s field professionals through an analytical hierarchy process, a multi-criteria decision-making tool, to evaluate the barriers to Indian offshore wind energy. Findings: Among the 12 common barriers to offshore wind energy, it is clear that “high capital cost” is the most essential barrier involved in the implementation of offshore wind energy farms in the Indian context. Practical implications: This study reveals the importance of offshore wind power as a long-term profitable strategy to the case company within the Indian context. By addressing the essential barriers to the implementation of offshore wind farms, the Indian offshore wind system managers can train their employees to counteract the hindrances through the benchmarking of pioneering global offshore wind power developers such as Denmark and the UK. Further, this study provides useful suggestions to the Indian Government regarding policies for offshore wind energy; it also clearly projects the current status of the Indian offshore wind farm implementation. Originality/value: This study assists Indian key stakeholders of offshore wind energy by indicating the essential barrier in an Indian context; they can remove the particular barrier instead of focusing on others that previous studies have identified. Further, this study brings out the importance of offshore wind power in an Indian context, which can urge stakeholders to invest more in offshore wind farms. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Group discussion; Indian offshore wind energy barriers; Keywords Decision-making; Mail questionnaires; MCDM; Stakeholder meetings; Wind","Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Electric utilities; Human resource management; Surveys; Wind; Wind power; Group discussions; Mail questionnaires; MCDM; Off-shore wind energy; Stakeholder meetings; Offshore wind farms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010705319

This paper aims to introduce a conceptual framework from a supply chain management (SCM) perspective, aimed at promoting the reduction of CoE in the offshore wind energy industry. Design/methodology/approach: Using conceptual arguments from current academic literature in SCM, a comprehensive framework is presented that clarifies how SCM practices can be used by offshore wind energy industry to reduce CoE. Findings: The offshore wind energy sector is a young industry that must reduce CoE to compete with other forms of energy. Applying a supply chain perspective in the offshore wind industry has hitherto been limited to the academic community. This paper offers a SCM framework that includes three interdependent aspects of reducing CoE – innovation, industrialization and supplier partnering – to guide the industry towards sources to reduce CoE. Research limitations/implications: SCM is a broad research area; thus, the presented framework to reduce the CoE is open for further development. Practical implications: The paper provides insights into how the CoE can be reduced through innovation, industrialization and partnering in the offshore wind energy supply chain.

Recent research shows that operations and maintenance (O&M) account for around 20-35 per cent of the total energy costs in this sector. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of O&M issues in the offshore wind energy sector to propose initiatives that can help reduce the cost of energy used by offshore wind farms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an in-depth literature review and a Delphi study of a panel of 16 experts on O&M. Findings: Consisting primarily of conceptual papers and/or modelling papers, the extant literature identifies several challenges for O&M in the offshore wind energy sector. These challenges can be grouped into four categories: issues related with industry immatureness; distance/water depth; weather window; and policy issues. The Delphi study identified three other major issues that lead to increased O&M costs: too many predefined rules that limit development; lack of coordinated planning of the different services offered at the wind farms; and lack of a common approach on how O&M should be managed strategically. Research limitations/implications: The present study is based only on Danish respondents. Future research needs to include various respondents from different countries to identify country-specific contingencies. Practical implications: The paper provides an overview of the O&M issues in the offshore wind energy sector to prioritize where future resources should be invested and, thus, reduce O&M costs.

The purpose of this paper is to identify academic discoveries that could provide offshore wind projects with means to overcome their current supply chain challenges. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive literature review was conducted involving 162 articles published in 29 peer-reviewed journals. The papers were analyzed in terms of the dimensions of SCI, research methodology, unit of analysis, level of analysis, type of industry and manufacturing environment being studied, integrative practices, integrative barriers and the link between SCI and performance. Findings: While SCI has been evolving to become an influential topic in the field of supply chain management, scholars have overlooked industrial contingencies by ignoring the differences between the studied industrial contexts, especially project-based manufacturing environments. The present review also reveals that no study of SCI has been conducted on the construction of renewable energy projects. Another finding is that case studies and research articles using networks as a unit of analysis are underrepresented.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual framework linking national and organizational cultures to employees’ job satisfaction, job characteristics, organizational commitment and organizational performance was developed, and their measurement scales were adapted to guide the empirical investigation. Data were collected using a questionnaire filled in by 300 employees in nine retail banks in Ghana. The results were first analyzed by carrying out data reduction of the measured scales by using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences-based factor analysis approach. The reduced data obtained from the factor analysis were then analyzed for model goodness fit by using the Analysis of Moment Structures-based structural equation modeling approach. Findings: Effective organizational performance of retail banks in Ghana is directly influenced by the relationships among organizational culture, employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications: The study sample was drawn from a single sub-sector of the Ghanaian economy.

This chapter presents the profile and trends of the academic discipline of FTA and its approaches. This is achieved through analyses of the development, focus and scientific impact of FTA. As such, this chapter contributes to the discussion on the conceptual development and academic positioning of FTA (or Foresight). The chapter is based on bibliometric analyses of the special issues of five international journals published after the FTA conferences in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2011: Technological Forecasting and Social Change, Futures, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, Science and Public Policy, and Foresight. Methodologically, the paper draws on the principles of Elsevier’s Scopus and Thompson Reuter’s Web of Science. The chapter concludes that the field of FTA seems to have remained remarkably stable over the last decade. As an academic field, FTA has targeted a small number of journals for its publications, which has helped to further define and focus the field. Finally, the chapter concludes that publications in special issues of international journals resulting from the FTA conferences have a similar level of quality and scientific impact as articles published in standard issues of these journals. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Academic discipline; Foresight; FTA; Publications; Trends",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010009133

In the original paper AMTs were analysed within the context of the Strategically Flexible Production (SFP). The use and effectiveness of various technologies and their computer-based integration were investigated in the light of the emerging paradigm. Data from the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey have shown that the use of integrating technologies varied much within the core adopters of the paradigm, suggesting that SFP did not necessarily require massive information technology support. However, SFP alone or combined with a higher level of integration of stand-alone AMT fostered increased time responsiveness. The commentary suggests that today very similar hypotheses to the ones tested in the original paper could be explored in relation to the currently emerging technologies, such as Industry 4.0 or Smart Factories. In particular we need to ask questions and test propositions around the need of alignment between today’s advanced technologies and work organization practices, and around the relative importance of technology compared to organization in building superior capabilities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009688949

The case study stresses that characteristics of family firms can be exploited in the homeland production mode and lead to reduced agency costs and social capital benefits. Furthermore, the case study highlights that there are important aspects to consider regarding the way in which these characteristics affect agency costs and social capital, and how these effects are influenced by the production locational mode. From this, it is concluded that arguments from agency theory and socio-emotional wealth theory can explain family firm advantages associated with the homeland production mode.

The analysis points to the fact that changes have taken place including more of a work-first approach and increasing pressure on those receiving social benefits, whereas with regard to investments in social services and social capital, this is still high on the agenda and continues, despite the crisis, to have a universal approach and focus. The expected change in demography has particularly been used to explain some of the reasons for the changes, although the fiscal constraints on the welfare state have also played a role. The Danish welfare state has seemingly also, in a gradual way, moved away from its strong focus on equality and generosity regarding welfare benefits, with the exception of pensions. At the same time the focus on core social services such as for children, the elderly and health care still seems to prevail.

Particular attention is given to balance of payments deficits and surpluses, and the profound difficulties of rebalancing the Euro area. Throughout the chapters, the author argues that the EMU has failed to support an optimal currency area with the correct institutional arrangements due to misunderstandings at a macroeconomic level. The author also sheds light on the stability pact and the resulting macroeconomic trap which has left a number of Eurozone countries with devastatingly high rates of unemployment. The book argues that by disregarding important macroeconomic imbalances, Euro-monetarists have derailed the entire Eurozone project to such an extent that it is at risk of falling apart. Key chapters discuss the establishment of the EMU from a Euro-realist perspective and the role of the European Central Bank in rebalancing financial markets. The concluding chapter looks ahead to the future of the Euro and proposes necessary institutional solutions to the macroeconomic problems it is currently facing.

In this paper dealing with criteria, we concentrate only on the objectives viewpoint and leave the attributes discussion for future research. The two most crucial questions are: What are the objectives of measurement in radical design? What are the most crucial future challenges related to the selection of relevant measurement objectives? Based on the theoretical part of this paper, our framework of the Balanced Design Front-End Model (BDFEM) for measuring the innovation activities front-end contains five assessment viewpoints; input, process, output (including i), social environment and structural environment.

Advancing prior research on routine dynamics, this study examines how inertia in routines influences the process of organizational adaptation, both in the absence and presence of endogenous change of routines. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our analysis suggests an overlooked mechanism by which routine-level inertia may help, rather than hinder, organization-level adaptation. We demonstrate this mechanism by using a simple theoretical model in which the organization is characterized as a configuration of interdependent routines and study the process by which this configuration adapts to cope with its task environment. We find that inertia in routines may engender potentially useful variation in the process of organizational adaptation because reduced rates of routine-level changes may lead to temporal reordering when these changes are implemented. In our nuanced perspective, inertia is not only a consequence of adaptation or selection as perceived in prior research, but also a source of variation that turns out to be useful for adaptation. This logic is helpful to better understand why apparently inertial organizations keep surviving and from time to time exhibit outstanding performance. We conclude by discussing how this advanced understanding of the role of routines in organizational adaptation helps elaborate the theory of economic evolution. © 2016 INFORMS.","Evolutionary theory; Organizational adaptation; Organizational change; Organizational inertia; Organizational routines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008398413

However, as DEA is gaining popularity in regulation and normative budgeting, the strategic interest of the evaluated industry calls for attention. We offer endogenous general prices based on a reformulation of DEA where the units collectively propose the set of weights that maximize their efficiency. Thus, the sector-wide efficiency is then a result of compromising the scores of more specialized smaller units, which also gives a more stable set of weights. The potential application could be to precipitate collective bargaining on cost efficiency under regulation with asymmetric information on relative prices and costs. The models are applied to paneldata from 285 Danish district heating plants, where the open evaluation of multiple non-priced outputs is relevant. The results show that sector wide weighting schemes favor input/output combinations that are less variable than would individual units. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","DEA; Efficiency; Weights",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007415250

It is argued that the rebound effect is both a natural consequence of the growth dedicated society and a driver of further economic growth. Through rebound effects, labour productivity and eco-efficiency technologies in the growth society tend to contradict the goal of achieving environmental sustainability. To address the environmental problems, attention should therefore be redirected to the growth ideology and policy in current society. Drawing on the emerging degrowth debates in the affluent countries, the chapter proposes pathways towards a degrowth transformation by, respectively, discussing the role of population, affluence and technology in the attempts at reducing environmental impacts. Overall, it is suggested that from an analysis not confined to monetary terms, but with real cost and real benefits represented by environmental damage and human satisfaction, respectively, a degrowth in affluent countries can be achieved at no net cost. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Degrowth; Delusion of decoupling; I = PAT; Rebound effect",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006427093

And how do we learn to become such productive and even innovative leaders? This paper will argue that dissolving conventional hegemonies of what constitutes true leadership, embracing the unforeseen of everyday work practices, and regarding diversity as an important resource may prove to show new paths for leadership development. Many scholars and leaders have looked in the direction of situated learning theory to develop our understanding of good leadership. The study’s literature review reveals on one hand a body of pre- and descriptive applications of situated learning theory shadowing analytic potential. On the other hand, it reveals a line of substantial analytical contributions to the field of leadership development. Analysing two empirical leadership cases through the lens of situated learning theory, the study unfolds examples of ‘losing control’ and letting practice itself lead the way. Learning to become (more of a) leader seems to constitute an integral part of everyday changing practice. The study illuminates an unexploited potential for enhancing our analytic focus on the improvisational, diverse, and non-hegemonic aspects of leadership practice and on how this is developed: Leadership ‘embracing the unpredictable’. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Community of practice; Improvisation; Leadership; Participation; Situated learning theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006386629

The answer comes in three parts: Yes, no and maybe. By studying the use of a game to teach change management in the light of adult learning theory, the article discusses how different kinds of learning processes emerge and contribute. On the basis of qualitative interviews and observation, a case study is used to explore how the particular, didactic orchestration of a game-based learning process, together with emergent, informal learning processes, contributes to leadership learning. As participants are immersed in formal, non-formal and informal learning processes, these processes contribute to improving leadership in practice in a variety of different ways. The article concludes that (1) yes, game-based learning does contribute to teaching operational leadership in a formal manner; (2) no, in and of itself, the formal learning of games has a limited impact on leadership learning, but in combination with other didactic activities, its contribution is profound and (3) maybe, since by tapping into the extensive knowledge of other participants, games inspire informal discussions on leadership topics that are not directly relevant to the game, but are in other ways beneficial. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Business games; Formal; Informal; Leadership learning; Non-formal",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006371489

The paper is based on an empirical study of a leadership development programme, ‘Start to Lead’, in a global organization. Through our empirical analysis, we infer two modes of ordering, which illustrate how the assessment tool produced diverse performative effects across different practices. Our findings indicate a gap between the participants’ interview-based descriptions of what they learned from the programme and the assessment tool’s operationalization of ‘the right’ leadership knowledge. We also found that managers seemed to distinguish between assessment important to the managers themselves and their daily work, which they were highly motivated to do well, and assessment important to ‘the organizational system’, which mostly resulted in quickly ‘ticking boxes’. These findings suggest that assessment tools work as demarcations defining good leadership and legitimate learning. These demarcations risk being disconnected from the everyday practice of leadership and hence risk decoupling the assessment tool and the participants’ everyday leadership practice. We end the paper by discussing the theoretical implications of this analysis. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Assessment tools; Identification; Leadership development; Performativity; Practice; Social science methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006355112

Innovation summits have recently appeared in practice as a new approach by which firms strategically market and further their open innovation agendas both internally and externally. Design/methodology/approach: To advance the knowledge of this novel phenomenon, which has not yet been described in theory, a qualitative research design is appropriate. Consequently, this research conducts comparative case studies of four leading companies. Findings: The paper contributes knowledge on how innovation summits can be designed and used as a strategic marketing approach to mobilise and match key people for open innovation. The authors find that the strategic scope and cognitive distance of invited firms are critical dimensions in characterising distinct types of innovation summits and propose a classification scheme for understanding different types of summits. Practical implications: For practitioners, the authors present two central questions to consider before staging a summit: what is the strategic scope and who should be involved? This classification scheme offers managers an understanding of the implications of these choices. Originality/value: While much research takes a macro-perspective on open innovation, much less is known about the micro-level of bringing parties together. In practise, the concept of innovation summits has gained a significant interest; however, the concept is still relatively unknown in the literature.

We propose the notion of 'existentialized sustainability' as a possible way forward. Methodology/approach - We take the Heideggerian perspective that death may bring individual and societal time into a common framework. From here, we compare anthropological and consumer culture research on funerary rites in non-modern societies with contemporary societies of the DSP. Findings - Funerary rites reveal important insights into how individuals relate to their respective societies. Individuals are viewed as important contributors to the maintenance and regeneration of the group in non-modern societies. In contrast, funerary rites for individuals in the DSP are private, increasingly informal, and unconnected to sustaining society at large. This analysis reveals clear parallels between the goals of sustainability and the values of non-modern funerary rites. Social implications - We propose the metaphor of a funerary rite for sustainability to promote consciousness towards societal futures. The idea is to improve 'quality of death' through sustainability - in other words, the 'existentialization of sustainability'. This opens up a possible strategy for marketers to actively contribute to a societal shift towards a New Environmental Paradigm (NEP). Originality/value - The Heideggerian approach is a novel way to identify and reconcile the epistemic contradictions between sustainability and marketing. This diagnosis suggests a way in which marketing can address the wicked problem of global sustainability challenges, perhaps allowing a new spirituality in consumption.

Furthermore, the paper analyses the impact of shifts in cropping pattern on water and land use in China's grain production. An index decomposition analysis framework is employed to calculate the corresponding contributions. The research relies on grain production data at both national and provincial levels during 2003-2012. The results show that besides the effects of area sown and pure yield changes, cropping pattern adjustment has also played an important role in promoting China's grain production, with a contribution of over 15 per cent during 2003-2012. Moreover, such changes enabled to save about 6.8 million hectares of sown areas and 31.06 billion m3 of water in grain production (if compared to the case without cropping pattern adjustments).

While games and simulations have long been used in management training and leadership development, emphasis has been placed on the formal parts of the process and especially on the gaming experience. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a qualitative study of a French management game on change management, in which the game-based learning process is examined in light of adult learning. Findings: This paper concludes that less formal dialogues that stem from formal activities make important contributions to the learning process. Consequently, the use of business games in leadership development should be didactically designed to facilitate such dialogues. While playing the game takes center stage, activities such as theory presentations, reflective processes, and less formal discussions must be allowed a place in an otherwise crammed learning process and to take up that space at the cost of playing the game. Research limitations/implications: As the study is based on a qualitative assessment, the impact of the different parts of the process is not assessed. Practical implications: This paper suggests that the use of business games in leadership development should focus more on the processes and activities surrounding the game rather than narrowly focusing on the game. Originality/value: This paper suggests a novel approach to using business games that is not aligned with the current practice of emphasizing the game as the focal point of the process. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business games; Engagement and learning; Formal and less formal learning processes; Leadership development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999652143

Design/methodology/approach: This is studied through of observations of work practices in the newsroom and through documentary research and qualitative interviews with managers, editors, and other professionals. Findings: It is shown that management devices such as the news table and the news concept are central to the reorganization of news work, as they realize managers’ strategies, just like they produce new practices and power relationships. It is shown that the devices produce increased collaboration among journalists and interaction between managers and output journalists, that mundane work and power is delegated to technological devices and that news products are increasingly standardized. Practical implications: The wider implications of these findings seem to be a change in the journalistic profession: TV news journalism is becoming less individualistic and more collective and professionalism becomes a matter of understanding and realizing the news organization’s strategy, rather than following a more individual agenda. Originality/value: The paper’s originality lies in showing that profession and management are not opposed to each other, but can be seen as a continuum on which journalistic and managerial tasks become intertwined. This is in contrast to previous research on news work. Furthermore, the paper’s focus on devices opens up for conceptualizing power in the newsroom as distributed across a network of people and things, rather executed by managers alone. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital newsroom; Digital technologies; Journalists; Management devices; News production; Professions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84999622467

Dialogic conversations are defined as sequences of communicative actions and counteractions taken by social actors for different purposes based on specific linguistic choices and characterised by diverse communicative approaches and the role played by the involved parties. Design/methodology/approach: A multidimensional scale for measuring dialogic conversations is developed from relevant literature concerning dialogue and public engagement in the fields of corporate communication, public relations, management studies and conversation analysis. The scale is built on three main dimensions: organisation turn-taking, sequencing of conversation, repair strategies and procedures. A pilot study was conducted to purify it from irrelevant variables. Findings: Results of the pilot study show a general good level of reliability for the majority of the proposed variables for Facebook but not for Twitter. This may indicate that Facebook is a more dialogical forum than Twitter. Originality/value: This is the first study proposing a systematic measurement of the dialogue orientation of online conversations that takes into consideration the role of language and communicative actions.

However, in 2013, it was discovered that 19,000 females had been unsubscribed from the Danish National Cervical Cancer Screening Program and had thus not received invitations or reminders as recommended by the health authorities. The study aims to report the essence of this adverse event and describe the outcomes of reestablishing invitations in terms of participation rates and screening results. Furthermore, patient compensations to affected females diagnosed with cervical cancer and coverage in the mass media was reported. Methods: An observational study based on information from the Danish Pathology Databank, the Department of Public Health Programs, and Infomedia (a Danish database of media coverage) was carried out. Results: A total of 19,106 females were affected. Of those still in the screening age, 37.7% had been tested within 3 years or 5 years despite not receiving any invitation. A total of 21.6% reconfirmed their status as unsubscribed. Of the remaining females, 55.6% were tested within a year, and 94.6% of these test results were normal. Among females aged >64 years, 12.7% accepted the offer of a final screening test. Totally, 90% of these tests were normal. Nineteen females diagnosed with cervical cancer were compensated by the Danish Patient Compensation Association with a total of €693,000, ranging from €8,900 to €239,700. Coverage of cervical cancer screening in the mass media increased from 25 items in the 3 months prior to this adverse event to 590 items in the month when it became public. Conclusion: Even though more than one-third of the affected females were tested despite not receiving regular invitations to participate in the screening program, lacking invitations were ranked alongside other adverse events in the health care system if cancer diagnoses were delayed. © 2016 Larsen et al.","Adverse event; Mass screening; Uterine cervical neoplasms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995677912

It shows how devices interact in defending, rejecting and reframing strategy, leading to the closure of the SSC to pave the way for new strategic ideas. Design/methodology/approach - It uses a longitudinal case-based approach, which draws on actor-network theory, particularly Callon's (1998) notions of framing and overflowing. These notions help describe strategic events and processes by highlighting the active role of non-human entities, such as management devices, in enacting and reformulating strategy. Findings - Different devices have become key actants in shaping and formulating the new strategy in the municipality and the strategic decision to construct an SSC. However, different devices mobilise different localities that protest, reject and participate in the closure of the SSC through a reframing strategy. Research limitations/implications - The study is subject to the general limitations of case-based research. Thus, the propositions should be further investigated to elaborate the performative role of management devices. Practical implications - The findings facilitate a deeper understanding of factors triggering strategic development in the public sector. Also, it identifies aspects leading to failures by investigating how different devices allow local actors to stay connected and affect the SSC's creation.

Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the objectives of the paper, a conventional approach involving literature review, framework development, and data collection and analysis was used to conceptualise the organisation of a value chain association in a developing country context. Findings: The study finds rationale for a value chain-based business association based on the literature review, observations and discussions from the stakeholder workshop. Research limitations/implications: It has been suggested that upgrading the currently fragmented dried fruit and vegetable value chain to encompass all value chain actors might have implications towards “creativity”, “innovation” and “entrepreneurial abilities” along the value chain, i.e. resources and competences that could enhance the value of the market offer and thus the competitiveness of the whole value chain. A value chain-based business association might be one of the stepping-stones to enhance innovative and entrepreneurial abilities for strong and competitive value chain activities. Originality/value: If the literature has been relatively silent on business associations understood primarily as industry associations, it has been completely silent on value chain associations.

NPL handling tools and methods currently used by the banks are not efficient enough to significantly reduce the NPL ratio and keep it within safe and sustainable limits. This paper analyses the current state and causes of NPLs in retail banking and the ways of improving their handling efficiency. An idea that retail banks should not only focus on administrative handling methods, but also actively promote financial awareness and especially rational consumer behaviour of clients as measures preventing the NPL, is presented. The idea is based on a synthesis of research results performed within three segments, which shape the background of the problem: first, the current NPL situation in retail banking, theoretical framework and methods of their control, second, the budgetary and borrower performance of households and contemporary trends within consumer behaviour and, third, the NPL determinants, evaluation and comparison of their impact. Recommendations for retail banks to invest into preventive NPL reducing measures and run them parallel to the currently used “follow-up” type NPL handling tools are developed. The recommendations are supported by simulation of payback potential of investment by using specially developed algorithm.

Design/methodology/approach: Outcomes are examined using: static multinomial logit analysis, and structural dynamic discrete choice modelling. The latter approach, coupled with the quality of the RAIS-Migra data source, allows the authors to evaluate the education policy impacts over time. Findings: The main results show that the education level raises the propensity that the individual will be in formal sector work or still in education, and reduces the probability of the other outcomes. Transition into non-manual formal sector work following education may, however, occur via a spell of manual work. Originality/value: This is the first study of occupational destination to be conducted in a rapidly developing country using high-quality panel data and appropriate dynamic methods, and as such makes an important contribution in confirming that increased supply of highly skilled workers enhances occupational attainment in this context. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Development; Dynamics; Education; Occupation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992199807

Design/methodology/approach: First, after a literature review on MNCs’ strategy and process standardization, the study suggests two propositions on the fit between corporate international management strategy and process standardization. Second, to empirically examine the propositions, the study investigates the outcome of process standardization in three cases with different strategic and structural contexts. Third, using the propositions and empirical findings, the study proposes a framework for aligning process standardization with MNCs’ structural characteristics. Findings: Process standardization has a higher degree of fit in MNCs pursuing global integration where process standardization parallels the need for coordinating interdependencies in the functional structure, and is consistent with the headquarters’ operational control over the subsidiaries. Process standardization has a lower degree of fit in MNCs seeking local responsiveness as process standardization disturbs the financial control relationship between the headquarters and subsidiaries and is less crucial for coordination as the subsidiaries contain the necessary coordination mechanisms. Originality/value: The study provides in-depth understanding of how the international management strategy and consequent structural characteristics of MNCs affects process standardization in the course of a global enterprise resource planning implementation.

Owners, consultants, and contractors all have diverse opinions and interests, but they all seek to ensure project success. Success is habitually measured as performance output regarding cost, time, and quality. Despite previous research mapping the success and failure factors, construction managers seem to have difficulty in attaining success. To provide clearer guidance on how to fulfill success criteria, the purpose of this paper is to identify the underlying factors that affect performance and thus project success in construction processes. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey based on a literature review provided 25 key process factors divided into five key categories. Based on the responses from commonly involved construction parties, the factors were ranked and tested for significant differences between the parties. Findings - The top fivemost important process factors were found to relate to the sharing of knowledge and communication. Moreover, testing the ranking for significant differences between owners, consultants, and contractors revealed five differences. The differences related to the interpretation and importance of trust, shared objectives, project coordination, and alternative forms of coordination. Originality/value - All respondents identify improved knowledge sharing and communication as the key to improved cost, time, and quality performance and are therefore the areas where construction managers need to focus their resources. Thus, improved experience sharing and communication will increase the likelihood of project success, through improving competences, commitment, and coordination. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication; Failure factors; Knowledge management; Performance; Success factors","Communication; Contractors; Knowledge management; Managers; Surveys; Construction manager; Construction process; Construction projects; Design/methodology/approach; Failure factors; Performance; Questionnaire surveys; Success factors; Management science",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991698840

However, there is a lack of clarity on pertinent integration approaches suggesting that integration is more complex and dynamic than traditionally assumed. In this chapter, we shed light on ambiguous cause effect relationships by investigating the effect of integration related decisions on intermediate goals. Additionally, we argue that entrepreneurial integration skills, or proactivity under ambiguity, are needed to keep pace with the dynamism inherent in acquisition integration. Based on primary data on 116 acquisitions, we find that entrepreneurial integration skills can display both advantages and disadvantages. While it helps to realize expected and serendipitous synergies, it can also trigger employee uncertainty due to decreased transparency. In supplementary analysis, we show measures to outperform with various integration approaches.

Drawing on social dilemma and self-determination theory, the purpose of this paper is to understand what factors drive employees’ participation and what factors hamper their participation in enterprise social media. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a literature review, a unified research model is derived integrating demographic, individual, organizational and technological factors that influence the motivation of employees to share knowledge. The model is tested using statistical methods on a sample of 114 respondents in Denmark. Qualitative data are used to elaborate and explain quantitative findings. Findings: The findings pinpoint towards the general drivers and barriers to knowledge sharing within organizations. The significant drivers to knowledge sharing are: enjoy helping others, monetary rewards, management support, management encourages and motivates knowledge sharing behavior and knowledge sharing is recognized. The significant identified barriers are: change of behavior, lack of trust and lack of time. Practical implications: The proposed knowledge sharing framework helps to understand what factors impact engagement on social media.

The authors designate this as the distributed leadership agency (DLA). Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected throughout all departments and occupational groups at a merged centralized hospital setting in Denmark. A total of 1,774 employees from 24 hospital departments and 16 occupational groups completed our survey. Structural equation model and confirmatory factor analyses were applied to identify appropriate items and a test for measurement invariance, predictive, discriminant and convergent validity, and ANOVAs were applied to analyse group differences in DLA. Findings: The identified unidimensional questionnaire consists of seven items, as it is different from, but associated with, empowering leadership, organizational influence, attitude to participation and trust in management. As theoretically predicted, DLA is positively related to self-efficacy, job satisfaction and innovative behaviour. Chief physicians, permanent employees and employee representatives scored higher on the scale than the rest of their respective counterparts. Practical implications: The survey offers a method to assess a distribution of leadership agency in hospital organizations. Such assessment may provide a basis for organizational and leadership development. Originality/value: The present study provides a reliable and valid quantitative instrument that measures how much employees at all hierarchical levels are involved in concrete leadership activities in the hospital context. Taking a normative perspective the authors could show that DL – measured with the DLA-questionnaire – has positive effects on employees’ behaviour. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decentralization; Distributed leadership; Employee involvement; Hospital management; Research methods","Denmark; female; hospital management; human; leadership; male; personnel management; questionnaire; Denmark; Female; Hospital Administration; Humans; Leadership; Male; Management Quality Circles; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988946702

Design/methodology/approach: Based on insights from the industrial organization tradition and strategic management, the paper brings the original insights of the oligopolistic industry perspective into a modern context by outlining a conceptual framework that may guide future international business (IB) research on MNC strategy in oligopolistic industries. Findings: This paper demonstrates how contemporary IB literature pays little attention to a key insight of the early IB literature, namely, that foreign direct investment (FDI) often is driven by strategic interaction among MNCs in oligopolistic industries. Instead, the contemporary IB literature focuses on the FDI as a way to reduce transaction costs and/or as a way to leverage and build capabilities across borders.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model is developed by extending the theory of reasoned action framework to include WOM and emotions. The conceptual model is operationalized through a structural equation model, and the model is estimated and tested by using the partial least squares method. A survey among 509 consumers in Denmark forms the empirical basis for the study. Findings: The paper finds that positive and negative WOM has an asymmetric influence on emotions, behavioral attitude and intention, i.e. that consumers respond differently to positive and negative WOM. The paper also finds that positive WOM has a larger impact than the social norm on behavioral attitude and intention and that negative WOM has an impact equal to that of the social norm. Furthermore, the study finds that emotions are an important mediator for both WOM and social norm. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited to a large travel agency in Denmark.

Design/methodology/approach: First connectedness is re-described as an actor-perceived and actor-interpreted phenomenon. The re-description is used to theorize the triad value function. Next, the applicability and validity of the concept is examined in a case study of four closed vertical supply chain triads. Findings: The case study demonstrates that the triad value function facilitates the analysis and understanding of an apparent paradox; that distributors are not dis-intermediated in spite of their limited contribution to activities in the triads. The results indicate practical adequacy of the triad value function. Research limitations/implications: The triad value function is difficult to apply in the study of expanded networks as the number of connections expands exponentially with the number of ties in the network. Moreover, it must be applied in the study of service triads and open vertical supply chain triads to further verify the practical adequacy of the concept. Practical implications: The triad value function cannot be used normatively or prescriptively. It is a descriptive tool which indirectly supports managerial decision-making through the analysis of how the structural context of a triad influences the value of relationships. Originality/value: The paper offers an additional aspect for the study of value in and of triads. It illustrates that perceived connectedness of relationships operates as a triad value function, which captures the structural value potential of the triad for a focal actor. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Connectedness; Connection; Subjectivity; Triads; Value; Value potential",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988354288

The purpose of this paper is to develop a structural and comprehensive toolbox of available BM configurations, from which companies can choose, to innovate their BM upon, and to design an appropriate BM innovation framework which can facilitate them in re-designing, selecting, and implementing new BM configuration possibilities. Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review is conducted to identify all the relevant BM configurations. Then, a value driver analysis is performed to group these BM configurations into appropriate categories. Finally, an ontological classification scheme and a structural and workable process, i.e. a BM innovation framework, are inductively developed. Findings: The paper systematically develops a list of 71 BM configurations and groups them into an ontological classification scheme according to five groups: Value Proposition, Value Segment, Value Configuration, Value Network, and Value Capture. The paper illustrates how the BM innovation framework, enabled by this ontological classification scheme, provides a platform for identifying BM innovation routes for companies, allowing managers to envisage radical, disruptive, and new-to-the-world BM configuration ideas, or apply existing configurations from other industrial settings in what may be deemed new-to-the-industry innovation. Originality/value: The paper enriches the amount of potential BM configurations available for managers to choose from when innovating their BMs, and extends the analysis to five core BM configuration categories. Moreover, the BM innovation framework suggested highlights the strong relationships among the value drivers, thus presenting the opportunity for managers to assess potential conflicts or synergies between various value drivers, and to align the BM management process as a whole. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business model configurations; Business model innovation; Ontologies; Value drivers",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988345781

However, these tasks are not systematically managed and are often extended due to missing information or equipment or staff unavailability. This research aims to assess whether ward rounds can be structured more efficiently and effectively from the perspective of patients and staff. Design/methodology/approach: This mixed-method approach examines the ward rounds conducted in three units within a haematology department of a major Danish hospital. Baseline measures were collected to capture the value of the ward round described by patients and staff. The information on patient and equipment flows associated with a typical ward round was mapped with recommendations for improvement. Findings: Staff aspired to deliver a good-quality ward round, but what this meant was never articulated and there were no established standards. The duration of the ward round was unpredictable and could take 6 hours to complete. Improvements identified by the team allow the ward rounds to be completed by mid-day with much more certainty. Research limitations/implications: This research provides an insight as to how ward rounds are conducted within a Danish haematology department. Practical implications: The research has implications for those involved in ward rounds to reduce the time taken whilst maintaining quality and safety of patient care. Social implications: This research has implications for patients and their families who wish to spend time with consultants. Originality/value: Previous research has focused on the interactions between doctors and nurses. This research focuses on the operational process of the ward round and presents a structured approach to support multi-disciplinary teams with a focus on value from the patient’s perspective. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Healthcare; Improvement; Lean; Multidisciplinary team; Ward round",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988328454

Specifically, this paper uses a subset of the IMSS VI data set from the 606 plants that identified themselves as one of the plants in a manufacturing network. Findings: This paper finds that external integration is significantly related to operational performance of networked plant, whereas internal integration is not. As an enabler for external integration, the influence of internal integration on operational performance of networked plant is mediated by external integration. This paper also provides evidence to the purported positive impact of internal integration on inter-plant coordination, as well as the positive impact of inter-plant coordination on external integration. It further suggests that inter-plant coordination can influence operational performance of networked plant through external integration and also mediate the relationship from internal integration to performance through external integration. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the SCI literature and extends the understanding of the impact of SCI on the operational performance by selecting networked plant as a unit of analysis.

Quality as defined from an industry perspective usually relies on different instrumental assessment and on ratings of “experts” which may not necessarily align with consumers’ perception of quality. The purpose of this paper is to deal with consumers perceptions of intrinsic quality in coffee from a sensory scientific and behavioral economic perspective. Design/methodology/approach: In a blind taste test (n=205), naïve consumers tasted two cups of coffee and decided which they preferred. The two coffees varied greatly in their “objective” quality (based on expert grading) and retail value. Consumers were then revealed that one of the cups contained a coffee that was much more expensive than the other, and that they could get a free cup of their preferred coffee if they could correctly identify the most expensive one. Findings: The results showed that preferences were equally distributed among the high- and low-quality samples, and that consumers did not perform better than chance level in the identification task. These results suggest that current grading systems used in the industry may be poorly correlated with the way consumers actually experience coffee, and thus that quality inference in the marketplace is more likely influenced by external cues (e.g. brand, label and price) than to intrinsic product quality. Nevertheless, the results also show that consumers who correctly answered the identification task were also significantly more likely to prefer the high-quality sample. This tentatively suggests that better sensory expertise is correlated with a preference for higher quality, though future studies are needed to confirm the correctedness of this interpretation. Originality/value: This work highlights the difficulty of objectively defining food quality, and the limited usefulness of experts’ ratings widely used in the industry. Managerial implications of these findings, as well as implications for consumer policy, are discussed. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural economics; Coffee; Consumer studies; Perception; Preference","behavioral economics; coffee; consumer; food quality; human; major clinical study; perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987814968

Findings: Based on the consumer psychographic profiles, three distinct segments are found: involved traditional, involved innovators and ambiguous indifferent, of which the first two constitute especially interesting targets for market positioning strategies for aquaculture products. Practical implications: The results of the segmentation analysis opens new horizons in terms of positioning and differentiation of fish products from the aquaculture industry according to the most important potential market segments.

The directions inspired research and marked a milestone in the development of the field. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the past decade and to rejuvenate these research directions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors propose the umbrella term: “project studies” to denote the research related to projects and temporary organizing. Project studies is conceived not only as a body of research, but also as a social process embedded in research communities, and contemporary Zeitgeist. Based on Sandberg’s interpretative approach to the fit between work and works (in this case research-researcher) and Habermas’ three types of human interests: technical, practical, and emancipatory, the authors develop a conceptual framework circumscribing three types of research in project studies.

This article sets out to investigate the impact of internationalization on performance in the hotel industry. Building on the theory of organizational learning the authors test several hypotheses regarding the shape of the internationalization-performance relationship as well as the impact of four moderating variables. In line with the research aim and the underlying dynamism of organizational learning theory, these hypotheses are tested using a dynamic Bayesian model. The results indicate that internationalization has a U-shaped impact on hotel performance, moderated by cultural distance, regulations and restrictions and the level of development congruence. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for practice and provide directions for future research. ©The Author(s) 2015.","Hotel performance; Internationalization; Organizational learning","Bayesian analysis; globalization; hotel industry; hypothesis testing; learning; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983432511

Yet although scenario planning grew from very hands-on strategy development efforts in the military and from operations research dedicated to solving practical problems, the use of scenarios in business has, in many cases, remained a cumbersome affair. Very often a large group of consultants, employees and staff is involved in the development of scenarios and strategies, thus making the whole process expensive in terms of time, money and human resources. In response, this article uses insights from the area of strategic forecasting (of which scenario planning is a proper subset) and experiences gained from a recent course in that area to develop a simpler, more direct, hands-on method for scenario construction and to provide several ideas for scenario construction that can be used by a broader circle of firms.

Each of these examples shows how participatory hierarchies between employees and between them and action researchers are constructed in OAR projects, leading in these cases to the exclusion of silent pedagogues, elderly foremen, and a critical employee. Based on these examples, the article has three mutually connected purposes, an empirical, theoretical, and methodological purpose. First, the empirical purpose is to show that a participatory approach can unintentionally create new hierarchies or reinforce existing ones, thus leading to the exclusion of certain employees (or action researchers) in terms of voice and/or choice. Second, the theoretical purpose is to show how participation in OAR projects can be understood as a contextualising mechanism. That is, partners and action researchers produce new project contexts by their ways of speaking, acting, and organisng. These new contexts are always already embedded in several simultaneous, organisational and societal contexts. This means that participation in OAR projects works in the interface between communication and organisation. Third, the methodological purpose is to show that handling of these participatory hierarchies ought to become a goal in OAR projects to be included along with producing practical and theoretical results. The article argues that this might contribute to handling participatory hierarchies and power relations in more transparent ways in OAR projects if partners and action researchers decide to do so. © Rainer Hampp Verlag.","Communication; Context; Hierarchy; Organisational action research; Participation; Power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982903478

The study employed case study interview with two petroleum products distributors in Tanzania to achieve its objective. Data were analyzed by thematic analytical techniques. Three major findings regarding buyersuppliers relationships in developing economies are presented: actors do not prefer to enforce contract that they sign, discretional relationships exist in petroleum business among actors and 'undugunization' is the strongest criteria in selection of actors.

Hence, for innovation-based companies, combining social capital and economic capital value through the creation and maintenance of business relationships and networking to obtain value plays a central role for their growth and survival. In this paper we design and evaluate a so-called “network nexus” prototype as an ICT value assessment tool for facilitators of innovation-oriented networks. To determine whether a business network is structured for providing value to its members, the facilitator scores the network based on a survey. The scoring of the nexus gives an indication of what to improve to increase value. Evaluation of the nexus resulted in the identification of six types of networks each with their own potential for value. We conclude that design challenges for ICT assessment tools of business network groups can be overcome but needs to be rooted in their context. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Design science research; Innovation; Network groups; Nexus; Value","Design; Innovation; Business networks; Business relationships; Design challenges; Design-science researches; Economic capital; Nexus; Value; Value assessment; Information systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981320383

I advocate an understanding of meditations as an alternative embodied mode of research that seeks to contemplate how a reflective attention to walking as a reflective engagement in a sensory landscape may be enrolled as embodied ways of knowing. Meditation performs the touristic and mobile body as a porous and affective site. Moving around on foot creates a sensibility that is often ignored when researchers and practitioners in information technology (IT) attend to the field to learn about tourism in ways that seek to inform design. This article attempts to open a discussion around what kinds of fieldwork and subsequent representations emphasize embodiment in the design of tourism technologies-how, in other words, researchers can attend to, and represent, the affective, vital qualities of living with technology and why this might be an increasingly relevant question to ask in the field that has become known as digital tourism. Stressing the inherent openness and contingency of meditation, the article hopes to stir the imaginative registers of scholars and to engender a postdisciplinary dialogue that challenges the field of IT design and information systems research to engage with vulnerable and open discourses in nonrepresentational theory, theories of affect, and place that have been consistently raised in human-or cultural-geography as well as anthropology in the past decades. The article weaves empirical incidents from fieldwork into a postdisciplinary theoretical landscape that spans mobilities, affect, the sensual, and embodiment. Emphasizing learning through the senses and the body and their importance to a sensory apprenticeship, the article suggests alternative routes to knowing and representation in the study of, and ultimately the design for, the digital tourist. © 2016 Cognizant, LLC.","Embodiment; Technologies; Walking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84980315298

This paper presents the changes in the governance of Chinese hospitals initiated in 2009 and shows that these reforms will not solve the current governance problems. The paper explains that, without changing the financial structure of the hospitals, patient involvement in creating reforms (i.e., collaborative innovations) will be unlikely to yield the required improvements. The paper also suggests that patients can nevertheless play an active role in identifying problems.

Both of them are understood in different ways. To discover the boundaries of CSR and innovation, this paper sheds light on the traditional view of CSR, with a focus on its (CSR) integration into the corporate strategy and its linkages to innovation. On the basis of a systematic literature review, a conceptual framework is developed. This framework categorises socio-political stakeholders and identifies other relevant stakeholders on the basis of a theoretical typology. Finally, dialogue strategies are examined regarding their fit within the corporate innovation process. In this regard, stakeholder collaboration is suggested as the appropriate strategy of engaging strategically significant stakeholders. The paper concludes with implications, limitations and further research suggestions.

However, less is known about the processes and the outcomes of the partnerships as well as interactions between partnerships. This paper aims to improve the understanding of how partnerships contribute to developing cleaner technologies in the Danish shipping industry. Two partnerships have been analysed: Partnership for Cleaner Shipping and the Green Ship of the Future. Participation, scope and division of roles among partners have influenced both partnerships. Furthermore, both partnerships have developed organisational forms that proved to overcome the tensions in traditional partnerships, between open and information-based networking on the one side and closed and development-oriented collaboration on the other side.

It uses a mixed methods study of processes of moving businesses within the Danish water sector from a general trust-breakdown to trust recovery from 2003 to 2013. Trust recovery is found to depend on stakeholders' mutual engagement with each other and their willingness to share knowledge and learn from each other's professional and institutional cultures and languages. An alignment of vocabularies of motives between regulation and voluntary CSR is found to be useful for building trust between conflicting parties. Furthermore the findings shows that the more stakeholders' languages, motives and logics can coexist, the more trust can be recovered. The research is limited by a study of one business sector in one country and the findings have implications greater than the local contexts of which it is researched, because it is usable in other sectors that suffer from severe trust-breakdowns such as government systems in both the public and private sectors. This chapter suggests a theoretical extension of Bogenschneider and Corbett's (2010) Community Dissonance Theory to embrace multiple stakeholders each having their own complex and unique culture and communication modus based on their institutional, professional or individual comprehensive language universes. This includes knowledge-sharing and educative diffusion of the stakeholders' language universes' vocabularies including its important nouns, verbs, terminologies, semantics, taxonomies and axioms as well as the stakeholders' motives and logics implemented into these universes.

It takes the form of a literature review, which reveals that the role of arts in terms of governance of cultural sustainability includes the arts as issues of cultural heritage; symbolic translations of cultural values; transferring learning about emotions and life-quality, cooperation and linguistic-logical skills and potential transmitters of socio-economic enhancement of individuals performing it. The negative outcome is that the arts are predominated by the elite and wealthy, and that the potential of the role of the arts in the public education curriculum has not been utilised nor preferred in many countries as a result of low government expenditure. Other projects may exist in non-academic public media that may confirm or reject the findings. The chapter suggests academia and practitioners study, impact and initiate better ways of including the arts in the governance of cultural sustainability through public education. The inclusion of the arts in public education can improve the livelihood of children in all socio-economic areas. It connects two different literatures - that of cultural sustainability and that of traditional art studies in education, and raises questions about current governance practices underestimating the value of including cultural sustainability in governance and the role of the arts herein.

We examined a number of research questions, which were identified from the literature that may influence the internationalisation of family-owned businesses. These questions included: 1) locational liabilities; 2) degree of familiness exhibited by family-owned firms; 3) firm characteristics and nature of their products; 4) growth motive and access to information about foreign markets. Our findings suggest that internationalisation of family-owned firms is a function of its location, availability of infrastructure, family connection, and access to information about foreign markets. Although the owner of the most internationalised firm in the study was willing to give up short-term profits during the start-up period on international expansion, most of the companies in the study were unwilling to give up their short-term profitability. In addition, the more internationalised firms produce more of standardised products than customised ones; the technology contents of their products do not seem to be a determining factor in their internationalisation.

Design/methodology/approach: This study involves experts from food processing companies to elucidate the contextual relationships among the risk drivers and between risk drivers and performance measures. This is used to quantify the relationships and to determine the indirect and overall relationships applying Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modeling. Findings: Three categories of risk drivers which Indian food processing companies need to pay maximum attention to minimize risks are identified. These are supplier dependency and contracting, supplier variability, visibility and traceability and manufacturing disruptions. Analysis shows that collaborating with suppliers and logistics service providers, developing mutually beneficial contracts with them while ensuring that adequate technology investments are made can significantly mitigate risks and consequently improve margins and lead to revenue growth. Research limitations/implications: This study has been carried out with experts from large food processing companies in India, and hence, the results cannot be generalized across other types of food processing companies. Practical implications: The proposed methodology can help understand the interrelationships between supply chain risks and between those risks and performance measures. Thus, it can help a food processing company to create business cases for specific supply chain risk mitigation projects. Originality/value: This study is one of the earliest to create a comprehensive risk propagation map for food processing companies which helps in quantifying the impact the risk drivers have on each other and on performance measures. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Food processing; Fuzzy interpretive structural modeling; Performance impact; Risk propagation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977632770

The data show that even high resource intensive BBGMs can be implemented effectively if there are benefits for a powerful supplier. Cultural influences and uncertainty of the business environment also play a role. Originality/value: This study develops a series of propositions indicating that Agency Theory can provide valuable guidance on how to better understand the effectiveness of BBGMs. Underlying mechanisms are identified that explain how power imbalance does not necessarily make improvement initiatives unsuccessful. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agents; Supplier management; Theories",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977524605

This is illustrated by the demand for evidence-based practice in health care. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a case study in a public post-natal ward in a hospital in Denmark in which one of the authors acted as both a consultant initiating and leading interventions and a researcher using ethnographic methods. The guiding question was: How to incorporate the dynamics of the workplace when doing intervention in professionals’ work and learning? Findings: The findings of the paper show how workplace interventions consist of heterogeneous alliances between politics, discourse and technologies rather than something that can be traced back to a single plan or agency. Furthermore, the paper proposes, a road down the middle, made up by both an intentional and a performative model for intervention. Originality/value: Intervention in workplaces is often directed towards changing humans, their behaviour, their ways of communicating and their attitudes. This is often furthered through reflection, making the success of intervention depend on individuals’ abilities to learn and change. In this paper, it is shown how intervention may benefit from bringing in workplace issues like different professional knowledge regimes, hierarchical structures, materiality, politics and power. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case study; Intention; Intervention; Performance; Professional’s knowledge; Public health care",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977514230

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts a conceptual approach. Hudson’s diagnosis of the current patterns of production is applied to the two dominant streams of theorising on entrepreneurship: the opportunistic discovery view and the resourcefulness view of, for example, effectuation. Findings: The analysis indicates that the opportunistic discovery view and, to some extent, the resourcefulness view are both inadequate as conceptual platforms for entrepreneurial responses to the economic, environmental and socio-spatial crisis. Instead, an alternative perspective on entrepreneurship is developed: Entrepreneurship as re-sourcing. The perspective emphasises the importance of building regional-level resilience through entrepreneurial activity that sources resources from new places and uses these resources to create multiple forms of value. Practical implications: The paper draws attention to dysfunctions in the current theorising on entrepreneurship in light of the economic, environmental and socio-spatial crisis. Instead, the authors offer an alternative. In doing so, the paper also points to the difficult trade-offs that exist between, for example, long-term resilience and short-term competitiveness and growth on a regional, as well as firm level. Originality/value: This paper adds to research by offering an alternative view of entrepreneurship grounded – not in economics – but in economic geography, thus highlighting the importance of productions’ grounding in material reality and the importance of addressing non-economic concerns in our way of thinking about entrepreneurship. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Discovery view; Economic crisis; Entrepreneurship; Environmental crisis; Resilience; Resourcefulness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977472500

However, research in software ecosystems, although the activity of over 10 years, is still characterized as premature with significant lack of software ecosystem specific theories that are solid, mature, generic, and detailed enough to be measurable and transferable. In this study, we intent to come closer to an evolution of the field by supporting the ""localization"" of research, i.e. the focus on specific types of software ecosystems. To do so, we investigate the literature of empirical, non open source ecosystem studies and intent to identify the various aspects and perspectives studied. In total, we review 56 empirical studies that investigate 55 software ecosystems. Our analysis confirms the assumption that proprietary software ecosystem studies lack deeper investigation of technical and collaborative aspects. Moreover, we identify an increased focus on organizational aspects and a rather limited focus on business. Furthermore, we identify common technology as the component investigated most in the ecosystems, both from the technical aspects, but also as means of applying orchestration. Finally, comparing the main areas with the overall ecosystem literature, we identify that empirical studies lack representation of health, motivation, actor activity, reusability, integration, and quality of ecosystems. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Empirical study review; Literature review; Proprietary software ecosystems; Software ecosystems","Ecology; Open source software; Reusability; Software design; Empirical literature; Empirical studies; Literature reviews; Open sources; Organizational aspects; Proprietary software; Software ecosystems; Technical aspects; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84976646469

Building on the concept of governance developed by the global value chain literature, the article identifies two different types of networks: European lead firms internalise core technology components and keep strong captive or relational ties with key component suppliers, whereas Chinese lead firms modularise and externalise core technology components, hence adopting a more flexible approach to technology management. The latter model mirrors a strategy of overcoming technological barriers by tapping into knowledge through global innovation networks.

However, standardization has proven hard to achieve in the socio-technical e-Customs solution.

Amylose, which amount for 20-30%, is the principal linear component, but a fraction is in fact slightly branched. Amylopectin is typically the major component and is extensively branched, containing short chains with an average length of 22-25 glucosyl residues. The branching pattern is not well known, but branch point clustering guides chains to determine the overall starch granule architecture and starch functionality. The clusters consist of 5-10 grouped short chains, which are interconnected by long chains with more than 36 residues. The clusters consist of still smaller, very tightly branched building blocks. The clusters direct the semicrystalline structures found inside the starch granules. The crystals, which are ~5.2 nm thick, contain double helices formed from the external chains extending from the clusters. A range of enzymes is involved in the biosynthesis of the cluster structures and linear segments. These are required for sugar activation, chain elongation, branching, and trimming of the final branching pattern. As an interesting feature, potato amylopectin is substituted with low amounts of phosphate groups monoesterified to the C-3 and the C-6 carbons of the glucose units. They seem to align well in the granular structure and have tremendous effects on starch degradation in the potato and functionality of the refined starch. A specific dikinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of amylopectin. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Amylopectin structure; Amylose structure; Potato starch; Starch granules; Starch phosphorylation; Starch synthesis",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967235563

Up to now,there exists no comprehensive account of what we label the 'technologies of accountability', the effects of their interaction, or the question of how the current turn to decision-making software and biometrics as both the means and ends of accountability may contribute to reshaping humanitarian governance. UNHCR and the Struggle for Accountability explores the UNHCR's quest for accountability by viewing the UNHCR's accountability obligations through the web of institutional relationships within which the agency is placed (beneficiaries, host governments, implementing partners, donors, the Executive Committee and UNGA). The book takes a multidisciplinary approach in order to illuminate the various layers and relationships that constitute accountability and also to reflect on what constitutes good enough accountability. This book contributes to the discussion regarding how we construct knowledge about concepts in humanitarian studies and is a valuable resource for academics, researchers and professionals in the areas of anthropology, history, international relations, international law, science, technology studies and socio-legal studies. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Kristin Bergtora Sandvik and Katja Lindskov Jacobsen.

They may utilise their dual embeddedness in both the home country and the host country, and also use transnational links to gain a competitive advantage in exporting compared to indigenous entrepreneurs. Migrant entrepreneurs' advantage may, however, be contingent on attributes such as gender and education, especially among the first generation of migrants, in that being male and educated is more advantageous for migrants than for indigenous entrepreneurs. A representative sample of 50,371 entrepreneurs establishing or operating enterprises around the world was surveyed in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, which reports on migration and exporting. Hierarchical linear modelling shows that migrant entrepreneurs export more than indigenous entrepreneurs, especially in the first generation, and especially among educated and male migrants. These findings can be generalised to migrant and indigenous entrepreneurs worldwide to enhance knowledge about the entrepreneurial benefits of migration, albeit contingent on gender and education.

We hypothesise that exporting is constrained by networking in the private sphere, but promoted by networking in the public sphere, and benefitting especially from networking in the transnational environment. This dynamic unfolds in the context of culture, which expectedly moderates benefit of networks for exporting. Networking for advice was surveyed in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor in 61 societies with 52,968 entrepreneurs. Exporting greatly benefits from transnational networks around entrepreneurs and also from networking in the market, professions and work-place, but is impeded by networking for advice in the private sphere. Exporting is embedded in culture in the way that benefits of transnational networking for exporting are higher in secular-rational culture than in traditional culture.

Unexpectedly, we did not find a direct moderation effect of occupational self-efficacy.

Food marketing and retailing contribute to consumer-related food waste via decisions on date labeling, packaging sizes and design elements, and pricing strategies encouraging overpurchase, as well as communication shifting consumer priorities to the disadvantage of food waste avoidance. Potential actions to tackle food waste relate to improved packaging and information, altering pricing strategies, and cooperation with other actors across the supply chain. Three cases highlight the extent to which moral and strategic motives are interlinked and that there are opportunities for competitive advantage through corporate social responsibility and a business case for sustainability in the area of food waste. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Consumer; CSR; food waste; retail; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963799364

Using the case of a sudden and unanticipated currency devaluation in Botswana as a quasi-experiment, we examine how this monetary shock affects individuals' evaluations of well-being. We do so by using microlevel survey data, which-incidentally-were collected in the days surrounding the devaluation. The chance occurrence of the devaluation during the time of the survey enables us to use pretreatment respondents, surveyed before the devaluation, as approximate counterfactuals for post-treatment respondents, surveyed after the devaluation. Our estimates show that the devaluation had a large and significantly negative effect on individuals' evaluations of subjective well-being. These results suggest that macroeconomic shocks, such as unanticipated currency devaluations, may have significant short-term costs in the form of reductions in people's sense of well-being. © The Author 2014.

A growing number of countries and organizations are putting great effort into integrating innovation in school curricula, as well as in staff and manager training programmes. Innovation strategies and government-sponsored documents throughout the world have stressed the need to accelerate innovation. Innovation is no longer reserved for research and development departments or so-called creative professions. It has become a key goal towards which on-going professional development needs to be directed. Now perceived as germane and even necessary in almost all kinds of work, the innovation potential in everyday practices and ways of allowing for employer creativity have become highly relevant objects of study. However, there is a need to know what professionals actually do in the process of experimenting in and through their work, as well as the managerial priorities from which experiments and adjustments can be supported to become innovations. Traditionally, research has regarded innovation in terms of phases of invention, implementation and dissemination. These phase models, despite often being described as messy and iterative may, however, be inadequate for investigating and supporting innovation as an integrated part of ongoing professional development. A case study of everyday innovation efforts in elderly care in Denmark is used here to propose an alternative model. The model suggests that innovation can be studied and supported by means of three driving forces, termed (i) craft (i.e. professional skills and knowledge), (ii) levers (i.e. experiments and adjustment of routines) and (iii) purposes (i.e. values and visions). The model points to the necessary interrelations between professionals’ ongoing development and their engagement in innovative practices and thus provides a conception of welfare innovation which is not translated from firm innovation, but derived directly from welfare contexts. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Creative Action; Elderly Care; Innovation Policy; Innovation Strategy; Ongoing Development",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962173924

In the case study of an energy renovation project of hotel facilities, we analyse the journey from having the intention to implement extensive energy renovation measures to actually implementing a solution.

In this method, named entities are detected, disambiguated and aggregated into clusters, which in turn inform cloud construction. We show that word clouds using named entity clusters attain broader coverage and decreased content duplication. Further, an extrinsic evaluation shows improved access to data, with word clouds having grouped named entities being rated more relevant and diverse.

A largescale incentivized experiment with subjects randomly drawn from the Danish population is conducted. We find that deciding for others reduces loss aversion. When choosing between risky prospects for which losses are ruled out by design, subjects make the same choices for themselves as for others. In contrast, when losses are possible, we find that the two types of choices differ. In particular, we find that subjects who make choices for themselves take less risk than those who decide for others when losses loom. This finding is consistent with an interpretation of loss aversion as a bias in decision making driven by emotions and that these emotions are reduced when making decisions for others. © Copyright 2016, INFORMS.","Experiment; Loss aversion; Risk taking","Experiments; Risk management; Loss aversion; Making decision; Risk taking; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961350837

First aid is provided by community first responders who use their smartphone. FirstAED global positioning system (GPS)-tracks the nine nearby first responders and enables the emergency dispatcher to send an organised team of three first responders with distinct roles to the scene automatically. During the first 24 months the FirstAED system was used 718 times. Three first responders arrived in ∼89% of the cases, and they arrived before the ambulance in ∼94% of the cases.

The question is; how do capacity building projects affect African universities, researchers and students? Universities and their scientific knowledges are often seen to have universal qualities; therefore, capacity building may appear straight forward. Higher Education and Capacity Building in Africa contests such universalistic notions. Inspired by ideas about the ‘geography of scientific knowledge’ it explores what role specific places and relationships have in knowledge production, and analyses how cultural experiences are included and excluded in teaching and research. Thus, the different chapters show how what constitutes legitimate scientific knowledge is negotiated and contested. In doing so, the chapters draw on discussions about the hegemony of Western thought in education and knowledge production. The authors’ own experiences with higher education capacity building and knowledge production are discussed and used to contribute to the reflexive turn and rise of auto-ethnography. This book is a valuable resource for researchers and postgraduate students in education, development studies, African studies and human geography, as well as anthropology and history. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Hanne Kirstine Adriansen, Lene Møller Madsen and Stig Jensen; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960498748

Further, theorists propose that firms led by paradoxical thinkers are more likely to manage these tensions and fuel innovative behavior. Leveraging family business and organizational paradox literatures, this multi-stage exploratory study develops measures of paradoxical tensions and paradoxical thinking in family firms, and tests these propositions. Findings indicate that paradoxical tensions may stymie innovative behavior, but that leaders' paradoxical thinking is positively related to innovative behavior. © 2016 Baylor University.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960401266

In this article, we propose that network effects differ between collectivistic and individualistic contexts. In a collectivistic context, resource sharing will be ""value based."" It is expected that members of a group support each other and share resources. In contrast, in an individualistic context, resource sharing will be more often based on reciprocity and trust. Hence, we hypothesized that networks will be more beneficial in individual contexts compared with collectivistic context.

Its infrastructure is being upgraded rapidly. The supply, demand and prices are becoming more volatile and less predictable than ever before. Even its business model is being challenged fundamentally. In this competitive and dynamic environment, many decision-making processes rely on probabilistic forecasts to quantify the uncertain future. Although most of the papers in the energy forecasting literature focus on point or single-valued forecasts, the research interest in probabilistic energy forecasting research has taken off rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we summarize the recent research progress on probabilistic energy forecasting. A major portion of the paper is devoted to introducing the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 (GEFCom2014), a probabilistic energy forecasting competition with four tracks on load, price, wind and solar forecasting, which attracted 581 participants from 61 countries.

Using an original historical database of energy accidents over the period 1950-2014, it comparatively assesses energy accident risk across biofuels, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectricity, hydrogen, nuclear power, solar energy, and wind energy. Our study shows how these energy systems collectively involved 686 accidents resulting in 182,794 human fatalities and $265.1 billion in property damages. Across the entire sample, the mean amount of property damage was $388.8 million and 267.2 fatalities per accident, though when reflected as a median the numbers substantially improve to $820,000 in damages per accident and zero fatalities. Wind energy is the most frequent to incur an accident within our sample (48.8 percent of accidents), hydroelectric accidents tend to be the most fatal (97.2 percent of all deaths), and nuclear energy accidents tend to be the most expensive (accounting for 90.8 percent of damages). The article uses this data to present a set of unique risk profiles: nuclear, hydro, and wind energy are categorized as having a ""high"" risk of accidents; hydrogen, biofuels, and biomass ""moderate"" a accident risk; solar and geothermal a ""low"" risk. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Customers as sources of innovation have been analysed previously in the literature, whereas the process of how complaining users mobilise support to influence companies has received less attention and is not well understood. This study uncovers the processes that made it possible for a 17-year-old Norwegian to become pivotal in constructing a problematisation, which emerged to become so strong as to alter the Norwegian Coca-Cola Company's earlier decision to cease production of a product in a certain size. The analysis uses constructs from actor-network theory (ANT) and shows how a single dissatisfied individual was able to become a spokesperson who, through different processes, mobilised a heterogeneous group of consumers into a loosely connected hybrid collective. The spokesperson acted on behalf of the hybrid collective and put growing pressure on a multinational company, influencing its decision making. In this case, the complaining customer did not exit, nor did he become a lead user, but rather became a hybrid customer who actively tried to mobile others in his desire for a product. The study reports on a process analysis of the means by which the company was induced to reinstate a discontinued product.

This paper contributes to the growing number of historical accounts in the IS field by further developing the profile of European IS research that was reported on in EJIS following the first 10 years of the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS). On the basis of an analysis of all papers published in ECIS proceedings during the 10-year period 2003-2012, the paper highlights three key characteristics of the developing European IS research profile: (1) continuation of the traditional European IS research profile as developed in the first decade; (2) convergence with aspects of the North American tradition and (3) development of a distinct approach to design science. We place these observed characteristics within broader historical and contextual features such as the changing European academic landscape, with increasing pressures to 'publish or perish' in order to be internationally competitive. Our contribution lies in providing a contemporaneous account of the dominant contextual factors influencing the European IS academy in recent years as well as our interpretation of the developing research profile, thus informing future understanding of European IS research and the choices facing individual IS researchers. © 2016 Operational Research Society Ltd.","European Conference on Information Systems; European information systems research; history; research methods; research topics","History; Information systems; Contextual factors; Contextual feature; Design science; Historical account; Key characteristics; Publish or perish; Research approach; Research topics; Information use",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959522821

This study mitigates the current pervasive scarcity of data on process efficiency and costs by documenting typical steps taken in a techno-economic assessment of MRFs, using the specific example of lightweight packaging waste (LWP) sorting in Germany. Thus, the study followed the steps of dimensioning of buildings and equipment, calculation of processing costs and projections of revenues from material sales and sorting residues disposal costs. Material flows through the plants were simulated considering both optimal process conditions and real or typical conditions characterised by downtime and frequent operation at overcapacity. By modelling four plants of progressively higher capacity (size) and technological level, the analysis revealed the cost impact of economies of scale, as well as complementary relations linking capacity, technology and process efficiency. Hence, within a fourfold increase in capacity (from 25,000 to 100,000 tonnes per year), the total capital investment was shown to triple from 7 to 21 million EUR and the yearly operational expenditure grew by a factor of 2.4 from 2 to 4.7 million EUR. As a result, specific unit processing cost decreased from 110 to 70 EUR/tonne. Material sales and disposal costs summed to between a net cost of 25 EUR/tonne and net revenue of 50 EUR/tonne. Measured as total materials recovery, the difference between optimal and typical operation was approximately 15% points. The complex nature of LWP waste combined with challenging processing conditions were identified as important factors explaining the relatively low overall recovery efficiencies achieved in these plants. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, we still miss an in-depth study of their potential and challenges during the innovation process in firms. This is a serious omission as many international firms are in need of improving their global innovation position by the inclusion of insights from team members of different nationalities with knowledge about markets and culture. To derive first insights, we conducted a longitudinal qualitative study in a large global company with 70 personal interviews in five innovation teams over a period of two years. These data, based on semi-structured interviews, provide us with rich information about effects of cultural diversity in teams in the innovation process. Data were analysed through a thematic network analysis and two coders inductively forming categories. Results indicate that cross-cultural teams have a high potential of creativity, but are confronted with difficulties arising from different working- and communication styles which have to be proactively managed from the beginning. While progressing, teams learn to cope with this diversity related to some more surface-level cultural dimensions and members even align. Yet, diversity of power distance induces conflicts that deeply impact the innovation process. Based on these findings, we develop a set of propositions, which lead into a conceptual model on the effects of multi-cultural team work on creativity and innovation. Finally, we discuss further implications for research and practice. © 2016 Imperial College Press.","Creativity; Cultural diversity; Innovation; Multi-cultural; Team performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959489100

A number of terms such as synthetic fuel and electrofuel are used to describe both renewable and alternative fuels. The aim of this article is to identify and review these terms to avoid any potential misuse. An integrative review of terminology has been made. This review did not differentiate the articles in terms of the methodologies applied, but had the main objective to identify the terminology used and its definition. The results confirm that the term synthetic fuel is used generically in the majority of articles, without providing information about the production process of the fuel or differentiating between fossil-based and renewable-based synthetic fuels. The majority of the articles use the term synthetic fuel to describe fuels produced with coal-, gas- and biomass-to-liquid (xTL) technologies. However, a number of articles use the term beyond this definition. Results for the term electrofuel gave a similar outcome, as it was not clear which processes were used for the fuel production. In some cases, both synthetic and electrofuel referred to fuels produced through the same process, even though in reality the two processes are distinctly different. This could lead to a misinterpretation, especially if the terminology is utilized by policymakers. To prevent this, the article ends with a preliminary proposal for how to differentiate synthetic fuels from electrofuels based on the production process. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Entrepreneurship policy has long been investigated; however, the organizational aspects of policy delivery efforts seem to have gone unnoticed. Adaptability and collaboration are two organizational factors that are central to the configuration of local entrepreneurship support systems. However, as hypothesized in this paper, the level of collaboration and adaptability depends on the entrepreneurship orientation of the local government. In contingency theory, strategy is a determinant of organizational structure, and the entrepreneurship orientation of governments is such a strategy. Based on a survey of 86 (out of 98) municipalities in Denmark, the paper concludes that the more positively oriented the local government is towards entrepreneurship in its policy making, the better the adaptability and collaboration in the entrepreneurship support system.","Denmark; Entrepreneurship orientation; Entrepreneurship policy; Organization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959454814

The application of lean principles during the final stage of a new product development process, that is, the ramp-up process, is a critical, early enabler of lean manufacturing. The manufacturing strategy literature conceptualizes a state of ""leanness in operations,"" which can consolidate both the concepts of lean and manufacturing ramp-up, providing a dual perspective. Abstracting from the extant literature, the authors considered the competitiveness of manufacturing companies from two principal perspectives: the leanness of the ramp-up process and the new-value creation of quality managers. While much of the literature fails to acknowledge that the roots of lean actually lie in quality evolution and TQM, there is relatively sparse evidence on the subject of applying the lean philosophy to manufacturing ramp-up, so this study is an attempt to address this gap. This is achieved by providing a comprehensive outline of the two concepts and illustrating the areas in which mutual benefits can be drawn, as well as providing a conceptual framework for future studies in lean application to the manufacturing ramp-up process. © 2016, ASQ.","Conceptual framework; Lean; Manufacturing ramp-up",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958168419

This is stressed in political and accreditation frameworks all over the world, and universities are trying to respond to this demand. However, in many cases, sustainability practices seem fragmented and there is a lack of knowledge of strategies and few clear examples of good practice. In this paper, activities to integrate sustainability in two engineering institutions, one in Denmark and one in Australia, are systematically compared to provide an understanding of different kinds of activities and their internal as well as external enablers. A conceptual framework to provide overview of education for sustainability activities and their enablers has been proposed, where activities are related to actors and resources at both university and national levels. The conceptual framework has been developed iteratively - moving back and forth trying to find a suitable structure to capture the contextual pillars of the activities in the two cases, using state-of-art within the research field of education for sustainable development to fill out potential blind spots in the case-material and, finally, continuously shaping the storylines in the two cases to provide the needed overview and understanding of the similarities and differences of the approaches. The interplay between the framework and the case-stories provides a platform for change, as the framework does not only create an overview of activities, it also points out potential routes not taken, and the case studies provide examples of activities, which can be transferred with careful consideration to the internal as well as external context. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A complete LCA was applied to non-loadbearing external climate walls for comparative purposes. The LCIA phase of the case study was performed using five different Impact Assessment Methods: EDIP 97/2003 (midpoint), CML 2001 (midpoint), Impact 2002+ (endpoint and midpoint), ReCiPe (endpoint and midpoint) and the ILCD recommended practices for LCIA (midpoint). The endpoint results were compared aggregately, and the midpoint categories concerning similar potential impacts were compared individually for the analysis of possible deviations. The observations and comparisons involved mostly the decision maker's point of view and not the differences among the characterization models. The endpoint LCIA showed that the only two methods which applied such an approach (Impact 2002+ and ReCiPe) provided different results and led to different conclusions. For midpoint LCIA, the results were completely consistent for the following impact categories: General Eutrophication, Aquatic and Freshwater Ecotoxicity, Ionizing Radiation, Particulate Matter Formation, and Resources Depletion. Global Warming, Terrestrial Ecotoxicity, Human Toxicity (except for the Non-carcinogens impact category) and Land Use (except for Natural Land Transformation) showed partially consistent results and pointed out to the same worst environmental alternative, but with a slightly different impact profile among the other alternatives.

This concern, among others, lies behind growing research in the field of so-called resource criticality. This study is a review of existing resource criticality assessment methodologies. It characterizes and analyses existing methods and identifies aspects of concern for the ability of assessment methods to provide proper guidance for strategy making in the field of energy system development. The validity of the identified concerns is, further, demonstrated by applying a case study of resource criticality assessment of the direct-drive wind turbines technology. Two key concerns are identified. The first is the need for a dynamic perspective on the supply risk dimension. This study reveals that the geological reserve estimates and geographical location of supply change significantly over time, implying that the static supply risk assessment provided by many methods gives misleading guidance. The second concern is the ability of methods to properly account for the vulnerability of the studied system to a supply disruption of the resource in question. Through the case study, the options for resource substitution are elaborated for wind turbines by applying a holistic design approach looking at all levels of design substitutions from the level of materials and components to subassemblies and whole-product concepts. This approach reveals that the dependence of substances like neodymium and dysprosium is not strong, and that they are not essential to the wider implementation of direct-drive wind turbines in general. This technology specific and product design based approach is new, and questions the ability of existing methods to properly address the impact that the risk of supply disruption of a given resource really has on the technological and economic development of a system or technology under study. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The investigation is based on a mixed-method approach combining questionnaire and interview data. The implementation of design principles resulted in a variety of exhibits which variously prompted reflection and discussion on the part of visitors. Exhibits with narratives, for example, here defined as both personal and expert narratives, were found to be effective in facilitating personal reflection but also prompted discussion. Participation, defined as including both physical interaction with exhibits, and dialogic interaction between visitors, facilitated the sharing of ideas and feelings between visitors. Exhibits with elements of curiosity and challenge were found to attract pupils’ attention but also worked well with other design principles to engage the pupils in sustained reflection and discussion. While other contextual factors remain significant in determining visitor responses, this paper argues that the use of design principles can help create visitor experiences that correspond to exhibition aims. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","curiosity; design principles; exhibit design; issues-based exhibitions; narratives; participation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955494424

In addition to the drivers of and barriers to the adoption of CSR initiatives, this study highlights key lessons learned from empirical studies of CSR initiatives that aimed to improve environmental management and work conditions and reduce poverty in local industrial districts. Academic work in this area remains embryonic, lacking in empirical evidence about the effects of CSR interventions on the profitability on local enterprises, workers, and the environment. Nor do theoretical frameworks offer clear explanations of the institutionalization and effects of CSR in local industrial districts in the developing world. Other key limitations in this research stream include an excessive focus on export-oriented industrial clusters, the risk that CSR becomes a form of economic and cultural imperialism, and the potential for joint-action CSR initiatives in clusters of small and medium-sized enterprises to offer a new form of greenwashing. From this review, the authors develop a theoretical model to explain why CSR has not become institutionalized in many developing country clusters, which in turn suggests that the vast majority of industrial clusters in developing countries are likely to engage in socially irresponsible behavior. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Developing countries; Industrial clusters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955215336

Hobbes offers the myth of the uncivilized human in the dystopian state of nature who needs governance in order to counter his or her own self-destructive tendencies.

Rousseau proposes a counter-myth that envisions the noble savage in the utopian state of nature, who becomes morally corrupted by being socialized into the institutions of modern society. This myth is echoed in post-bureaucratic management literature. Comparing Rousseau's romanticization of nature with what I call the romanticization of markets, I show how the post-bureaucratic management literature employs the logic of market rationalism to generate a managerial pedagogy that installs the market as the control mechanism for regulating the internal relations of the organization. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Hobbes; market rationalism; mythology; post-bureaucracy; Rousseau",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955185906

This involves the selection of an appropriate speed by the vessel, so as to optimize a certain objective. As ship speed is not fixed, depressed shipping markets and/or high fuel prices induce slow steaming which is being practised in many sectors of the shipping industry. In recent years the environmental dimension of slow steaming has also become important, as ship emissions are directly proportional to fuel burned. Win-win solutions are sought, but they will not necessarily be possible. The chapter presents some basics, discusses the main trade-offs and also examines combined speed and route optimization problems.

SOx emissions are non-GHG emissions that are caused by the presence of sulphur in the fuel. As the maximum percentage of sulphur in automotive and aviation fuels is strictly regulated in most countries around the world, much of the attention in recent years has focused on maritime transport. The attention mainly stems from the fact that in marine fuels the percentage of sulphur can be very high: it can be as high as 4.5% in Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), which is the fuel typically used in all deep-sea trades. Even though the amounts of SOx produced by ships are substantially lower than CO2, SOx emissions are highly undesirable as they cause acid rain and undesirable health effects in humans and animals. To mitigate these adverse environmental effects, the international shipping community has taken substantial policy measures. With the introduction of new limits for the content of sulphur in marine fuels in Northern European and North American sea areas, short-sea companies operating in these areas will face substantial additional cost. As of 1/1/2015, international regulations stipulate, among other things, a 0.1%limit in the sulphur content of marine fuels, or equivalent measures limiting the percent of SOx emissions to the same amount. As low-sulphur fuel is substantially more expensive than HFO, there is little or no room within these companies current margins to absorb such additional cost, and thus significant price increases must be expected. Unlike its deep-sea counterpart, in short-sea shipping such a freight rate increase may induce shippers to use landbased alternatives (mainly road). A reverse shift of cargo would go against the EU policy to shift traffic from land to sea to reduce congestion, and might ultimately (under certain circumstances) increase the overall level of CO2 emissions along the entire supply chain. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the potential effect of sulphur regulations on the share of cargo transported by the waterborne mode vis-à-vis land-based alternatives. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954524073

The governance scheme of the recently introduced TEN-T core network corridors seems to fulfil this requirement. Following a brief history of TEN-T development, the 2013 major overhaul of the EU transportation infrastructure policy is outlined and the basic differences with the past are pinpointed. The provisions of the new TEN-T Guidelines are scrutinized so as to check whether the TEN-T core network corridors exhibit the characteristics of a green corridor, as they have been identified in the previous chapter. Based on the results of this analysis, it is concluded that the TEN-T core network is, as far as its freight dimension is concerned, a network of green corridors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954502454

Air pollution from transportation and especially carbon dioxide emissions are at the center stage of discussion by the world community through various international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol. The transportation sector also emits non-CO2 pollutants that have important effects on air quality, climate, and public health. The main purpose of this chapter is to introduce some basic concepts that are relevant in the quest of green transportation logistics. First, we present the basics of estimating emissions from transportation activities, the current statistics and future trends, as well as the total impact of air emissions and its contribution to climate change. In addition, this chapter presents the basics of environmental policy measures. In that context, we describe a way to measure the cost-effectiveness of various measures through the so-called Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC). Finally, the chapter deals with the topic of the energy efficiency gap and examines why governments and companies may forego costeffective investments in energy efficiency, even though they could significantly reduce energy consumption at a lower cost. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954468852

Drawing on theory on executive succession, it is argued that corporate capacity is likely to increase following succession as new executives need early support to succeed in the job. The effect of succession is expected to decrease over time as the new executive settles in. These effects are expected to be most pronounced following outside successions. My expectations are tested in a longitudinal study of executive succession and corporate capacity in Danish municipalities 1993-2000. The findings largely support the theory put forward and suggest that corporate capacity is unaffected by inside succession and increased following outside succession.

Theoretically, we combine existing arguments in public administration with institutional theory and the sociology of professions. Empirically, we ask whether different measures of individual performance produce different results. The investigated performance measures vary with regard to risk of common data source bias, standardization of assessment criteria, and external verification of the assessment. Our investigated explanatory variables are intrinsic motivation, public service motivation, and job satisfaction. Combining survey and administrative data for 747 lower secondary school teachers (teaching 5,679 students in 85 schools), we analyze 4 different measures of the same performance dimension for the same teachers: the teachers' self-reported contributions to students' academic skills, the students' marks for the year's work given by the teacher, marks in oral exams with one external examiner and the teacher, and marks in written exams with at least one external examiner. The associations are systematically stronger when the performance measure comes from the same data source as the explanatory variables, but when separate data sources are used and the measurement scale is institutionalized, the level of external verification does not matter much. Based on institutional theory and the sociology of professions, we develop a theoretical argument that can explain this. © 2015 The Author.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954324060

We argue that three interrelated characteristics of global cities - cosmopolitanism, availability of advanced producer services, and interconnectedness - help MNEs to overcome the liability of foreignness. We operationalise liability of foreignness as institutional distance and analyse its influence on the worldwide location of a large sample of subsidiaries of Nordic and Japanese MNEs. Our results indicate that MNEs have a stronger propensity to locate in global cities than in metropolitan or peripheral areas, and that these locational choices are affected by institutional distance and industrial characteristics. The results provide empirical support for our argument that locating in a global city can reduce the liability of foreignness suffered by MNEs, and that global cities play a central role in the process of globalisation.

However, ideas of performance are traditionally contested in the health care sector and split up between a professional and a bureaucratic understanding of effective service delivery. With the rise of New Public Management, an additional layer of PM instruments has been put on the already existing structures. As a result, different PM regimes can be distinguished, which vary in the way they define performance, blame underperformance and design accountability instruments to ensure appropriate behaviour.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the factors that project managers experience as having the greatest effect on time, cost, and quality, and to discover whether the effects of these factors are significantly different from each other. A questionnaire with 26 factors identified from interviews was sent to the full population of publicly employed project managers. Factors were ranked using the relative importance index and tested for significant differences using Friedman's test. Wilcoxon's test was used in a post-hoc analysis. From the findings it was determined that the most influential factor for time is unsettled or lack of project funding; for cost, errors or omissions in consultant material; and for quality, errors or omissions in construction work. The main conclusion of this research is that project schedule, budget, and quality level are affected in significantly different ways. Therefore, a project manager cannot handle such critical issues by focusing only on schedule or budget complications; nor can he or she assume that time, cost, and quality are equally affected. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction management; Cost overrun; Denmark; Quality level; Schedule delay","Budget control; Construction industry; Managers; Project management; Surveys; Construction management; Cost overruns; Denmark; Quality levels; Schedule delay; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950282798

Not only was the eurozone economic crisis undermining both policy effectiveness and public support for the EU, but it was also seriously challenging the EU's image in global politics. The eurozone crisis, the Nobel Prize and the search for a 'new narrative for Europe' demonstrate that the processes of European integration are always narrated as sense-making activities - stories people tell to make sense of their reality. This article argues in favour of a narrative approach to European integration through the construction and application of an analytical framework drawing on different theoretical perspectives. This framework is then applied to six European integration narratives to demonstrate the value of a narrative approach.

Eco-innovation has been generally directed at energy input-substitutes, component recycling, etc. Some companies have made investments reducing resource burdens in the production process. This study investigated options for eco-efficiency improvement in two large manufacturing companies, Volvo and Arla Foods. Their impetus for eco-innovation comes from the companies' environmental policies, as well as from external drivers such as future higher costs and resource scarcity. Relative to their respective industrial sector, these companies represent strong prospects for reducing resource burdens in water-service processes, especially from chemical inputs and wastewater. Such eco-innovations involve more complex interactions beyond the production site, so the options warrant a whole-system comparative assessment. The EcoWater project has analysed the entire water-service value chain through meso-level interactions among heterogeneous actors (process-water users, providers and wastewater treatment companies). The project has developed a methodology to obtain the necessary information, to involve stakeholders in the assessment and to facilitate their discussion on alternative options. Each study stimulated internal company discussions on the need and means to evaluate whole-system effects of investment decisions. Inter-organisational cooperation helped to anticipate how meso-level resource-efficiency relates to lower burdens in wastewater treatment. The assessment method can be extended to any water-service system. By comparing options, the method can facilitate better decisions improving meso-level resource efficiency. As wider implications, some improvement options may complicate 'eco-innovation' as double-eco benefits: win-win for whom, where and what level? © 2015 The Authors.","Arla Foods; Eco-efficiency; Eco-innovation; Meso level (whole system); Value chain; Volvo Trucks","Chains; Environmental protection; Investments; Trucks; Wastewater treatment; Arla foods; Eco-efficiency; Eco-innovation; Mesolevel; Value chains; Volvo Trucks; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949648006

However, contrasting views, arguing that environmental regulations will, in fact, enhance firms' competitiveness by inducing innovation, have also been voiced. Here, this issue is examined through a literature review on the innovation inducement impact of environmental regulations (i.e., the Porter Hypothesis), in general, and the economic impacts of environmental regulations (here Annex VI of the MARPOL Convention) as it applies to shipping in Northern Europe, in particular. According to the review, the literature is still inconclusive and lacks a clear consensus on the economic and innovation inducement impacts of environmental regulations on maritime transport. Therefore, the review concludes in suggestions for further studies on the use of marine scrubber systems as an illustrative case study example.

Other actors are often involved in this creation, and the question is, what they experience and gain from their involvements. Heritage sites offer complex, negotiable products that depend on interaction to fully emerge and form valuable experiences, and they are therefore relevant to explore in this context. Based on theory of the heritage experience, an analysis is undertaken to explore various levels and dynamics of involvement. Co-creation literature addresses the complex processes of co-creation, which indicate that interaction is at the centre of involvement, and this exploratory research therefore zooms in on interaction in re-enactors’ experiences at a heritage site.

By focusing on impulse- and step-indicator saturation, we use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the performance of this approach for detecting additive outliers and level shifts in the analysis of nonstationary seasonal time series. The reference model is the basic structural model, featuring a local linear trend, possibly integrated of order two, stochastic seasonality and a stationary component.

This study analyzes the energy balances and greenhouse gas emissions of 24 different technology scenarios for the production of algal biodiesel from Nannochloropsis cultivated at industrial scale in photobioreactors in Denmark. Both consolidated and pioneering technologies are analyzed focusing on strengths and weaknesses which influence the performance. Based on literature data, energy balance and greenhouse gas emissions are determined in a comparative 'well-to-tank' Life Cycle Assessment against fossil diesel. Use of by-products from biodiesel production such as glycerol obtained from transesterification and anaerobic digestion of residual biomass are included. Different technologies and methods are considered in cultivation stage (freshwater vs. wastewater; synthetic CO2 vs. waste CO2), harvesting stage (flocculation vs. centrifugation) and oil extraction stage (hexane extraction vs. supercritical CO2 extraction). The choices affecting environmental performance of the scenarios are evaluated. Results show that algal biodiesel produced through current conventional technologies has higher energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions than fossil diesel. However, greenhouse gas emissions of algal biodiesel can be significantly reduced through the use of 'waste' flows (nutrients and CO2) but there are still technical difficulties with both microalgae cultivation in wastewater as well as transportation and injection of waste CO2. In any way, a positive energy balance is still far from being achieved. Considerable improvements must be made to develop an environmentally beneficial microalgae biodiesel production on an industrial scale.

But are negative stereotypes of the public sector reflected in people's perceptions of public service provision? Given the methodological challenges of isolating the perception of publicness from other factors related to public organizations, little is known about whether public organizations have a negative image. The authors use a survey experimental design to isolate the effect of publicness on perceptions of the performance of hospitals. The results suggest that public sector organizations have a negative image on productivity-related aspects of performance but not on normative aspects of performance. As this article is a randomized experiment, it provides strong evidence regarding the causal nature of the relationship between publicness and perceptions of performance. Implications for researchers aiming to understand these mechanisms and for public managers concerned about the image of their organization are discussed. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941784146

Valid and reliable data sets on ships' energy consumption are often missing in shipping markets and within shipping organizations, leading to the non-implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency measures. Policy makers are aiming to remedy this, e.g., through the EU Monitoring, Verification and Reporting scheme. In this paper, current practices for energy consumption monitoring in ship operations are explored based on interviews with 55 professionals in 34 shipping organizations in Denmark. Best practices, which require several years to implement, are identified, as are common challenges in implementing such practices - related to data collection, incentives for data misreporting, data analysis problems, as well as feedback and communication problems between ship and shore. This study shows how the logic of good energy consumption monitoring practices conflict with common business practices in shipping companies - e.g., through short-term vessel charters and temporary ship organizations - which in turn can explain the slow adoption of energy efficiency measures in the industry. This study demonstrates a role for policy makers or other third parties in mandating or standardizing good energy consumption monitoring practices beyond the present requirements. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to address this, this study aims at developing a sustainability assessment framework for prioritizing the technologies for groundwater contamination remediation by combining the concept of sustainability and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. A criterion system which consists of six criteria in three aspects has been proposed for sustainability assessment of technologies for groundwater contamination remediation, and a novel MCDM method by combining the logarithmic fuzzy preference programming based fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and the improved ELECTRE method has been developed for prioritizing the alternatives. In order to illustrate the developed methodology, four technologies including pump-treat (P&T), monitored natural attenuation (MNA), permeable reactive barriers (PRB), and air sparging (AS) have been studied, and the results show that the proposed methodology is feasible for prioritizing the technologies for groundwater contamination remediation for the stakeholders/decision-makers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, even objective, clear, and unambiguous performance information is subject to biased interpretation depending on whether the information is consistent with the prior beliefs held by those who receive the information. Integrating the theory of motivated reasoning with the literature on performance information, the authors hypothesize that performance information that is inconsistent with prior beliefs is less likely to be interpreted correctly than belief-consistent information. Using randomized survey experiments in which respondents were presented with quantitative performance data, the authors show that subjects systematically interpret performance information in ways that conform with their prior beliefs. The findings question the assumption that providing performance information automatically increases knowledge about government performance, let alone improves political decisions. © 2016 by The American Society for Public Administration.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931077293

In order to provide reliable wind power forecasts for periods beyond a couple of hours, forecasts of the wind speed are fundamental. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework for wind speed that is based on stochastic differential equations. We show that stochastic differential equations allow us to capture the time dependence structure of wind speed prediction errors naturally (from 1 to 24 h ahead) and, most importantly, to derive point and quantile forecasts, predictive distributions, and time-path trajectories (also referred to as scenarios or ensemble forecasts), all using one single stochastic differential equation model that is characterized by a few parameters. © 2015 International Institute of Forecasters","Probabilistic forecasting; Stochastic differential equations; Wind power; Wind speed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929923153
