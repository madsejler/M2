For example, the field of software ecosystems is influenced by both natural and business ecosystems, as studies have identified a strong inspiration from both. In this study, we survey the ecosystem literature and identify how different types of ecosystems as much as their aspects appear in a wide literature scope. Using a bibliometric approach, our study reveals a literature body of 2,271 documents published from 1990 onward. Our analysis identifies 11 distinct research communities with one of them focusing on software ecosystems. Furthermore, it also reveals that, although the different communities are rather connected with each other, the software ecosystems community appears as an outlier, with little connections to other communities. When examining the software ecosystem community, consisted of 147 publications, we identify four distinct thematic clusters. We characterize these clusters by their theoretical background and uncover lack of a prevailing theoretical theme. Thus, this study calls for a formation of a research agenda for the software ecosystem field. © 2017 IEEE.","bibliometric; research Agenda; Software ecosystem","Engineering; Industrial engineering; Bibliometric; Biological ecosystem; Business ecosystem; Literature reviews; Research agenda; Research communities; Software ecosystems; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050232256

The term 'institutional response capacity' can be defined as a measurement for how effective political institutions may respond to threats and challenges such as climate change. This book sets out to provide a venue for the discussion of how to conduct climate politics by offering new perspectives on how social and political institutions are capable of responding to climate change. In doing so, the book explores how democracy, institutional design and polycentric governance influence social and political entities' capacity to mitigate, adapt, address and transform climate change. The book offers building blocks for a new agenda of climate studies by focusing on institutional response capacity and by offering a new approach to climate governance at a time when many political initiatives have failed. This interdisciplinary volume is a valuable resource for academics, researchers and policy-makers in the areas of anthropology, political science, geography and environmental studies. © 2018 Theresa Scavenius and Steve Rayner.

Nuclear power propulsion may be an option to de-carbonise some niches of the merchant ocean fleet. This paper considers the three experimental nuclear-powered merchant ships launched and operated in the world so far; the iconic Savannah (USA), Otto Hahn (West Germany) and Mutsu (Japan). They were independently developed and operated in the 1960s and 1970s for technology demonstration and learning. A fourth ship, Sevmorput (Soviet Union/Russia, 1988–to date), is a pioneer in respect of its logistics functions and propulsion system. This paper develops a theoretical framework for the sustainability assessment of nuclear propulsion in ocean merchant shipping and presents a method for exploring nuclear propulsion, relative to flag state, ports, shipping resources and ocean transport services. The experimental ships’ transport efficiency is discussed and related to contemporary oil-fired shipping of general cargo, and to recent literature presenting possible future applications of merchant nuclear propulsion in some market niches. Insights provided include: (1) the experiments demonstrate that merchant nuclear propulsion may be technically feasible; (2) port and canal access for merchant nuclear-powered ships may be difficult and restricted; (3) the up-front costs, refuelling and end-of-life decommissioning costs of nuclear-powered ships are vast and uncertain against conventionally-powered ships; (4) because nuclear fuel is comparatively low-cost, the conventional oil-fired ship cost implications of high-speed operations do not apply. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","De-carbonise; Experimental ships; Exploratory study; Nuclear propulsion; Ocean shipping; Transportation","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear propulsion; Oceanography; Propulsion; Ships; Transportation; De-carbonise; Exploratory studies; High-speed operation; Logistics functions; Ocean shipping; Sustainability assessment; Theoretical framework; Transport efficiency; Ship propulsion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020067670

A prestigious reference work, it offers original chapters by the world's most prominent thought leaders and surveys how the work of historical theorists has influenced and shaped consumption theory, both through history and at the cutting edge of research. Consumption is at the core of contemporary lifestyles, of political successes and failures and of discussions around sustainability and environmental change. Contemporary consumer culture shapes modern identities, and is the engine of the globalizing capitalist economy. Still, most social theorizations over the last century and a half have addressed production processes rather than consumption processes. This is about to change. Studies of consumption play an increasing role as a topic and a domain of study in marketing, anthropology, sociology and cultural studies. Currently, there is no single compilation that systematically links scholarly work published by the greatest social thinkers of the last 150 years to the understanding of contemporary consumer society. This book provides a solid framework for understanding the relevance of these canonical authors in social theory to facilitate analysis of consumer culture, and to act as a comprehensive reference point for consumer researchers, doctoral students and practitioners. © 2018 Søren Askegaard and Benoît Heilbrunn.

Given the prominence of co-creation, surprisingly little discussion has evolved around its implications for research practices and knowledge production as well as what challenges there are for fulfilling the promise of co-creation in tourism research. This book aims to contribute to this discussion by addressing how tourism research comes together as a collaborative achievement and by exploring different ways of collaborative knowledge production in tourism research. It is structured to offer, on one hand, an introduction to the ontological basis for collaborative research and, on the other hand, a set of empirical examples of how collaborative knowledge creation can inform tourism design, management, policy and education. The theoretical accounts and empirical cases of this book display how research collaborations can offer modest, local yet often impactful insights, traces and effects. It therefore will be of value for students, researchers and academics in tourism studies as well as the wider social sciences. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Carina Ren, Gunnar Thór Jóhannesson and René van der Duim.

Theoretically, two prevalent opposing narratives in the public discourse are presented and linked to two crude versions of mercantilism and economic liberalism in the scholarly literature. The mercantilist line of reasoning posits that China will gain more political weight with its increasing economic strength. The economic liberal line of reasoning suggests that China’s economic weight does not translate into political power. These two opposing theoretical claims are examined by process tracing two most likely cases. This article concludes that despite its increased economic strength, China has enjoyed limited success in persuading the EU and its member states to change their position(s) on policy areas involving strategic interests. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Dalai Lama; depression; Eu-China relations; liberalism; market economy status; mercantilism; Tibet",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017098980

Using IUCN Protected Area categories, a values framework is developed and applied to demonstrate how values guide stewardship in protected areas. In-depth interviews with key tourism operators, public sector managers and other stakeholders from the iconic World Heritage Site and tourism destination, Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) reveal how shifting ideologies and government policies increased pressures on nature, resulting in new alliances between stewards from the tourism sector and national and international organisations. These alliances were built on shared nature conservation values and successfully reduced increasing development pressures. Three distinct phases in this process emerged at the GBR, which were driven by personal values held by tourism industry representatives, and their recognition of tourism's reliance on nature for business success. Changing mainstream ideologies and political values can erode World Heritage and Protected Areas, and recalibrate values–including the universal values on which World Heritage Sites depend–towards more anthropocentric interpretations. The values framework presented here could be a powerful tool for stewards involved in conservation to remind those who merely manage and govern of the original nature-focused values. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Great Barrier Reef; IUCN; Stewardship; tourism; UNESCO World Heritage; values","environmental values; nature conservation; protected area; stakeholder; tourism management; tourist destination; UNESCO; World Heritage Site; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014655106

Partly this was about their (in)applicability to the distinctive features of government organizations, in particular their focus on public as well as private value, their situation in a political rather than a market environment, their almost exclusive capacity to use legal authority to achieve purposes, and the extent to which they often need to share power over personnel and resources with other public sector agencies. These and other factors complicated efforts to apply New Public Management and similar frameworks in strategy concepts in a governmental context. Partly also the traditional private-sector focus on single organizations did not resonate with the growth of network governance from the 1990s. The authors argue for an alternative model based primarily on the public value framework as a means of incorporating and going beyond traditional strategy thinking. © 2017 by the authors.

The analysis directs toward a transition from an economic cluster to a collaborative community in order to increase business potential and to overcome limitations of smallness and inadequate competencies of the Greenlandic business community in the mining industry. Transitioning into a collaborative community creates more value by enabling member firms to realize business development that each single firm could not achieve with its own efforts by being a part of a cluster. Managing the transition process emphasizes the facilitating role for the reason that a shared service provider is required in every collaborative community. I develop a conceptual model for the transition from an economic cluster to a collaborative community based on the architectural elements of the collaborative community design.

While there are several explanations and terms mentioned in the literature for the same concept, this research incorporates all the works related to sourcing innovation and synthesizes them under the umbrella ‘sourcing innovation’. This research adopts [87] definition of sourcing innovation as an ‘affair between two firms’ and broadens it in accordance with today’s supply chain relationship perspective. This research paper attempts to propose a boarder definition based on sourcing personnel perspectives and to recommend key dominant capabilities and observable practices that would help in enriching the practice of sourcing innovation based on the extant supply chain management literature. This is an exploratory study that includes five semi-structured interviews accomplished within five Danish firms. As sourcing innovation presents many challenges to organizations, this research not only conceptualizes the notion in terms of practice but also identifies dominant capabilities and observable practices to operationalize it. In consideration of dynamic market environment, this research advocates firms to practice sourcing innovation from dynamic capability perspective so that they could innovate more efficiently through intense strategic collaboration with their supply chain partners. In addition, this form of strategic collaboration would support firms in acquiring win-win innovations and achieving solid growth as well as sustainable competitive advantage.

The process leading up to the Hedonic Haptic player served as a first step in getting a grasp of the design space of vibrotactile stimuli in a broader sense.

We propose this as a humanistic design philosophy which may inform the design of future wearable health technology, in contrast to increasing trends toward the medicalization and quantification of people’s whole lives. At the same time, there is a pragmatic case to be made for more human-centred approaches to the design of assistive technologies for the body, which are frequently rejected by end users due to poor cultural (as well as physical) fit. We examine the potential socio-phenomenological framework offered by the accessory as a relational category of both expressive and functional objects. Using Cunningham’s framework of narrative contemporary jewellery, we analyse three projects, and show how the accessory can function as a complex platform to support relations between maker, wearer and viewer. Finally, we relate this approach to the debate in interactive wearable design regarding the visibility of technology on the body, and propose a shift from designing wearable health technologies with minimal “social weight,” to providing a relational platform capable of supporting what we have termed “social agility.” © 2017 Møller & Kettley.","Accessory approach; Accessory design; Body adornment; Persons with diverse needs; Wearable health technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040035368

There are indications that there may be enforcement problems in this area. Such problems can be mitigated or even eliminated if EU law sets clear standards for how enforcement should be conducted. Against this backdrop, this article examines what EU law requires from the Member States when enforcing EU company law. Even though the harmonisation of EU company law seldom addresses the question of how the rules should be enforced, EU law in different ways sets bounds to how the enforcement should be conducted. These bounds are set by the requirement for effective enforcement of EU law formulated by the CJEU by free movement rights, fundamental rights and other general principles of EU law. There are so many cases dealing with this issue that it is possible to outline these bounds mainly by analysing cases dealing with company law issues. As a consequence of these bounds, the Member States may have some discretion in deciding the penalties, but they are far from free to do so. If there are major differences in how Member States enforce EU company law, this may cause major problems for the functioning of the internal market. For this reason there is a need to keep a close eye on the enforcement of EU company law in the Member State and, if necessary, harmonise aspects of the enforcement. © 2017, T.M.C.

In 2004 Scott and colleagues published a meta-analysis of all creativity training programs to date, and the review presented here sat out to identify and analyze studies published since the seminal 2004 review. Focusing on quantitative studies of creativity training programs for adults, our systematic review resulted in 22 publications. All studies were analyzed, but comparing the reported effectiveness of training across studies proved difficult due to methodological inconsistencies, variations in reporting of results as well as types of measures used. Thus a consensus for future studies is called for to answer the question: Which elements make one creativity training program more effective than another? This is a question of equal relevance to academia and industry, as creativity training is a tool that can contribute to enhancement of organizational creativity and subsequently innovation.

In this article, we investigate recent institutional changes in the three Nordic countries following the Ghent model, Finland, Sweden and Denmark, and analyse the consequences for union and fund membership. These countries have witnessed different combinations of two types of reform, less attractive unemployment benefits plus new institutional alternatives to the traditional union-run funds, and this has led to different outcomes in each country. Benefit retrenchment and increased contributions led to a sharp decline in fund membership in Sweden, whereas this trend is less pronounced in Finland and Denmark. Instead, the main trend here has been a shift from union-led to alternative forms of fund membership, but in different ways. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Denmark; Finland; Ghent system; institutional change; Nordic labour markets; Sweden; unemployment insurance funds; unionization; welfare state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034613199

Product developers can choose to design products according to an environmentally favorable EoL scenario. Such strategies may also assist societies in the transition to a more circular economy. However, at the end of a product's useful life, it is uncertain whether the end users will handle the product according to the original intention of the product developers. Situated within this context, this research investigated how end users perceive three EoL scenarios (reuse, recycling and remanufacturing) and two disposal methods (door-to-door collection and delivery at point of purchase) for eight household electrical and electronic products (e-products) spanning a representative range of product categories. To this end, a quantitative Kano survey (N = 146) was used to classify product features related to EoL and disposal methods according to users' preferences. An extension developed by the authors was also deployed to identify differences within user segments in terms of demographic (e.g., age, gender, education level) and relevant psychographic variables (e.g., environmental awareness). Taken collectively, the results showed that the majority of EoL scenarios were actually regarded as attractive features in the Kano framework, meaning that users would be very satisfied with a product that can be disposed of according to a favorable EoL scenarios, but may not have any prior expectations at point of purchase. Reuse potential emerged as the most attractive EoL scenario, suggesting that users' preferences are largely aligned with the concept of circular economy. Interestingly, women were found to prefer all EoL scenarios more than men, and were also more willing to pay a premium price for environmentally friendly e-products. These results suggest that gender may be the most important basis for user segmentation (e.g. in the context of product development), and that products targeted towards women are more likely to enter favorable EoL scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; End of life; Product design","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Door-to-door collection; Electrical and electronic products; Electronic appliances; End of lives; Environmental awareness; Product categories; Product developers; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030663413

With respect to other bioplastics the market share of poly-hydroxyalkanoates is still limited because of their commercial costs. To develop more cost-effective processes, a multilevel approach is usually undertaken combining innovative, cheaper and more effective microbial cultivation with safe and cheap extraction and purification methodologies. This study assesses the potential life cycle environmental impacts related to a novel protocol poly-hydroxyalkanoates extraction based on dimethyl carbonate in comparison to the use of halogenated hydrocarbons (in particular 1,2 dicholoroethane). Four scenarios are analysed for the dimethyl carbonate protocol considering: extraction from microbial slurry or from dried biomass, and recovery by solvent evaporation or polymer precipitation. The life cycle assessment demonstrates that the environmental performances of dimethyl carbonate-based protocols are far better than those of the most comparative process using the halogenated hydrocarbons. The scenario that foresees the extraction of dried biomass and recovers solvent by evaporation appears to be the most promising in terms of environmental sustainability performance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-based polymers; Bioplastics; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Environmental performance; Poly-hydroxyalkanoates","Biocompatibility; Biodegradable polymers; Biological materials; Biomass; Carbonation; Competition; Cost effectiveness; Ecodesign; Environmental management; Evaporation; Extraction; Halogenation; Hydrocarbons; Life cycle; Polymers; Reinforced plastics; Sustainable development; Bio-based polymers; Bio-plastics; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Extraction and purifications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Poly-hydroxyalkanoates; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030656733

Knowledge about innovation and value co-creation within experience-based sectors has increased, but most studies focus on the initial steps of the innovation process. We argue that there is a need to focus on challenges that tourism management faces over time when it wishes to maintain innovations in an experience concept. Maintaining such innovations needs to be investigated from an organisational perspective. There are many reasons why it can be challenging to maintain innovative experience concepts over time. We address three important reasons and suggest an analytical model which employs four theoretical constructs namely, the experience concept, the experience system, internal engagement, and external engagement. We illustrate the model by applying it to three case vignettes from experience-based tourism.

We perform this policy evaluation by identifying demand fundamentals in a joint audit regime and applying them to a single audit regime. We find that a joint audit requirement has the potential to change the audit market structure substantially but that the effects are sensitive to the specific policy design. For example, small audit firms gain market share in a joint audit regime but only if an equal sharing of the workload between the two joint auditors is not required. Our counterfactual analysis reveals that the introduction of a joint audit regime would be associated with a substantial loss of consumer surplus. The loss results from restricting clients from giving all of the audit work to their most preferred audit firm, but it is partly offset by gains in consumer surplus deriving from the opportunity to choose the best combination of auditor pairs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Audit market structure; Consumer surplus; Demand estimation; Joint audit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029518119

The study focuses on three socio-cultural groups and the corresponding institutional contexts (an Anglo-Saxon group, a Central European group, and a Northern European group) and three MCS archetypes (delegated bureaucratic control, delegated output control, and programmable output control). We use unique data from a cross-national, interview-based survey encompassing 610 strategic business units from nine countries (seven European countries plus Canada and Australia). The idea that firms tend to adapt MCSs to the socio-cultural context does not gain empirical support in this study. No significant differences in the distribution of MCSs between the three socio-cultural groups are noted.

We follow Ehrenfeld (2004), who asked a similar question for the field of industrial ecology in this journal, and reflect on the major beliefs and concepts underpinning SBM research and practice, tools and resources, authorities and the related community of actors. These elements are considered characteristics of a field and must be institutionalised in academia, industry and government for a field to emerge and progress. We therefore also identify some institutionalisation tendencies. As a result, we conclude that SBM research and practice show traits of an emerging field. It is however too early to foresee if it will develop as a sub-field within already established domains (“sub-field hypothesis”) or as a stand-alone field (“stand-alone hypothesis”). We argue that the sub-field and the stand-alone positioning may hamper the unfolding of the field's full potential. Instead, we propose that the SBM field needs to assume the role of an integrative field to break existing academic niches and silos and maximise practical impact (“integration hypothesis”). Our observations indicate that the SBM field is indeed developing into an integrative field and force. But we need to better understand and strengthen this development, for example by crafting a dedicated SBM research programme. A series of critical reviews could be a starting point for such an endeavour. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Business model; Overview; Research and practice field; Sustainability","Sustainable development; Business modeling; Critical review; Industrial ecology; Institutionalisation; Overview; Practice fields; Research programmes; Sustainable business; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029229858

We do however find that intra- and inter-divisional embeddedness is positively related to dual headquarters involvement when the number of partners in the innovation project is relatively large.

But is it worthwhile for platform providers to conduct screening processes for third-party offerings, or should they rather apply a laissez-faire approach and let the market determine winners and losers? In this study, we compare the market conditions on Kickstarter, one of the world's largest crowdfunding platforms, before and after a policy change that relaxed the previously stringent screening process for new campaigns. By analyzing over 230,000 crowdfunding campaigns with a combined funding of over $1.9 billion that cover a 4-year period around the policy change, we find that increasing platform openness was a double-edged sword for the platform's ecosystem. While Kickstarter's revenue from commissions surged after the policy change due to an increase in the number of campaigns available on the platform, funding conditions for project creators and backers deteriorated. Project creators have to cope with lower success rates and an intensified competition due to a growing disproportion of backers to campaigns, while backers face higher uncertainties as project creators invest less in reducing information asymmetries. Our evidence from this natural experiment therefore suggests that increasing platform openness for third-party offerings can destabilize a platform's ecosystem. We thus extend the literature on platform openness and on the implications of policy changes on platform ecosystems. Our findings also provide practical insights for different platform stakeholders into possible ""ripple effects"" that are triggered when policy changes alter platform openness. © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust.","crowdfunding; input control; natural experiment; platform ecosystems; platform openness; policy change","Commerce; Ecology; Investments; crowdfunding; Natural experiment; Platform ecosystems; platform openness; Policy changes; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019019867

It can be assumed that stakeholder value impacts, both positive and negative, are particularly pronounced in emerging economies. We thus ask, what are the stakeholder value impacts of CC business models and how are they influenced by an emerging economy context? Based on case studies in transport and cleaning services in South Africa, we develop a model of the three-way interactions between local context, CC business model, and stakeholder value impacts. Further, we define CC business models as manifestations of two-sided markets, which allows us to better understand their positive and negative impacts on their key stakeholders. Our analysis shows that both new and established CC business models must be carefully adapted to local contexts to make best use of their potential to create stakeholder value and to avoid unintended negative impacts on vulnerable social groups. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Business model innovation; Collaborative consumption; Context; Sharing economy; Stakeholder value; Two-sided market","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Business model innovation; Collaborative consumption; Context; Sharing economy; Stakeholder values; Two-sided markets; Commerce; business; economic development; innovation; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018433289

Previous studies have found that the estimated models change over time, but the implications of the time-varying behavior have not been thoroughly examined. This paper presents an adaptive estimation approach that allows for the parameters of the estimated models to be time varying. It is shown that a two-state Gaussian hidden Markov model with time-varying parameters is able to reproduce the long memory of squared daily returns that was previously believed to be the most difficult fact to reproduce with a hidden Markov model. Capturing the time-varying behavior of the parameters also leads to improved one-step density forecasts. Finally, it is shown that the forecasting performance of the estimated models can be further improved using local smoothing to forecast the parameter variations.

We study a policy that expanded the use of electronic monitoring to address nonrandom selection into electronic monitoring instead of in prison. Results from a sample of 4,522 men show that home confinement under electronic monitoring significantly and persistently lowers the risk both of being single and of becoming single during the first five years following conviction.

It explores how goal definition and the choice of assessment metrics frame goal attainment and influence implementation behaviour. Using the Danish capital of Copenhagen for an in-depth case study, we map activities undertaken and assess implementation performance in terms of infrastructure changes and GHG emission reductions during the period from adoption of the first climate action plan in 2002 to the present day (2017). The study shows that while Copenhagen exhibits a high overall implementation performance, both in terms of changes in energy supply and emission reductions, these metrics are only partially linked. It also shows that inconsistencies between the system scope of the base year emissions and goal attainment, due to the use of offsetting, may lead to system developments that inhibit further changes beyond the initial target period. The article concludes with a list of lessons learned for other cities that are in earlier stages of climate planning. Most importantly, the study points to the need for activity-related evaluation metrics, scope consistency, and targets that can provide a robust incentive through changing energy systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment; Energy transition; Implementation; Indicators; Mitigation; Monitoring","Carbon; Emission control; Indicators (instruments); Monitoring; Assessment; Assessment metrics; Emission reduction; Energy transitions; Evaluation metrics; Implementation; Mitigation; System development; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029682196

Cabrils, km 2, Cabrils, Barcelona  08348, Spain","Food diet choices can have a considerable effect on climate change as around 15-30% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions correspond to the food sector. Life-cycle assessment has been an effective tool to evaluate the environmental impact of food production, normally using mass as the functional unit (FU). As this is not always able to reproduce the consumption of different foods and their nutritional value, alternative nutrient-related FUs that can do so should be used. The present study assesses, quantifies and compares the nutritional quality and the environmental impact of two different food diets, a Mediterranean diet (MD), which includes meat-source products and fish, and a vegan diet (VD), which only includes plant-based products. The nutritional quality index NRF9.3 and the impact categories of global warming potential (GWP) and regional biodiversity impact (RBI) due to land use (LU) are assessed for both diets. The VD resulted to have a higher nutritional quality than the MD mainly as it contained less disqualifying nutrients like saturated fat, added sugars and sodium and more qualifying nutrients, although some likely micronutrients deficiencies like B12 in the VD are not assessed here. All the environmental impacts were much higher for the MD, mainly due to the presence of livestock products and fish, which on average had the highest GWP and LU values of all products studied. The GWP, mostly dominated by the food production stage compared to cooking and transport, was around twice as high in the MD. The LU, in livestock products dominated by the land requirements of feedcrops in more than a 99%, was around three times higher in the MD. Finally, the RBI of the MD was also around three times higher than the VD's, although this could be underestimated as fish biodiversity has not been assessed. Impact differences between diets increased when impacts were adjusted by the NRF9.3, which demonstrates that the nutritional quality of diets affects the comparison of the environmental impacts. In an attempt to provide a possible solution to the tightly linked diet-environment-health trilemma, it is concluded that a shift towards a mix of these two diets, where all nutrients are consumed in the recommended levels and where only the least environmental impacting livestock products are consumed, would maybe help reducing GHG emissions, deforestation and biodiversity loss, as well as preventing diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Biodiversity; Deforestation; Diseases; Fish; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Meats; Nutrients; Nutrition; Thermal processing (foods); Biodiversity loss; Cardio-vascular disease; Functional units; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mediterranean diet; Nutritional qualities; Nutritional value; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019044944

Meyers Vænge 15, Copenhagen, 2450, Denmark","Direct digital manufacturing (DDM) is a combination of product modeling and manufacturing technology that directly converts digital models to physical objects without the need for tooling. The capability of DDM to improve the sustainability of products and processes is based on changing operational practices in product design, distribution, use, and after-sales services. Although research has provided evidence of the potential impact of DDM technologies, there is limited research on how specific DDM-based operational practices add to the operational capabilities of a manufacturer and how these capabilities can be used to improve sustainability outcomes. To address this research gap, we evaluate how current and future DDM-based operational practices can be used to improve products and processes. The analyzed current practices are in prototyping, tooling, on-demand parts manufacturing, and customized parts manufacturing. Two future practices that are evaluated are DDM-based incremental product improvement and dynamic supply chain reconfiguration. Based on the evaluation of current and future practices, we propose a design theory for the introduction of DDM into manufacturing firms for improving sustainability capabilities. The key contribution of this article is specifying the mechanisms by which a specific DDM-based operational practice improves sustainability outcomes and how each practice creates an operational practice threshold that needs to be reached before further improvement of capabilities is possible. Thus, using the theory new operational practices can be proactively developed and tested before the next threshold is reached. This in turn will help manufacturers develop strategies and investment plans for current and future DDM-based practices and to accumulate sustainability capabilities faster. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Design theory; Direct digital manufacturing; Dynamic supply chain reconfiguration; Incremental product improvement; Operational practice; Sustainability","Dynamics; Investments; Manufacture; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Design theory; Digital manufacturing; Dynamic supply chains; Operational practices; Product improvement; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016064264

On the other hand, marketing literature suggests that researchers neglected technical issues related to core acquisition in a CLSC while discussing consumers' disposition behaviors. We propose a conceptual framework that extends the existing CLSC setting by introducing consumers’ disposition behavior. We develop eleven research propositions based on which we design a survey. The survey was sent to decision making executives of different remanufacturing industries to solicit their perception. Participants were also asked to make paired comparisons using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), based on which an action oriented framework is developed. Firms that have CLSC operation can use our framework to ensure enhanced quality product returns which in turn increase profitability.

This paper investigates to what degree the economy is greening horizontally (sector-wise). Starting with a sectoral case study, we undertake a longitudinal analysis of the breath and strength of the greening of the automotive sector from 1965 to 2012, focusing on powertrain technologies. The empirical analysis is based on patent data amongst big car producers and focuses on identifying changes in two main aspects: (1) the convergence/divergence of firms’ green strategies and technologies within the automotive sector; and (2) the contribution of alternative key green technological trajectories relative to the dominant design. Our findings indicate that the evolution of relative green patenting has followed a positive, linear growth over the last decades with increasing participation of alternative propulsion technologies and increasing convergence of automakers’ strategies towards a diversified portfolio. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automotive sector; Eco-innovation; evolutionary theory; green economy; sectoral dynamics","automobile industry; economic diversification; economic growth; empirical analysis; evolutionary theory; green economy; industrial technology; innovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018411718

It was previously demonstrated that bioaugmentation of Methanoculleus bourgensis MS2T in an ammonia inhibited process in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), resulted in up to 90% recovery of the methane production compared to the uninhibited production. However, cultivation of pure strains has practical difficulties due to the need of special growth media and sterile conditions. In contrast, acclimatized enriched cultures have minor sterility requirements. In the current study, an enriched ammonia-tolerant methanogenic culture was bioaugmented in a CSTR reactor operating under ammonia-induced, inhibited-steady-state. The results demonstrated that bioaugmentation, completely counteracted the ammonia toxicity effect. This indicates that a commercial application of bioaugmentation could improve up to 36% the methane production, the greenhouse gas reduction efficiency and the gross revenue of ammonia inhibited full scale biogas reactors. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that bioaugmentation changed the microbial composition of the reactors resulting in higher bacterial and lower archaeal community diversity. The bioaugmented reactor showed a fourfold increase of the abundance of the bioaugmented methanogens compared to the control reactor. This indicates that ammonia-tolerant methanogens established well in the ammonia-inhibited reactor and dominated over the domestic methanogenic population. Finally, this study showed that the enriched culture alleviated ammonia toxicity 25% more efficiently than the previously used pure culture. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aceticlastic methanogen; Ammonia toxicity; Archaeon; Bacterium; Hydrogenotrophic methanogen","Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Methanogens; RNA; Toxicity; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Aceticlastic methanogen; Ammonia toxicity; Archaeon; Commercial applications; Continuous stirred tank reactor; Greenhouse gas reductions; Hydrogenotrophic methanogens; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029187092

It enables novel Product-Service Systems (PSS) that transform customer/supplier relationships and introduces new value propositions. However, while opportunities for novel types of PSS arise, it is not clear how digitization and the institutionalisation of digital capabilities, particularly within the customer organisations, may affect implementation of PSS, potentially leading to transformational changes in the customer organisation. This paper examines one such potential transformational change from three complementary viewpoints – the resource based, the dynamic, and the relational viewpoint. It does so through action research study in the context of the maritime industry, which is particularly attractive for PSS offerings. The research methodology comprised a two-step action research process, focusing on both digitization and PSS development and implementation. The main findings are that rather than facilitating procurement to co-development of PSS, institutionalisation of digital capabilities facilitated development of PSS by stakeholders internal to the company, and strategic co-development with external stakeholders.

While the major impacts are from transport energy use and emissions, very few studies attempted to examine the impacts from transport infrastructure, especially at a city or country level. This paper, taking Shenzhen in China (a fast developing megacity) as the case study, is specially designed to quantify the carbon footprint of the urban roads by using streamlined life cycle assessment method. For given years (ranged from 2004 to 2013), various activities of urban roads (e.g. newly planned road construction, maintenance of road in use, and road renovation and demolition) have been examined in this study. The results show that the total carbon footprint from urban roads in Shenzhen was 260 (±20) thousand tons CO2e in 2013. The major contributor was the materials use (embodied impact) from newly constructed roads, which accounts for 52.3% of the total carbon footprint, followed by the maintenance stage (24.3%). The eco-design process of road construction plays a vital role in achieving the effective carbon footprint reduction. These findings help to better understand the carbon footprint from urban roads in megacities, and provide useful inputs for policy making process in terms of identifying carbon reduction opportunities for the transport sector. In addition, the methodologies are useful for the quantification of carbon footprint in other cities of China and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; China; Shenzhen city; Streamlined life cycle assessment; Urban roads","Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Highway planning; Life cycle; Road construction; Roads and streets; Urban transportation; Carbon footprint reductions; Carbon reduction; China; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Shenzhen city; Transport infrastructure; Transport sectors; Urban road; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029142763

The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of the external service partner network of a European manufacturer providing services in China, in order to develop a better understanding of the resulting and associated challenges. Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth case study approach was used to examine the parent company, its subsidiary in China and the related service partner network. Data collection involved all three actors and took place in Denmark and China. Findings: The findings suggest that motivation, opportunity and ability (MOA) need not only be mutually reinforcing for the organization attempting to move toward services but also aligned between organizational units, as well as with the service partner network. Furthermore, the findings suggest that while service partners are typically closer to the market, they may not be able to deliver the higher value-added services requiring customization. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to a single manufacturer attempting servitization in China. Future studies may consider other case firms in other markets. Practical implications: The MOA framework provides a basis for understanding the managerial challenges of aligning and coordinating the MOA elements amongst different actors. Originality/value: This paper contributes by exploring servitization in an emerging market through the MOA framework in order to better understand the challenges and complexities. Servitization is found to be a dynamic phenomenon which should be understood as a movement that is also dependent on an external service partner possessing the necessary capabilities. In turn, this requires understanding the MOAs of all actors in a network and how they may be influenced in order for the MOA elements to be mutually reinforcing. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; MOA; Service network; Servitization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043329668

It further provides a unified model that utilizes interactions of nodes in an LBSN, i.e., users and locations, for capturing diverse types of information propagations. On the basis of these interactions, influential nodes can be found and their potential influence can be simulated and visualized using Google Maps and graph visualization APIs.Thus, IMaxer allows users to compare and pick the most suitable IM method in terms of effectiveness and cost. © 2017 ACM.",,"Commerce; Knowledge management; Location; Marketing; Graph visualization; Influence maximizations; Influential nodes; Information propagation; Location-based social networks; Models and algorithms; Number of methods; Unified Modeling; Social networking (online)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037363376

However, to date, there is limited knowledge and understanding of how, or indeed if, volunteer tourism organisations actually monitor and evaluate their programmes. The aim of this paper is to identify and critically examine the extent to which volunteer tourism organisations engage with the monitoring and evaluation of their projects. Based on a survey of 80 organisations and qualitative interviews with representatives from 29 organisations, the research found that monitoring and evaluation practices vary greatly. Participants readily accept a lack of time and resources as barriers to monitoring an evaluation, there is an assumption that any volunteer-host community interaction is positive, and despite voluntary guidelines, there is little incentive to prioritise monitoring and evaluation of volunteer programmes. A small number of volunteer organisations emerged as an exception to this overall pattern and are discussed. Discrepancies between stated importance of monitoring and evaluation and actual practices are examined and opportunities for improved practices identified. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","evaluation; Monitoring; responsible tourism; volunteer tourism","ecotourism; guideline; monitoring; qualitative analysis; tourism economics; tourism management; voluntary approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017470285

After having been under the main domination of management science both research and education has until recently widened its scope from a decision-making to an action-perspective. It seems to be a recent reconnection to pragmatism that makes the 2011 Carnegie report propose to rethink management in liberal arts terms, whilst the vastly influential 1959 Carnegie Pierson report distanced itself from American pragmatism thus focusing on decisions and forgetting actions. Actions may contain decisions and choices but contain more than that. A decision-perspective explains by causal inference modelling choices as calculated or programmed. The action-perspectives strive at understanding intentions of agents by philosophical interpretations of action stories. It is less limited to finding the logics for constructing worlds, to paraphrase Herbert Simon’s favorite philosopher Rudolf Carnap, than embarking on plausible, although not certain, reconstructions of intentions giving meaning to action stories. This can be illustrated by turning to Elizabeth Anscombe’s Wittgensteinian investigation of intentions as Aristotelian syllogistic reasoning. Her constant analytical care to defend a philosophy of action against metaphysical assumptions and taken-for-granted “psychologisms” shows that an action-perspective is as analytic as ever one of decision-making. What differs is that the latter seems constantly attracted by programming inquiry by “scientific methodology” whilst the latter is charmed by philosophical approaches to action welcoming fascinating conundrums, enigmas and human goofs in the reality of managerial practice. Management science wants to reduce management to logics, programs and models for formal decision making whereas management philosophy is closer to spotting the artfully entrepreneurial in actions. The latter points in the direction of engineering tools, the former to appreciate the toys of management as artwork. Finally the argument of Georg Henrik von Wright helps us see that the two are philosophically compatible; for in a pragmatically inspired management philosophy actions may well contain decisions. © 2017, The Author(s).","Decision making; Intention; Interpretation; Logical empiricism; Philosophy of action; Syllogism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058567455

A vast, influential literature has detailed the ways in which ties facilitate the flow of information about job opportunities to workers as well as endorsements or referrals of workers to firms.We propose that this role is not constrained to an informational one alone. Rather, relationships between workers can enable a collective job-matching process that facilitates the transfer of shared human capital from one organization to another. Yet ""comobility"" has been studied only occasionally and among elite workers in particular industries. This study delivers both fieldwork as well as large-sample analysis among all nongovernmental workers in Denmark, finding a 5.5% wage premium for those who move jointly instead of independently, both in the full sample as well as when applying strict matching or fixed effects for workers or firms. Co-movers whose skills are related but not identical capture a higher premium, and the wage gains associated with comobility are not limited to highly skilled workers but rather obtain across a wide range of occupations. Robustness tests establish that the wage premium associated with comobility is not driven by efforts to capture ""prized"" workers, by employee referrals, or by aggressive hiring by firms. This study provides the first quantification of the anticipated value of comobility, suggesting that both workers and firms may want to revisit individualistic assumptions about how labor markets function.

We argue that performance in this setting hinges on three tasks: opportunity recognition, problem solving, and implementation. We theorize that cognitive ability at the individual level has a positive effect on opportunity recognition and problem solving but no clear effect on implementation. Within teams, a combination of higher and lower cognitive ability levels may be productive insofar as some individuals can be assigned to mundane tasks (that are often involved in implementation), while others can be assigned to tasks that impose a greater cognitive load (problem solving or opportunity recognition). We present the results of a field experiment in which 573 students in 49 teams started up and managed real companies.We ensured exogenous variation in-otherwise random-team composition by assigning students to teams based on their measured cognitive abilities. Each team performed a variety of tasks, often involving complex decision making. The key result of the experiment is that the performance of start-up teams first increases and then decreases with ability dispersion. Strikingly, average team ability is not related to team performance. © 2017 INFORMS.","Ability dispersion; Entrepreneurship; Field experiment; Team performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039735431

Our study contributes to recent literature on institutional pluralism by further specifying the structural aspects of constellations of logics and different types of institutional pluralism (monolithic, fragmented, and modular).

The networks originated from an institutional setting in which local authorities have been the largest resource grabber and where personal ties have mainly determined resource allocation decisions. Residents who are capable of using networks to operate via the back door thus get rich, but their dependence on networks also poses constraints on their anti-demolition protests. By contrast, residents who are incapable of using networks tend to lag behind, but their marginalised status unexpectedly offers them greater autonomy to negotiate a better bargain with local authorities. The differences reveal a “half-open” state control through resources allocation, which seems to work for residents who have intensive interactions with local authorities but not for others who are self-sufficient. The existence of networks sheds light on the importance of local politics in determining Chinese protests and has not been amply discussed in recent years. Networks also reinforce the operational rationale of “relational repression”, shaped not only by sanctions and sentiments but also by benefits. © China: An International Journal.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039545040

The social partners in the public sector in Denmark (and the other Nordic countries) engage in negotiations and reach agreements regarding wages and working conditions in accordance with an institutional set-up developed in the private sector. This also applies to the use of the so-called weapons of conflict – strikes/blockades and lock-outs/boycotts – in connection with labour disputes if the parties are unable to reach agreement through negotiations or mediation. But there is a big difference in the premises and conditions upon which collective industrial conflict as an institutionalised form of collective action proceeds when comparing the public and private sectors in Denmark. The article shows how the use of collective industrial conflicts in the public sector has a number of built-in systemic institutional flaws, as the public employers are the budgetary authority and legislators at the same time. This is not a new finding; however, these multiple roles become problematic when public employers use the lock-out weapon offensively in combination with state intervention to end the dispute, which was the case during the teacher lock-out in 2013 in Denmark. The article concludes with the presentation of a number of proposed institutional adjustments for bringing the public bargaining model into balance. © 2017, © Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA), SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.","Collective action; industrial conflict; lockout; public sector; strikes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034422814

Our empirical analysis is based on two longitudinal surveys and hypothetical choice exercises conducted on Ethiopian farmers. We find that locus of control significantly predicts farmers’ technology adoption decisions, including use of chemical fertilizers, improved seeds, and irrigation. We show that individuals with an internal locus of control have higher propensity of adopting agricultural technologies. We observe these empirical regularities in both datasets, and for both revealed measures of farmers’ technology adoption decisions as well as farmers’ hypothetical demand for agricultural technology. The results hold even in a more conservative fixed effects estimation approach, assuming locus of control as time-variant and dynamic behavioral trait. These findings provide behavioral and psychological explanations for the low rates of adoption of profitable agricultural technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our results highlight that improving farmers’ non-cognitive skills (locus of control) may facilitate technology adoption and agricultural transformation. More generally, the results suggest that anti-poverty policies that only focus on relaxing short-term external constraints, including physical access to markets and technologies, may not sufficiently alleviate agricultural underinvestment. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural investment; Behavioral biases; Chemical fertilizers; Internal constraints; Locus of control; Technology adoption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033470680

Yet, the role of spectacles in organizational life has remained under-researched in organization studies. As the boundaries between fact and fiction, reality and representation, substance and appearance become increasingly blurred, questions about the production and effects of spectacles seem more pertinent than ever. Are representations faithful mirrors of reality, or attempts to conceal reality? Do they replace reality, or bring new realities into being?

The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental impacts arising from the increase in demand for building refurbishments in New Zealand using consequential Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The study focused on the identification of resource constraints and marginal suppliers of construction materials using market information specific to New Zealand. Building refurbishment strategies related to waste minimization at construction sites and use of recycled materials at production sites were compared. According to the results, increasing the rates of construction waste recovery and re-use at site can reduce the overall environmental impact of a building refurbishment by 15–25% compared to use of construction materials with recycled content which only reduces the environmental impacts by approximately 5%. The net impact results were sensitive to the quality of recyclable material, location of the marginal supplier and marginal energy source.

This paper examines the implications of rehabilitation within Danish homecare work, a type of work that is often stigmatized due to its associations with low-status ‘dirty’ body work in old people's homes. The paper combines two research traditions: studies of dirty work and studies of body work. It draws on observations and focus groups in Denmark to explore how the introduction of rehabilitation changes the work of care workers, and how such changes are associated with a potential reshaping of stigma. In contrast to previous research, this paper shows that although rehabilitation was partly introduced to reduce stigma of this type of work, the practice of rehabilitation paradoxically reinforces the stigma that it attempts to manage. Thus, the analysis helps to improve our understanding of the ambiguous and varying ways rehabilitative eldercare reshapes and reinforces stigma and gender stereotypes among women who do ‘dirty’ body work. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","body work; dirty work; gender; rehabilitative eldercare; stigma","elderly care; gender issue; stereotypic behavior; womens status; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028312078

However, since lighting is a highly cultural and socio-material phenomenon, this article argues that current ways of using light cannot be attributed to the properties of the light sources alone. It is therefore important to understand how and why lighting is used in particular ways, and what that implies for energy-consumption. This article explores how current Danish ways of ‘illuminating’ have come about as a result of dynamics within and across various household- and professional practices, by presenting a historical account of particular spatio-temporal moments in the development of domestic lighting. The analysis unfolds how a number of lighting-related practices seem to have influenced each other and that these practices have been (re-) configured in particular ways due to certain social-political arrangements (such as breaks with dominant philosophical tendencies in lifestyles as well as lighting design), cultural-discursive arrangements (such as emphasis on increasing energy demand vs. emphasis on decreasing energy demand), and material-economic arrangements (such as the design of buildings, configurations of electrical grids and infrastructures). In developing this account, particular attention is paid to how the performativity of practices with a shared goal of ‘doing light within the home’ is embedded in as well as emerging from the constitution, institutionalization and modifications of these wider practice-arrangements related to the provisioning and consumption of lighting. In doing so, this research extends the current field of social practice theoretical understandings of innovation and consumption dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Change; Energy; Lighting; Practice-architectures; Provision and consumption; Social practices","Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Light sources; Philosophical aspects; Change; Design of buildings; Energy; Energy efficient lighting; Professional practices; Provision and consumption; Reducing energy consumption; Social practices; Lighting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028310305

Amongst various production systems that comprise the pig industry, grain-based intensive production is widely regarded as the largest polluter of the environment, and thus it is imperative to develop alternative systems that can provide the right balance between sustainability and food security. Using an original dataset from the Republic of Ireland, this paper examines the life-cycle environmental impacts of representative pig farms operating under varying production efficiencies. For the baseline farm with an average production efficiency, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP) and eutrophication potential (EP) per kg carcass weight departing the slaughterhouse were estimated to be 3.5 kg CO2-eq, 43.8 g SO2-eq and 32.1 g PO4-eq, respectively. For herds with a higher production efficiency, a 9% improvement in feed conversion ratio was met by 6%, 15% and 12% decreases in GWP, EP, AP, respectively. Scenario and sensitivity analyses also revealed that (a) a switch to high-protein diets results in lower GWP and higher AP and EP, and (b) reducing transportation distances by sourcing domestically produced wheat and barley does not lower environmental impacts in any notable manner. To improve cross-study comparability of these findings, results based on an auxiliary functional unit, kg liveweight departing the farm gate, are also reported. © 2017 The Authors","Environmental footprint; Feed composition; Feed conversion ratio; Life cycle assessment; Pig production","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Food supply; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Mammals; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Environmental footprints; Feed compositions; Feed conversion ratios; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pig production; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028083757

However, to enhance the financial and ecological impact of the network, the forward and reverse supply chain networks must integrate well so that decisions taken in both areas complement each other. In this study, we propose an eco-efficient CLSC design for extending the existing supply chain of an Indian firm that assembles inkjet printers. The network design is configured as a multi-objective model in a multi-period setting and is mathematically formulated into a mixed integer programming problem with fuzzy objectives. Fuzziness provides flexibility to the decision makers because they must accommodate the conflicting nature of the objectives. The fuzzy multi-objective model incorporates the firm's economic and environmental concerns into the decision making process by selecting environmentally responsible suppliers to procure components based on sustainable criteria, choosing appropriate recovery options for end-of-use (EOU) inkjet printers, and planning an efficient transportation network design for reducing the carbon emission of the distribution and collection activities. The uniqueness of the proposed fuzzy CLSC optimization model lies in providing an integrated decision making framework that can aid the manufacturer in making crucial strategic, tactical, and operational decisions of optimal selection of suppliers, component order allocation, recovery flow allocation, and vehicle routing planning. The novelty of the model also lies in simultaneously minimising the overall cost of the activities undertaken, maximizing the performance of the component suppliers and minimising the carbon emissions of the associated transportation activities. A weighted fuzzy mathematical programming approach is utilised for generating a fuzzy, properly efficient solution as the desired compromised solution for the CLSC network problem configuration. The relevance of the model is justified using a real data set derived from a case study of the firm based in the northern capital region (NCR) of India. The findings indicate that the proposed integrated CLSC network model enables the firm in gaining sustainably from the numerous electronic product reuse opportunities in the Indian market. Further, while costly to begin with, choosing suppliers with higher sustainable performance and vehicles with lesser emission rate could substantially enhance firm's sustainable image and result in higher profits in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; Carbon emission; Factor analysis; Fuzzy multi-objective programming; k-means clustering; Supplier selection","Automobile manufacture; Decision making; Environmental impact; Factor analysis; Ink jet printers; Integer programming; Mathematical programming; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Printing machinery; Printing presses; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Vehicle routing; Carbon emissions; Closed-loop supply chain networks; Closed-loop supply chains (CLSC); Fuzzy mathematical programming; K-means clustering; Multiobjective programming; Properly efficient solutions; Supplier selection; Computer system recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028059919

A proper assessment is needed to provide broader aspects for long-term sustainability. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the environmental sustainability of a biorefinery based on lignocellulosic biomass feedstock using emergy analysis and to propose the method to minimize material consumption and waste. The concept of emergy is to express the record of all resources used by the biosphere in earlier steps to produce a product or service, in term of solar energy equivalence. This idea provides the quantitative indicators involving the resource use and the percent renewability of the systems. For the proposed biorefinery model, Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) grown in Thailand was used as lignocellulosic feedstock. An emergy assessment was performed in two parts, comprised of the evaluation of the feedstock cultivation and of a biorefinery producing liquid fuels, methanol, steam, electricity and other by products, i.e., high purity CO2, sulfur. The emergy results revealed that the bio-based products depend mostly on non-renewable resources used in both biomass cultivation and biorefinery stages. For Napier grass cultivation, most of the emergy support came from local resources in term of evapotranspiration of Napier grass (33%) and the diesel consumption during the cultivation process (21%). The emergy sustainability indicator of the cultivation was 0.81. The emergy sustainability indicator of the whole process from cultivation to biorefinery stages dropped to 0.25, since the biorefinery section required solely economic inputs of which most were non-renewable. In conclusion, the implementation of the integrated biorefinery concept could minimize material consumption and waste generation and it also has higher performance in terms of the emergy compared to other existing processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Combined heat and power; Emergy assessment; Methanol; Napier grass","Bioconversion; Biomass; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Feedstocks; Industrial chemicals; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Refining; Solar energy; Biorefineries; Combined heat and power; Emergy assessment; Environmental performance assessment; Environmental sustainability; Lignocellulosic feedstocks; Napier grass; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028055860

In a quasi-experimental research design using panel data, survey responses from more than 2,000 employees before and after the implementation were generated, in addition to qualitative interviews with change agents. Findings indicate how differences in leadership during the ICT implementation process have an important impact on performance after the implementation. Mobilization of initial support, directive leadership through information and technical assistance, participative leadership through employee involvement, and locally adapted implementation processes are important leadership factors associated with performance. The article concludes by discussing broader perspectives of the study and implications for practice, theory, and future research. © 2017 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021898091

The biogas has potentials to substitute diesel as the vehicle fuel. In this paper, we examine the whole chain of biogas utilisation (biomass supply, biogas production and distribution, and fuel substitution) from both environmental and economic perspectives. We find that with low/high biomass supply potentials, the saved greenhouse gas emissions range from 0.89 to 1.66 million tons/2.19 to 4.27 million tons CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent). The soil carbon stock could increase 52310/124770 tons with low/high biomass supply potentials (measured as remaining carbon in soil in 100 years after application of digestate into soil). The biogas plant owners can obtain a return of investment ranging from 10.78% to 13.62% depending on biomass supply potentials and biogas production technologies. The farmers can save up to 717.93 and 1382.1 million DKK (Danish krone) by substituting mineral P (phosphorus) and N (nitrogen) fertilisers with low biomass supply potential and 1.74 and 3.44 billion DKK with high biomass supply potential. Finally, the vehicle users have incentives to use biogas because of its cost advantage. However, there are also some potential barriers and uncertainties in achieving the green transition, e.g. initial investment for CO2 conversion equipment and diesel-vehicle users’ sunk costs, which could require suitable policy supports. We suggest that using biogas in heavy-duty vehicles could be an effective way to reduce carbon emissions in the transport sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Energy conversion and substitution; Greenhouse gas emission; Heavy metal; Renewable energy; Soil carbon stock","Biogas; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy conversion; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heavy metals; Investments; Soils; Vehicles; Conversion equipment; Economic perspective; Environmental economics; Heavy duty vehicles; Potential barriers; Renewable energies; Return of investments; Soil carbon stock; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019033954

Budgets are one of the most widely used management tools in organizations, and several conceptual articles claim that the way in which they are used, most notably in an interactive way, affects middle managers' autonomous strategic actions (ASA). This type of entrepreneurial behavior in established firms focuses on opportunities outside the firms' currently served product-market domains. Using structural equation modeling and a formative measurement instrument for interactive use of budgets, we test these claims advanced in conceptual literature within a broad sample of large firms. We find that the way in which budgets are used does not significantly impact middle managers' engagement in ASA.

Limited attention has been paid to the disciplines that originally established the concept—anthropology, sociology, and psychology. These disciplines have examined ethnocentrism as a positive, neutral, or negative phenomenon with a complex hierarchical structure. IB literature, in turn, has almost exclusively adopted a negative view, suggesting that ethnocentrism hinders adoption of a global strategy. This article borrows insights from the three base disciplines to rethink the concept of ethnocentrism in IB research and to draw implications for global strategy research. The article also calls for a more careful borrowing of concepts from other disciplines. Managerial summary: This article is about ethnocentrism. Ethnocentric people tend to believe that their group, organization, culture, or ethnicity is superior to others. Ethnocentrism can exist in international business, for instance, where home country staff consider themselves superior to foreign staff in other countries. In international business research, ethnocentrism is usually considered undesirable, something that should be eliminated. However, sociology, anthropology, and psychology, where the concept was originally established, have adopted a wider, far more nuanced and intellectually richer view that also acknowledges the neutrality and benefits of ethnocentrism. We draw on this more refined view to rethink ethnocentrism in international business and show implications for global strategy research.

Recursive models, in contrast, allow phases to repeat, thus, incorporating iteration. The authors acknowledge the concerns voiced in futures studies that while models based on practical experience are common in the literature, forming a theoretical basis for why those practices work is often considered elusive. This includes models that imply linearity and those that accommodate iterativity. With theory from science and technology studies (STS) on knowledge production, the authors explain transition from one phase to the next and iteration between and within phases based on social negotiation. To this end, the authors examine the interplay between the “scenario development” phase and the “scenario use” phase of a planning process with a non-governmental organization in Denmark. The upshot for facilitators is practical insight into how transition between phases and phase iteration in scenario planning can be identified, leveraged, and, thus, managed. The upshot for scholars is a related insight into why scenario planning is a kind of laboratory for futures studies wherein the future is experimented upon. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Scenario development; Scenario method; Scenario use; Science and technology studies; Sociology of science","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Scenario development; Scenario methods; Scenario use; Science and technology studies; Sociology of science; Iterative methods; nongovernmental organization; planning practice; science and technology; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013031407

Design/methodology/approach: This study is based upon a quantitative survey on Norwegian exporting SMEs. A total of 380 questionnaires were received representing 16.8 per cent response rate. A structural equation modelling analysis is carried out on the sample. Findings: The study finds positive and significant associations between the firm’s growth ambition and the pursuance of product and business model innovations. Moreover, the firm’s export degree and scope has a significant and positive association with its product innovation strategy, but the association with its business model innovation is significantly negative. Research limitations/implications: The study’s findings indicate that future studies should incorporate different types of innovation strategies since their associations with export performance differ substantially. Treating innovation as a general construct appears to be too simplistic. Practical implications: The study’s results indicate that focus on product innovation enhances the export performance of SMEs, but that focus on business model innovation has a negative impact. The latter may be too costly and distract focus from the firm’s core competences, whereas product innovation can be assumed to provide further competitive strength. Originality/value: By taking a holistic approach towards innovation, this study addresses a gap in the literature on innovation and exporting in SMEs in order to investigate the association between different types of innovation-based growth strategies and the firms’ export prosperity. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Export; Growth ambition; Growth strategy; Innovation types; Internationalization; Small- and medium-sized enterprises",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032576075

Our results demonstrate that respondents’ most prevalent semantic categories are ‘exciting,’ ‘educative,’ and ‘boring.’ Their responses fall into two main types: assertive speech acts providing factual descriptions and expressive speech acts providing more evaluative judgments.

It does so by reconsidering how to understand employee subjectivity and, specifically, why employees voluntarily embrace company-sponsored smartphones although they are fully aware of the damage that this technology creates in their personal lives. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Communication technology; dis-identification; fantasy; ideology; Slavoj Žižek; work–life balance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982276960

The purpose of this paper is to explore and explain how new ventures aim to break institutional arrangements (i.e. regulations, normative rules, and cultural-cognitive beliefs) protecting the field by introducing digitally enabled service innovations into health care markets. Design/methodology/approach: The study is qualitative and interpretative in nature and utilizes case study as a research strategy. The paper is based on data that were collected through narrative interviews and document analysis from seven new ventures participating in a start-up accelerator program. Findings: Results indicate that service innovations that require a change in the institutional structures of the health care system are enacted through three highly iterative key processes: institutional sensemaking that creates an understanding of prevailing institutional arrangements and that constructs meaning for institutional change efforts, theorization of change through linguistic device, and modifications of institutions by building legitimacy and mobilizing external constituencies. Practical implications: The findings provide practical insights into how new ventures struggle, navigate, and negotiate on specific alternatives related to institutional change while pursuing the introduction of innovations to market. Originality/value: This research extends the institutional perspective on service innovation by zooming into micro-level processes of institutional change driven by new ventures. The study develops the theory of institutional entrepreneurship by highlighting cognitive processes of change, and suggests incorporating “institutional thinking” more tightly into the study and management of service innovation. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digitalization of health care; Health services; Institutional change; Institutional entrepreneurship; Sensemaking; Service innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049158773

However, very few assessments include effects of the waste composition and waste LCAs often rely on poorly justified data from secondary sources. This study systematically quantifies the influence and uncertainty on LCA results associated with selection of waste composition data. Three archetypal waste management scenarios were modelled with the waste LCA model EASETECH based on detailed waste composition data from the literature. The influence from waste composition data on the LCA results was quantified with a step-wise Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) approach involving contribution, sensitivity, uncertainty and discernibility analyses. The waste composition data contributed significantly to the LCA results and the uncertainty associated with these results. The importance of 405 individual waste properties was evaluated in comparison with 345 technology parameters. Overall, less than 10 physico-chemical properties dominated the output uncertainty of the LCA results, although these properties had low sensitivity in the model. Moreover, the uncertainties associated with the physico-chemical properties were responsible for output uncertainties that spanned from impacts to benefits. The GSA approach applied in this study constitutes a valuable tool for systematically assessing the importance of waste composition and for consciously collecting and using waste composition data within LCAs of waste management systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Fractional composition; Global Sensitivity Analysis; Life Cycle Assessment; Physico-chemical composition; Uncertainty analysis; Waste composition","Chemical analysis; Chemical properties; Information management; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Fractional composition; Global sensitivity analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Physico-chemical composition; Waste composition; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027528822

An increase in customer awareness and pressures from stakeholders shifted manufacturers' focus; no longer were financial benefits the primary concern in the contemporary business environment. As a result, many innovative strategies were brought into the realm of manufacturing systems, such as lean, green, agile, and sustainable manufacturing practices. Sustainable manufacturing has been praised in recent years for its significant benefits directed at triple bottom line factors (social, environmental, and financial), but the majority of manufacturing strategies remain limited to either one or two factors. No reliable guidelines exist to guarantee the successful implementation of sustainable manufacturing; available literature fails to explore such a complex research topic. Minding this gap, this study takes the opportunity to analyze and identify effective sustainable manufacturing practices that may help in a specific domain. This study proposes a framework to achieve the research aim in an Indian context, where sustainability issues are especially relevant. Initially, the common sustainable manufacturing practices are collected from literature resources and validated with focus groups. Then, the collected practices are compared with one another with the assistance of case industry decision makers. To analyze the practices, a multi-criteria decision making methodology was adopted, specifically DEMATEL. From the case results, we determine that among 22 common sustainable manufacturing practices, promoting 6R (reduce, reuse, recycle, recover, redesign, and remanufacture) concepts reveals the greatest influence on implementation. Clearly, focusing on 6R concepts will effectively improve sustainable manufacturing implementation in the organization. Finally, this study sheds some light on the future opportunities hidden in this research area by providing contributions towards both scientific and social means. © 2017","DEMATEL; Indian context; MCDM; Sustainable manufacturing practices","Agile manufacturing systems; Decision making; Industrial research; Sustainable development; Business environments; DEMATEL; Environmental concerns; Indian context; Manufacturing strategy; MCDM; Multi criteria decision making; Sustainable manufacturing; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027516600

Energy use, material use, and environmental damage are factors that influence military operations in both the short and the long term. In this paper, we examine the behavior of 81 military forces with regard to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainability reporting. Furthermore, the characteristics of militaries with a CSR/sustainability strategy are identified. By using hierarchical cluster analysis and exploratory factor analysis, we locate characteristics of militaries with medium or strong connections to sustainable behavior. The results of the analysis demonstrate which militaries are likely to engage in improvements with regards to CSR and sustainability, particularly in relation to the environment. The findings of this paper demonstrate which militaries have a CSR or sustainability strategy and what the perceived benefits of such strategies are. Furthermore, we have identified militaries that are likely to implement such strategies in the future. Our findings indicate that countries with a strong regulatory environment, high Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, and medium to low military expenditures per capita seem to favor CSR and sustainability awareness within their militaries. For those countries, military CSR and sustainability strategies can demonstrate win-win situations, mainly due to lower energy and material costs on the one hand and reduced environmental impact on the other. However, countries with high military expenditures per capita but low GDP per capita and a loose regulatory environment seem to lack any CSR or sustainability commitment within their militaries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate social responsibility; Defence; Environmental strategy; Militaries; Sustainable operations","Cluster analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Factor analysis; Hierarchical systems; Military operations; Network security; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Defence; Environmental strategy; Militaries; Sustainable operations; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027515191

Large discrepancies in the deformation trajectories of open sections (curvilinear paths) and hollow sections (linear paths) were observed from the comparison of simulation runs.

Comparing certified guides’ job-crafting practices, we learn that guides are alike across the three countries, and they perceive themselves as natural-born who engage in self-actualization. They thrive on connecting with tourists, whom they empower or enlighten, as they craft idealistic or social objectives. At the same time, the guides work in individual workspaces, and they adapt to a competitive labour market, by assuming extra tasks and working for free or below tariffs, while they engage in fierce competition particularly with newcomers in order to make themselves employable. However, the study also indicates that organizational structures such as guide associations, which act as brokers to the market, may take the brunt of the individual competition in regard to the employers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Certified guides; employability; job crafting; labour market; working life","competition (economics); employment; guideline; labor market; tourism; Denmark; France; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021051221

The outcomes of changes in the size of public organizations have been relatively widely studied; however, much less is known about the internal processes through which these outcomes are actually achieved. This article explores whether changes in organizational size affect public management. As endogeneity is an inherent problem when studying outcomes of organizational size, we apply a quasi-experimental design in order to establish the causal linkage between size and different elements of public management. We use unique survey data collected before and after a large reform that changed the size of most Danish municipalities. The results suggest that public management related to daily operations is generic and not affected by size, whereas public management related to overall tasks such as creating a vision, servicing the mayor, and maintaining external relations is positively affected by size changes.

While management concepts such as business process reengineering (BPR), lean manufacturing and stage gate models have been subject to study and debate, key concerns centre on outcomes (or the lack thereof) and the translation of concepts as they are spread and adopted. However, their role in shaping actual organizational change is poorly understood. Very little has been said about how management concepts are used in organizations, and what managers actually do with them. In this paper, we argue that the effectiveness of management concepts would benefit from being understood as part of a network of configurators for organizational change. To this end, we analyse two empirical cases of management concept implementation (i.e. BPR and the 80/20 Pareto principle) and how the concepts configured change in mutual learning processes characterized by conflict, trial and error.

DLA is an activity-based concept, which is defined as employees’ active participation in leadership tasks. By combining a descriptive and a normative approach DLA has the potential of real employee empowerment. It can protect from arbitrary managerial power and lead to employees’ personal development through sharing organizational resources, influencing leadership activities and joint decision making in companies. The study examines individually perceived autonomy as an antecedent and employees’ occupational self-efficacy as an outcome of DLA over time. Furthermore, the study tests the mediating role of DLA on the autonomy – self-efficacy relationship. The two-wave study applied an online survey in a Danish municipality with a time lag of seven months. We used regression analyses for testing the cross-sectional as well as cross-lagged relationships and an autoregressive model for analyzing the half-longitudinal mediation. The results revealed a significant positive effect of DLA on employees’ occupational self-efficacy cross-sectionally at Time 1 (n = 117) and Time 2 (n = 67), as well as cross-lagged (n = 67). The cross-sectional and cross-lagged findings also support a significant positive impact of autonomy on DLA. However, DLA only mediated the autonomy–self-efficacy relationship cross-sectionally, but not over time. Computed alternative causal models corroborate the proposed direction of our hypothesized relationships. These results provide first evidence that structural features such as autonomy are timely prior to action-related behavior (DLA), and that participating in leadership tasks enhances employees’ occupational self-efficacy. © 2017, The Author(s).","Collective leadership; Distributed leadership agency; Individual autonomy; Occupational self-efficacy; Two-wave mediation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066259019

The study contributes in three ways to the ongoing effort to apply Bourdieu's theories to contemporary professional service work. First, it sheds light on the agency of individual practitioners in manifesting habitus, including the avoidance of certain behaviors in interactions with clients and peers. Second, it looks in greater depth at the process of acquiring habitus through work experiences, particularly among those who come to the profession without a suitable primary habitus; the findings suggest that having a fragmented habitus can constitute a strategic advantage for some practitioners. Third, the study sheds light on ways habitus affects client service; contrary to the trend in other professions, wealth managers' ability to enhance clients' cultural capital is often more highly valued than increasing their economic capital. These novel contributions are offered through analysis of a broadly global dataset, incorporating original interview data with 65 practitioners in 18 countries. This forms the basis for new insights on 'global habitus' in trans-national professional work - a topic of current scholarly debate. © 2017 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

It considers this communal aspect as a form of digital biosociality and links the discussion to debates on 'data philanthropy'.

Citizens' evaluation of performance information will, therefore, tend to be guided by reference points. We test how reference points alter citizens' evaluation of organizational performance. In this article, drawing on Herbert Simon, we test how citizens use historical (internal) and social (external) reference points when making relative comparisons: how important is current performance relative to past performance? And how important is current performance relative to the performance of other organizations? Two experiments are embedded within a large nationally representative sample of citizens (n = 3,443). The experiments assign historical and social reference points for performance data on education and unemployment to citizens. We find that citizens' performance evaluation is fundamentally a relative process. Interestingly, we show that social reference points are almost twice as important in citizens' evaluations as historical reference points. We find some evidence of a negativity bias in citizens' relative evaluations. The strong social reference point effects have implications for studying citizens' response to performance and how managers can frame and manipulate external performance data. © The Author 2017.

How are processions and pilgrimages related to the dominant imagination of old age as a period of fatigue and gray hair, suffering and loneliness, retirement and rest - and of waiting: waiting for a call from a loved one, waiting for the visit of a good companion, or, finally, expecting the end of life? This study is based on interviews with people from different countries, cultures, and religions. They show that a pilgrimage can push the elderly to do physical activities of some importance that are at the same time related to some sort of religious motivation. The pilgrim's walking in itself, as well as the achievement of its goal, helps people to reconsider their quality of life and active behavior. Elderly people also experience their independence, which perhaps was considered to be lost, with a pilgrimage, giving a new meaning to their aging. In light of these activities, old age becomes a period not just of physical and mental decay, but of self-discovery. It becomes an age that allows one to do something that one has not done during one's youth. And pilgrimages give people time to discover themselves - they have the chance to work on their own personality and social identity. This contributes to the understanding of their health and of their quality of life in a deeper sense. © 2017 Henning Eichberg et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2017.","aging; health; movement; religion; spirituality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032992186

Identifying significant limitations to the incorporation of feminist theory in these literatures, we discuss how feminist scholarship relating to behavior (through psychology and related fields), organizations (through feminist organization studies), and economics (through feminist economics) could be integrated.

This approach involves exploring existing studies with attention to theoretical boundaries, units of analysis, sources of data, study contexts, and definitions and the operationalization of constructs, as well as research methods, with the goal of refining or revising existing theory. This new paradigm will push supply chain management research to the frontier of current methodological standards and build a foundation for improving the contribution of future SLRs in the supply chain and adjacent management disciplines. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bias; guidelines; literature review; methodology; paradigm",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031736208

Lead users are valuable for suppliers because they are active in co-developing products and foreshadowing market needs. Big-science organizations represent a special breed of co-developers, as their demands are not necessarily the avant-garde of a coming market. Yet, they may provide a valuable test bed for suppliers because they are pushing the boundaries of technological capacities and, thus, challenging suppliers' talents. They are also prestigious collaboration partners that help producers to be acknowledged as being at the forefront of technology. They are often deeply engaged in their suppliers' manufacturing and development activities, which is seen as a characteristic of the customer-active paradigm upon which the lead-user notion builds. This paper investigates whether and how interacting with the European Organization for Nuclear Research concerning their development needs may contribute to suppliers' innovation. We ask the question: What characterizes interactions with big-science organizations as a type of lead user, and how do these characteristics impact the potential innovation benefits accruing to the suppliers? © SAGE Publications.","Big science; CERN; innovation; interaction; lead user; technology transfer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030764022

The approach is used to identify brand association networks, which contain information on how the brand and its associations are interconnected in consumers' minds. An essential contribution of the approach is that it provides a set of rules for how to aggregate individual brand association network data into a consensus map. Although BCM's aggregation rules are relatively straightforward and easy to use, the aggregation mechanism still has methodological and practical drawbacks. In this paper, we develop a new aggregation mechanism for individual brand association network data based on a critical assessment of the original aggregation rules.

New Public Management reforms from the 1980s onward viewed strategic entrepreneurial leadership and public–private competition as key drivers of public innovation. By contrast, the current wave of New Public Governance reforms perceives collaboration between relevant and affected actors from the public and private sector as the primary vehicle of public innovation, and tends to see governance networks as potential arenas for collaborative innovation. The new focus on collaborative innovation in networks poses a fundamental challenge for public managers, elected politicians, and others aiming to metagovern governance networks. Hence, we claim that a specific metagovernance strategy is needed when the purpose of governance networks is to stimulate efficiency, effectiveness, and democratic legitimacy through innovation rather than incremental improvements. The article aims to sketch out the contours of such a strategy by comparing it with more traditional metagovernance strategies.

However, extant research offers mixed findings regarding the effects of a brand alliance on its partner brands (i.e., spillover effects). In response, this study separates spillover effects into the effects of the alliance product on the partner brands (brand alliance effects) and the effects between partner brands (brand contrast effects), while also noting the potential moderating impact of perceived attitude- and product-based fit between partner brands on resulting spillover effects. Two experimental studies consistently reveal the existence of brand contrast effects; furthermore, the partner brand’s attitude-based fit reduces undesired brand contrast effects and positively moderates spillover effects in brand alliances, whereas product-based fit does not. Therefore, a third study identifies relevant drivers of partner brand’s attitude-based fit for different brand alliances (i.e., co-branding, ingredient branding, and joint advertising). The findings have notable implications for the design and management of brand alliances. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Attitude-based partner fit; Brand alliances; Brand contrast effects; Brand management; Product-based partner fit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029690179

Our findings reveal that sponsorship terminations have a negative effect on sponsors’ brand images—particularly early terminations that occur before the end of a contract—because consumers perceive these sponsorship terminations as unfair. The results also suggest that a termination is particularly harmful for the sponsor’s perceived fairness if the sponsor is powerful and if the termination decision is under the sponsor’s control. Further, the termination effect is particularly strong for firms that consumers trust. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Fairness; Locus of control; Power balance; Sponsorship; Sponsorship termination; Trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029671868

We analyze the relationship between the timing of college enrollment, educational outcomes, and the timing of family formation decisions in early adulthood. We use variation in college admission requirements to shed light on this issue. We employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the effects of being above the admission requirement for one's preferred college program on college enrollment decisions and the timing of family formation. Based on the analysis on enrollment and auxiliary analyses on labor market participation and earnings, we find that being above the admission requirement mainly affects the timing of college enrollment and not the college-going decision. Being above the admission requirement speeds up college enrollment, college completion and labor market entry. We find that being above the admission requirement has substantial effects on the timing of family formation, for example being above the admission requirement increases the number of children 8 years after year of application by about 0.1 corresponding to an increase of about 40 percent. Our results suggest that career postponements such as delays in the educational system can have large effects on family decision-making. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Career interruptions; Delayed college enrollment; Education policy; Fertility; Regression discontinuity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029537435

This article investigates general patterns in the sequence of adoption of organic products based on a major Danish retailer's panel scanner data. All registered transactions over 20 months from 8,704 randomly selected customers with a loyalty card are analyzed using a hidden Markov model, capturing the dynamics in consumers' purchases. The model identifies latent states representing identifiable, accessible, and actionable dynamic customer segments, and captures the movements between states or segments. A pattern emerges that is consistent with the theory of behavioral spillover and inconsistent with the theory of moral licensing, including a tendency to buy organic products in an increasing number of product categories over time. The order in which organic products are adopted is inversely related to the behavioral costs of adopting them. The employed approach provides a firm basis for personalized communication aiming to increase cross-selling of organic products, increase the sale of less popular organic products, and accelerate movements from segments buying few organic products to segments buying organic more consistently. © The Author 2017.

This study proposes a new classification system for trees outside forest elements based on the shape and size of the patches and their location in fields. Using this system, the study evaluates the spatial-temporal dynamics of different subcategories of trees outside forests in context with land cover changes of the Czech Republic. The analysis is based on the re-evaluation of change trajectories of individual landscape elements. Historical black and white aerial photographs from 1953 and colour orthophoto maps from 2014 were used as data sources. Although the results show an increased area of trees outside forests, lost and recent elements exceed persistent elements in all subcategories. Regardless of subcategory, most of the lost elements were replaced by forest and the majority of recent elements were created at the expanse of arable land or grasslands. Most of the patches of persistent elements got larger due to spontaneous succession during the study period. Riparian vegetation was found to be the most stable category of trees outside forest. Reasons underlaying the documented changes are discussed based on the existing literature. In general, the dynamics of trees outside forests are linked to changes in the fine-grained microstructure of historical landscapes. The applied method enables us to analyse spatio-temporal changes on the level of individual elements, which allows for monitoring of changes in landscape processes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Change trajectories; Habitat continuity; Land cover history; Trees outside forests","aerial photograph; environmental monitoring; forest; land cover; landscape change; landscape history; orthophoto; patch dynamics; spatiotemporal analysis; tree; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029359838

The aim is to allocate some inputs among decision making units (DMUs) in such way that their cost efficiencies improve or stay unchanged after RA. We formulate a multi-objective linear programming problem using two different strategies. First, we propose an RA model which keeps the cost efficiencies of units unchanged. This is done assuming fixed technical and allocative efficiencies. The approach is based on the assumption that the decision maker (DM) may not have big changes in the structure of DMUs within a short term. The second strategy does not impose any restrictions on technical and allocative efficiencies.

To do so, it draws from concepts in innovation studies, sociotechnical transitions, management science, organizational studies, and sociology. The study expands upon the notion of “fit-stretch”, which explains how innovations can move from an initial “fit” (with existing user practices, discourses, technical form) to a subsequent “stretch” (as the technology further develops, new functionalities are opened up, etc.) in the process of long-term transitions. It also draws from the “dialectical issue life cycle model” or “triple embeddedness framework” to explain the process whereby incumbent industry actors can introduce defensive innovations to “contain” a new niche from expanding. It lastly incorporates elements from design-driven innovation and organizational learning related to schemas and scripts, concepts that illustrate the vision-dependent and discursive elements of the innovation process. It uses the case study of Better Place to test and build upon these concepts. With a market valuation of more than $2 billion, Better Place was poised to become one of the most innovative companies in the electric mobility market. Yet after operating for five years it declared bankruptcy and saw its assets sold off for less than $500,000. We suggest here that Better Place failed because it “stretched” to the point that it “broke;” that it provoked a defensive response from both old automotive manufacturers (such as General Motors) and new ones (such as Tesla); and that the fantastic nature of its visionary scripts convinced its investors and promoters to unrealistically raise expectations and downplay persistent risks. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Electric vehicles; Energy transitions; Fit-stretch; Sociotechnical systems","Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Investments; Management science; Automotive manufacturers; Design-driven innovations; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Energy transitions; Organizational learning; Participant observations; Socio-technical transitions; Sociotechnical systems; Innovation; bankruptcy; electric vehicle; industrial performance; innovation; life cycle analysis; research work; technological change; transportation infrastructure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021671506

One potential way to specifically addressing efficiency targets is to outsource parts of the purchasing process. While outsourcing remains one of the most prevalent business practices in various areas, many businesses fail to realize the benefits anticipated from their outsourcing initiatives. Research reports that one major reason for these outsourcing challenges lies in the design of the focal organization. In this paper, we take an organization design view to outsourcing in the PSM context. Based on a multi-year case study from 2010 to 2013 at a global chemical and pharmaceutical company, we elaborate how the organizational design of the PSM function relates to outsourcing opportunities in order to increase efficiency and effectiveness by allocating internal resources to more value-adding activities. The case illustrates how an activity-based organizational design of PSM can support outsourcing of some parts of the purchasing process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Organizational design; Outsourcing; Purchasing and Supply Management; Purchasing organization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020935024

I present a dynamic stochastic model of the labor market that integrates two main features: search frictions and trade unions. Because of search frictions, each job match yields an economic surplus that is shared between the worker and the firm. Therefore, I can decompose the volatility of wages into two components: the volatility of the match surplus and the volatility of the worker share of the surplus. Starting from the unions' objective function, I show that under collective wage bargaining, the worker share is endogenous and counter-cyclical. Consequently, when the economy is hit by a shock, the dynamics of the worker share partially counteract the dynamics of the match surplus, and this mechanism delivers endogenous wage rigidity. The model thus offers new insights into two business cycle features: the union wage premium fluctuates counter-cyclically, and employment is more cyclical but less persistent when wages are collectively bargained. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cycles; Search and matching; Trade unions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020273482

We show that a mix of the taxes—or a unit tax alone if we compare one or the other of the taxes—is sometimes welfare superior on account of consumer-price and tax revenue effects. A practical implication of our findings is that pass-through rates are only sometimes useful guides for policy.

We match survey data of local elected officials in Denmark with individual partisan variables and objective performance data about the schools they oversee. We provide evidence that partisan beliefs matter, with conservative elected officials more willing to pursue a logic of individualized responsibility. We also find that elected officials are more likely to assume that bureaucratic leaders determine organizational outcomes where performance is very high or low, a leadership attribution heuristic previously established in private sector studies.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Companies are increasingly encouraged to frame their sustainability activities and communication around ecological limits, as captured by concepts such as planetary boundaries, climate tipping points or regenerative capacity. Ecological limits may serve as scientific basis for defining environmental sustainability targets at the company level and, moreover, inspire companies to align their product portfolios with emerging societal needs related to sustainable transformations. Although corporate environmental reporting is widely researched, little attention has, hitherto, been given to company use of the ecological limits concepts in stakeholder communication. This study presents a comprehensive review of references made to ecological limits in corporate responsibility (CR) reports in 2000–2014. An exhaustive list of terms related to ecological limits was developed and used to search the CorporateRegister database, which contained approximately 40,000 CR reports from this time period. For every identified reference, we analyzed the context in which the ecological limit term was used in the CR report. We found a 10-fold increase in the number of references made to ecological limits in CR reports during the period 2000–2014. The number of CR reports published in this time period has also increased at a similar rate. Hence, the proportion of companies referring to ecological limits in their CR reports has over the years remained stable; roughly 5%. The most commonly invoked ecological limits were related to climate change and references to “2°C” were by far the most frequent. The vast majority of companies referring to ecological limits did so without specific references to ongoing or planned changes in their activities as a consequence of recognizing these limits. Only a small percentage, predominately high-tech companies (31 in total), explicitly used ecological limits to define targets for resource consumption, emissions reductions and/or as a stated reason for adjusting their product portfolio. In defining targets for resource consumption or emissions, only a few CR reports dealt explicitly with the issue of allocating resource and emission rights within ecological limits amongst companies and other actors. A longitudinal study of three companies showed that these did not directly report progress towards planned changes based on ecological limits and offered explanations as to why some companies abandoned planned changes altogether. Our findings provide novel insights into the current use of the ecological limits concept by companies and may be useful for actors trying to motivate companies to align their activities with the finite nature of Earth's natural systems. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate environmental strategies; Environmental sustainability; Planetary boundaries; Science based targets; Sustainability criteria; Sustainable transformations","Climate change; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Corporate responsibility; Emissions reduction; Environmental reporting; Environmental strategy; Environmental sustainability; Regenerative capacity; Resource consumption; Sustainability criteria; Ecology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955564749

Overall, we find that this research has made some progress in the past. However, we also find this research stream to be characterized by three major shortcomings, namely low degree of novelty, missing investment in theory building, and a lack of research design and measurement options. To address these shortcomings, we suggest avenues for future research. Beyond that we also argue for a stronger emphasis on the strategic perspective of CS. In particular, we propose future research to take a step back and aim for an integration of the CS–CFP relationship into the strategic management literature. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate financial performance; Corporate sustainability; Literature review; Mediators; Moderators; Strategic corporate sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942051913

Power is a central, all-pervasive, but 'essentially contested concept' (Gallie in Proc Aristotelian Soc 56:167-198, 1955). The critical-theoretical paradigm provides particular insights for the study of power, because the way power is conceptualised is value-dependent, in that both its definition and use are tied to (usually implicit) value assumptions (Lukes in Power: A radical view. MacMillan Press, Basingstoke, 1974). Central to critical theory is making one's value assumptions explicit as part of the research process. The choice of a particular value system tends to empower and enfranchise certain persons or groups (and disem-power and disenfranchise others). To counteract these problems, critical theory is hermeneutic (i.e., trying to understand the socio-cultural world in which subjective meaning is located), emancipatory (i.e., changes individuals' self-consciousness, thereby changing society as a whole) and dialectical (i.e., transcending dualities like subject-object and fact and value). A way of engaging and empowering research participants is through the use of vignettes. Using vignettes in this context provides particular value, because they can act as stimulus to engender thought and action in line with the normative directives of critical theory. And vignettes have a particular relevance in business research, where their highly normative participative nature can involve and empower business stakeholders. They are likely to be more effective than most other techniques (Alexander and Becker in Public Opin Q 42 (1):93-104, 1978; Finch in Sociology 21(1):105-114, 1987). They potentially minimise the legal and ethical implications of observation studies (as also discussed in Marroun and Young in this volume). And they avoid potential Hawthorne effects in that vignettes identify knowledge, attitudes and opinions in any given situation and may not change the observed person's attitudes or behaviour as structured questioning or observation does (Wilson and While in J Interprof Care 12(1):79-86, 1998). This chapter thus describes the use of vignettes as a means to accomplish both practical and critical-theoretical research goals. After a clarifying definition of vignettes, their different intentions and purposes are described in a critical-theoretical perspective. The use of vignettes is then described, as are related evaluation criteria. Turned into methodological procedures, the use of vignettes will be illustrated by three examples, showing how theory, documents and preceding empirical research can be used as vignettes-or turned into vignettes-in doing critical business research. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055669647

By engaging more with such surprising moments, one can gain much richer insight when engaging with informants. With inspiration from theatre improvisation and forum theatre methods, we describe a range of methods that might serve as invitations to mutual spontaneity. Theatre improvisation induces fiction, such as playing imagined characters. By doing so, people respond with their real experience, which becomes a gateway to working with themes that might be difficult to approach otherwise. The methods, from almost two decades of the authors' experiences, have shown to stimulate sharing of perspectives between different stakeholders and also to work well with exploring power relations and shadow themes, meaning and conversation that go against formal ideologies. The methods invite reflexivity among all involved. The work with theatre improvisation methods is understood from a perspective of complex responsive processes of relating, in which the researcher is seen as one participant amongst others and from which the insights emerge as experience for the researcher. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055666517

This makes sense if the researcher belongs to the positivist paradigm, where a researcher favours a meta-analysis review (systematically and empirically reviewing quantitative studies), whereas a researcher belonging to the interpretivist paradigm will prefer to conduct meta-synthesis reviews (reviewing qualitative studies and their interpretations). For a critical realist, more approaches are available, with the main proviso that the reviews undertaken are done in a systematic and transparent way. This chapter focuses on the critical realist options and provides researchers with an overview of different types of reviews to choose from.

Because a paradigm consists of some ultimate presumptions (understood as philosophical hypothesis or normative theses), paradigms influence the way in which researchers understand problems and how researchers look at existing and available sets of research methods and knowledge in general. The powers of paradigms thus are substantial and should be noted by researchers to provide context for their reflections. The paradigms we depart from are inspired by the Arbnor and Bjerke (Methodology for creating business knowledge, SAGE Publications, Thousand Oaks, 2009) distinction between an analytical view (similar to positivism), a system view (similar to critical realism) and an actor view (similar to interpretism). To illustrate the transformation that neutral research methods go through, we consider an often-used method in business research, which researchers often become familiar with or have opinions about, which is the personal interview. The illustration of how the personal interview can be influenced by three different paradigms lays the foundation for a more nuanced understanding of how research methods in general can be used very differently depending on the paradigm researcher's departure. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055655673

Knowledge production can be separated into context of discovery (problem/domain definition and initial ideas) and context of justification (hypothesis testing and hypothesis improvement). The context of justification is much better understood by researchers than is the context of discovery. The concepts of induction and deduction are used in the context of justification but they cannot explain how new ideas are created. This chapter proposes the concept of abduction to address this. Abduction can be conceptualized as making guesses. In a theory building process there is a need to make guesses when a researcher makes observations which are surprising in that they depart from existing theory. Other researchers have used abduction to describe and understand theory building. This paper identifies anomalies in the existing frameworks and proposes further development of the framework of systematic combining of the theory and empirical world. This chapter argues that the concept of abduction can contribute to understand how theory is created in theory testing, theory development and theory creation, but focuses on theory building in both realist and an interpretive research. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055645173

Besides being fun, this provides several advantages over 'dry' conversation: Richness in detail, playful 'talking with hands', embodied empathy with partners, concrete thought experiments. I will demonstrate four techniques that employ tangible material to challenge interviewees to explain in depth their company's business model and even to further develop their own understanding of it. As a research method, tangible modelling can enhance interviews (Chap. 6), which aim to achieve deep knowledge of how the interviewees understand their situation. In particular, tangible business modelling supports focus group interviews, where participants investigate a shared topic. However, tangible business modelling also lends itself to action research endeavours. Tangible business modelling shows its strength in innovation workshops (Chap. 7) in which researchers engage companies in business model renewal, organisational change or business-relation development. In this chapter I will explain which types of research data this method provides and which research results they generate. Also, I will exemplify which changes the introduction of tangible materials into business interviews may stimulate in the business organisation. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055641000

Collaboration involves research participants working together to produce work meaningful to them and the methods presented are articulated in these terms. The other key component of the foundation is the importance of research designers articulating their conceptual assumptions. This enables better and more transparent research designs and interpretation of research findings.

Thus, one's paradigmatic stance needs to be clear as it influences on how research questions are formulated and methods are chosen and used.

Green biorefinery concepts might become the suitable solution for the production of organic protein-rich feeds from green crops. In this context, red clover, clover grass, alfalfa and oilseed radish were studied as possible feedstocks for the development of an organic biorefinery system in Northern Europe. For this purpose, the green crops were processed into a nitrogen-rich protein concentrate, a fiber-rich press cake, and a residual stream of soluble nutrients (brown juice). The process, which involved a novel protein refining technique using lactic acid fermentation, yielded between 6 and 13 kg of dry organic protein product per ton of fresh crop. The protein products of the different crops presented balanced amino acid composition compared to soybeans, which are commonly used in organic farming. Moreover, methionine contents between 7.8 and 9.1 g/kg DM were obtained in the protein products, which is more than the typical concentration found in animal feeds (5.2 g/kg DM in soybeans). This makes the organic protein product produced very promising as a feed ingredient for organic farming of monogastric animals in Europe. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Green crops; Monogastric animals; Organic farming; Protein feed","Agriculture; Amino acids; Animals; Bioconversion; Crops; Fermentation; Lactic acid; Refining; Amino acid compositions; Biorefineries; Green biorefinery; Lactic acid fermentation; Monogastric animals; Organic farming; Protein concentrates; Suitable solutions; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027846811

This is done using the case study of a representative Danish single family home over the service life of the building. This case study uses both the established and the coupled MCDA assessment methods to quantify and assess the balance of impacts between the production of mineral wool insulation versus the production of space heat. The use of TOPSIS method for calculating single scores is proposed as an alternative to the ReCiPe single score impact assessment method. Based on the single score impact values obtained from both of these methods, various insulation levels are ranked to determine an ideal insulation level and gauge the effectiveness of environmental impact reduction measures in current Danish building regulations. Using a comparison of the results from the two methods, a preferred choice of impact assessment method is determined. The findings show that if the midpoint impacts for a particular scenario are strongly correlated with a climate change impact indicator, it does not matter which impact assessment is applied. However, for the scenarios where other impact categories vary inversely or independently from the climate change impact indicator, such as with renewable energy production, there is need for a more unconventional method, such as the TOPSIS method, for calculating single score impacts. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Building material; Life cycle assessment; Mineral wool insulation; Multiple criteria decision making","Building codes; Building materials; Climate change; Condition monitoring; Decision making; Decision theory; Electric insulating materials; Environmental regulations; Insulation; Life cycle; Mineral wool; Operations research; Reliability analysis; Wool; Yarn; Building insulations; Building regulations; Climate change impact; Dynamic assessment; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multiple criteria decision analysis; Multiple criteria decision making; Renewable energies; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024127448

Circular Economy (CE), which established on the basis of “3R principals”, was adopted by the Chinese authorities as a national development strategy to reduce resource consumption and mitigate environmental pollution. After more than ten years’ implementation of CE strategy, it is of vital importance to investigate the progresses and current status of CE development in China, especially in those China's megacities from both spatial and temporal perspectives, so as to identify the barriers of local CE development in megacities. To achieve such an objective, this study assesses the CE development in China's four megacities during the last ten years by using one unified indicator system. Results indicate that significant disparities exist among China's four megacities regarding both CE development index trajectory and CE internal structure. While all four megacities had significantly improved their CE development since 2005, megacities located in eastern China, namely Beijing and Shanghai, had better CE development performances than megacities from western China, namely Urumqi and Chongqing. With respect to the composition of CE development index, Beijing and Urumqi were doing better on balancing the development of CE's four aspects, namely, resource consumption intensity (RCI), waste emission intensity (WEI), waste recycling and utilization rate (WRUR) and waste disposal level (WDL). In contrast, CE development in Chongqing and Shanghai was primarily attributed to the three aspects of RCI, WEI and WDL, and the WRUR aspects had contributed little to their CE development during the last ten years, indicating an unbalanced CE development status. Additional, Shanghai and Chongqing increased faster on annual average CE development index, and the growth of CE development index of Urumqi was the slowest among the four megacities. In order to promote the CE development performance in China's four megacities, several measures have been proposed, including providing financial and technological support to Urumqi and Chongqing, promoting the recycling of reclaimed wastewater in Chongqing and Shanghai, supporting the application of integrated waste management, as well as encouraging the participation of local residents. This study could provide valuable reference for countries and regions that adopt CE as their development mode. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Circular economy; Entropy; Indicator","Entropy; Indicators (instruments); Planning; Pollution; Recycling; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Waste management; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; China; Circular economy; Comparative assessment; Development performance; Environmental pollutions; Integrated waste management; National development; Technological supports; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024105515

Increasing rates of pollution and environmental calamities caused by industrial production have urged several researchers and industry experts to work on Sustainable Production and Consumption issues within the context of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). This paper comprehensively covers the exponential growth of the topic through an evolutionary lens. This article attempts to understand the evolution of sustainability issues by analysing trends across industries, economies, and through the use of various methodologies. A comprehensive thematic analysis was performed on 1068 filtered articles from 2000 to 2015, highlighting the development and importance of the body of knowledge. The study proposes a conceptual framework to classify various factors along the triple bottom line pillars of sustainability issues in the context of supply chains. An in-depth study is conducted on 190 articles covering all pillars of sustainability (as per the proposed conceptual framework) on SSCM. We observe that studies focusing on all three dimensions of sustainability are comparatively scarce. More focus on industry-specific studies is required because problems addressing industries that are serious polluters, especially those in emerging economies, remains largely unaddressed. It is observed that the studies addressing social issues are scarce, and more focus is required on the measurement of social impacts along the supply chain. Finally, we propose future avenues to extend research on the SSCM domain while keeping in mind the need to address industry specific and economy specific problems from the triple bottom line perspective. © 2017","Green supply chain management; Literature review; Sustainability; Sustainable operations; Sustainable supply chain management; Thematic analysis","Hierarchical systems; Industrial economics; Sustainable development; Green supply chain management; Literature reviews; Sustainable operations; Sustainable supply chains; Thematic analysis; Supply chain management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024094913

Findings: The findings reveal challenges as well as opportunities for innovation collaboration between larger enterprises and SMEs to contribute to the innovation and competitiveness of the offshore wind farm sector. A glass ceiling is revealed for demand-driven positions if the SME does not possess rare and specific valuable knowledge. There are opportunities revealed in general for supplier-driven positions if SME suppliers can collaborate and develop interesting solutions for larger enterprises.

Design/methodology/approach: Through an embedded single-case study, the contextual conditions of SNEI within the relatively immature offshore wind energy industry are investigated. Findings: The national system of innovation only affects product innovation within the industry. Process innovation, which is needed to make the industry grow and mature, seems lesser supported. Different levels of maturity exist among the actors within the industry, which creates barriers for SNEI. To help the offshore wind industry grow, the educational and research system can promote integration of companies by helping the actors to design best practices and manage their business processes according to some generic goals and practices. Additionally, the political system must provide clearer intentions for a sustainable future. Practical implications: This paper provides insights into how SNEI can be applied within the Danish offshore wind industry to foster competitive advantages against energy recovered based on fossil fuels.

This truth may not hold from a single-company perspective. The companies’ physical operation networks show that container carriers operate differently and follow different paths in their internationalisation development. Additionally, the degree of internationalisation, measured on the basis of sea-oriented operations, differs from that measured according to land-oriented front-end marketing and sales activities. The purpose of this study is to further examine the internationalisation patterns of shipping lines. Design/methodology/approach: An examination of the front-end activities and the structures of leading container-shipping companies is conducted. The sales office networks of the sector’s 20 largest companies worldwide (by twenty-foot equivalent unit capacity) are analysed as key indicators. The numbers of sales offices are measured by analysing the websites of the sample (20 companies), as well as annual reports and other publicly available data sources. Findings: The findings show that not all shipping companies are international, by virtue of the industry. While it is difficult to observe differences in the overall patterns of the sales networks at a macro level, some companies differ in their activities. The data set also shows that market share and total capacity are not necessarily good indicators of a carrier’s worldwide presence. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on secondary data. Other important transactional and market-oriented considerations should be examined before drawing conclusions about the internationalisation of container-shipping companies and of the industry.

As part of these efforts, a dedicated task force focused on addressing several LCIA cross-cutting issues as aspects spanning several impact categories, including spatiotemporal aspects, reference states, normalization and weighting, and uncertainty assessment. Here, findings of the cross-cutting issues task force are presented along with an update of the existing UNEP-SETAC LCIA emission-to-damage framework. Specific recommendations are provided with respect to metrics for human health (Disability Adjusted Life Years, DALY) and ecosystem quality (Potentially Disappeared Fraction of species, PDF). Additionally, we stress the importance of transparent reporting of characterization models, reference states, and assumptions, in order to facilitate cross-comparison between chosen methods and indicators. We recommend developing spatially regionalized characterization models, whenever the nature of impacts shows spatial variability and related spatial data are available. Standard formats should be used for reporting spatially differentiated models, and choices regarding spatiotemporal scales should be clearly communicated. For normalization, we recommend using external normalization references. Over the next two years, the task force will continue its effort with a focus on providing guidance for LCA practitioners on how to use the UNEP-SETAC LCIA framework as well as for method developers on how to consistently extend and further improve this framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Characterization framework; Ecosystem quality; Human health; Life cycle impact assessment; Natural resources; Uncertainty assessment","Characterization; Ecology; Ecosystems; Natural resources; Disability adjusted life years; Environmental life cycle; Human health; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Scientific knowledge; Spatio-temporal scale; Uncertainty assessment; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025451582

Discussion about gender issues in the field of corporate responsibility has focused on workplace issues and corporate boards, which are important areas of work. However, the great benefit of exploring gender issues through a responsible business lens is that this requires us to also examine the wider gender impacts of business in the marketplace - for example, with regard to suppliers, supply chains, and consumers, and with respect to the communities where business operates, and the wider ecological environment - indeed throughout corporate value chains.Through contributions from practitioners in business and civil society, as well as academia, this book broadens the agenda, opening the field to new voices, and facilitates dialogue among and between practitioners and researchers. Contributions within the edited collection elucidate current practice, bring new perspectives, and help us to expand the field of responsible business with regard to gender equality, and beyond. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

The Afghan context is conceptualized as an Area of Limited Statehood, indicating the inability of the Afghan state to deliver basic services required for markets to function in a least-developed nation. The chapter argues that pressures from ""market anarchy"" and ""traditional communities"" thereby prevail, and trigger the corporations to actively engage in CSR practices either as ""victim of"" or ""solution to"" the lack of development. Such CSR practices mainly target wider society beneficiaries, and have to some extent developmental impact due to urgent and widespread need for development in Afghanistan. However, the chapter concludes that the current business-driven CSR agenda has inherent limitations and fails to grasp the immense developmental potential offered by mobile technology for the poor in contexts such as Afghanistan. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

This chapter employs CSR frameworks in relation to consultation and consent principles to discuss the conflicting political and economic elite groups' perspectives on the one hand and those of indigenous populations on the other in Mexico. This study examines an ecological and environmentally friendly mega-wind energy project that has led two multinational corporations (MNCs) into a conflict with indigenous people. The discussion will be framed on indigenous communities who are challenged by questionable institutional (legal systems) arrangements from political and economic elite groups.

It is a realistic look at performance management, the evidence movement, and the demand barriers that so often block the role evaluators can play in organizational learning and decision-making. International case studies and lessons are included that both explain success-oriented methods and share insightful lessons from the real world.

Two avenues for rethinking CSR in developing countries are outlined; (a) a governance approach, and (b) an application of the term ""responsible business practices"". The developmental implication is based on the governance structures triggering CSR in each context. We need to differentiate between strong and weak states and understand the ways that (lack of) states can influence CSR in developing countries. ""Responsible business practices"" are explored as useful among developing country SMEs operating in more informal ways based on local values and norms in contrast to the large firm, formalized and normative CSR concept.

Virtual experimentation and simulation can enable companies to innovate more effectively and efficiently and build competitive advantage. However, the development and implementation of virtual capabilities is not simple and not without pitfalls; some companies have struggled to fully leverage these technologies. What is currently missing from the knowledge landscape is a common measure of where an organization stands with regard to its virtual capabilities and of what parameters drive effective use of virtual experimentation and simulation. To fill this gap, we offer a preliminary maturity matrix, a framework that can be used to judge an organization’s maturity and effectiveness in developing and deploying virtual experimentation and simulation capabilities.

In this paper, we explore these developments by discussing findings from a research project that investigated how publically funded scientists perceived and practiced responsibility. We show that, though the scientists in this study mostly viewed policy discourses such as Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) as irrelevant to them, they articulated and practiced a range of ‘bottom-up’ responsibilities, including for producing sound science, taking care of employees, creating ‘impact’ and carrying out publically legitimate science. The practice of these responsibilities was often shaped by wider dynamics in the governance of knowledge production, such as academic capitalism and the marketisation of universities. Based on these findings, we suggest that RRI scholarship should, first, work to develop a shared language of responsibility with scientists, and, second, more actively address the political context of contemporary scientific research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","academic capitalism; emerging technologies; responsibility; Responsible Research and Innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045137232

Now, desalination of seawater and wastewater reuse for both non-potable and potable water supply have become common practice in many places. LCA has been used to assess the potentials and reveal hotspots among the possible technologies and scenarios for water supplies of the future. LCA studies have been used to support decisions in the planning of urban water systems and some important findings include documentation of reduced environmental impact from desalination of brackish water over sea water, the significant impacts from changed drinking water quality and reduced environmental burden from wastewater reuse instead of desalination. Some of the main challenges in conducting LCAs of water supply systems are their complexity and diversity, requiring very large data collection efforts, with multiple sources of information, many of them not public and requiring cooperation. Important for product and system LCAs with substantial water use, it is emphasized that standard life cycle inventory databases do not reflect the significant variance in environmental impacts of water supply across locations and technologies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037671467

The life cycle stages of chemical products, such as pharmaceuticals drugs or plant protection products, are discussed and differentiated into extraction of abiotic and biotic raw materials, chemical synthesis and processing, material processing, product manufacturing, professional or consumer product use, and finally end-of-life. LCA is discussed in relation to other chemicals management frameworks and concepts including risk assessment, green and sustainable chemistry, and chemical alternatives assessment. A large number of LCA studies focus on contrasting different feedstocks or chemical synthesis processes, thereby often conducting a cradle to (factory) gate assessment. While typically a large share of potential environmental impacts occurs during the early product life cycle stages, potential impacts related to chemicals that are found as ingredients or residues directly in products can be dominated by the product use stage. Finally, methodological challenges in LCA studies in relation to chemicals are discussed including the choice of functional unit, defining the system boundaries, quantifying emissions for many thousands of marketed chemicals, characterising emissions in terms of toxicity and other impacts, and finally interpreting LCA results. The chapter is relevant for LCA students and practitioners who wish to gain basic understanding of LCA studies of products or processes with chemicals as a key aspect. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037669065

Along with their central role and large diversity, these systems have been demonstrated to cause serious impacts on human health, ecosystems and natural resources. Over the past two decades, energy systems have thus been the focus of more than 1000 LCA studies, with the aim to identify and reduce these impacts. This chapter addresses LCA applications to energy systems for generation of electricity and heat. The chapter gives insight into the LCA practice related to such systems, offering a critical review of (i) central methodological aspects, including the definition of the goals and scopes of the studies, their coverage of the system life cycle and the environmental impacts, and (ii) key findings of the studies, particularly aimed at identifying environmental hotspots and impact patterns across different energy sources. Based on this literature review recommendations and guidelines are issued to LCA practitioners on key methodological aspects that are important for a proper conduct of LCA studies of energy systems and thus ensuring the reliability of the LCA results provided to decision- and policy-makers. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037663925

As fossil resources are limited, and the use of such resources is a major contributor to global warming and other environmental impacts, the potential of bio-products as substitutes for fossil-based products is receiving much attention. According to many LCA studies, bio-products are environmentally superior to fossil products in some life cycle impact categories, while the picture is often opposite in others. Bio-products is a highly diverse group of products and the environmental profile of bio-products relative to their fossil counterparts is case specific and to a high degree depending on the feedstock used. This illustrates the importance of conducting case specific LCAs for determining the environmental profile of bio-products relative to fossil ones, and emphasises the importance of including all relevant impact categories, in order to avoid problem shifting. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037645726

The dominating environmental concerns within this domain are indeed still potential aquatic eutrophication/oxygen depletion due to nutrient/organic matter emissions and potential health impacts due to spreading of pathogens. Anyway, the use of treatment for micro-pollutants is increasing and a paradigm shift is ongoing- wastewater is more and more considered as a resource of, e.g. energy, nutrients and even polymers, in the innovations going on. The focus of LCA studies addressing wastewater treatment have from the very first published cases, been on energy and resource consumption. In recent time, the use of characterisation has increased and besides global warming potential, especially eutrophication is in focus. Even the toxicity-related impact categories are nowadays included more often. Application of LCA for comparing avoided against induced impacts, and hereby identifying trade-offs when introducing new technology, is increasingly used. A typical functional unit is the treatment of one cubic metre of wastewater which should be well defined regarding composition. Depending on the goal and scope of the study, all life cycle stages have the potential of being significant, though disposal of infrastructure seems to be the least important for the impact profile in many cases. No inventory data and none of the conventional impact categories (except stratospheric ozone depletion if emission of N2O is excluded) should be ruled out; but eutrophication and ecotoxicity are in many cases among the dominating ones.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037638796

The life cycle of a food product is split into six stages: production and transportation of inputs to the farm, cultivation, processing, distribution, consumption and waste management. A large number of LCA studies focus on the two first stages in cradle-to-farm gate studies, as they are the stages where most impacts typically occur, due to animal husbandry and manure handling, production and use of fertilisers and the consumption of fuel to operate farm machinery. In the processing step, the raw agricultural product leaving the farm gate is converted to a food item that can be consumed by the user. Distribution includes transportation of the food product before and after processing. In the consumption stage, environmental impacts arise due to storage, preparation and waste of the food. In the waste management stage, food waste can be handled using a number of technologies, such as landfilling, incineration, composting or digestion. A number of case studies are looked at here where the life cycles of typical food products (meat, cheese, bread, tomatoes, etc.), and an entire diet are discussed. Other case studies deal with what LCA can conclude on the differences between conventional and organic farming, and the perceived advantages of local food items. Finally, methodological issues in agricultural LCA are discussed: the choice of functional unit, setting the boundary between technosphere and ecosphere, modelling flows of nutrients and pesticides, and the generally limited number of impact categories included in LCA studies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037637858

Life cycle assessment is able to include a wide range of environmental impacts but, due to data limitations, it is commonly applied with focus on the cradle-to-gate part of the nanoproducts life cycle, neglecting use and disposal of the products. These studies conclude that nanomaterials are more energy demanding and have an inferior environmental profile than conventionally used materials, but functional units of these comparisons need to consider the use stage benefits attained through nanomaterials.

This chapter explores the current state of LCA applied to two scales of human settlements; individual buildings and the built environment, where the built environment is understood as a collection of autonomous buildings along with the infrastructure and human activity between those buildings. The application of LCA to buildings has seen growing interest in recent years, partly as a result of the increased application of environmental certification to buildings. General findings are that the use stage of the building tends to dominate environmental impacts, though as buildings become increasingly energy efficient, life cycle impacts shift towards other stages. LCA of built environments has been a useful supplement to mass-based urban environmental assessments, highlighting the importance of embodied environmental impacts in imported goods and showing interesting trade-offs between dense urban living and the greater purchasing power of wealthy urbanites. LCAs of human settlements also face difficult challenges; the long use stage (often decades) introduces high uncertainty regarding the end-of-life stage; evolving electrical mixes throughout the use stage; gaps in consumption data at the city level. This chapter endeavours to elucidate the strengths, research needs and methodological shortcomings of LCA as applied to buildings and the built environment, showing that they can act as complimentary tools to help society's shift towards a sustainable future. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037631883

This chapter gives a brief summary of the history of LCA since then with a focus on the fields of methodological development, application, international harmonisation and standardisation, and dissemination. LCA had its early roots in packaging studies and focused mainly on energy use and a few emissions, spurring a largely un-coordinated method development in the US and Northern Europe. Studies were primarily done for companies, who used them internally and made little communication to stakeholders. After a silent period in the 1970s, the 1980s and 1990s saw an increase in methodological development and international collaboration and coordination in the scientific community and method development increasingly took place in universities. With the consolidation of the methodological basis, application of LCA widened to encompass a rapidly increasing range of products and systems with studies commissioned or performed by both industry and governments, and results were increasingly communicated through academic papers and industry and government reports. To this day, methodological development has continued, and increasing attention has been given to international scientific consensus building on central parts of the LCA methodology, and standardisation of LCA and related approaches. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037631310

In this chapter, we introduce remediation technologies and associated environmental impacts, present an overview of literature findings on LCA applied to remediation technologies and present methodological issues to consider when conducting LCAs within the area. Within the field of contaminated site remediation, a terminology distinguishing three types of environmental impacts: primary, secondary and tertiary, is often applied. Primary impacts are the site-related impacts due to the contamination in the ground, secondary impacts are the impacts related to clean-up of the site, and tertiary impacts are the impacts associated with the future use of the site. The major methodological issues to consider when conducting LCA are: (i) defining a functional unit that considers time frame and efficiency of remediation, which are important for assessment or primary impacts; (ii) robust assessment of primary impacts using site-specific fate and exposure models; (iii) weighting of primary and secondary (or tertiary) impacts to evaluate trade-offs between life cycle impacts from remediation and reduced pressure locally; and (iv) comparison with a no action scenario to determine whether there is a net environmental benefit from remediation. Overall, LCA is an important tool for the assessment of the secondary environmental impacts of remediation, and occasionally it has also been used to assess primary and tertiary impacts. In order to obtain robust decisions for the management of contaminated sites, the combination of LCA with other tools is necessary, including multi-criteria decision analysis tools, site-specific fate and exposure models and consideration of stakeholders' views. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037626833

The relevance of environmental protection for dimensions 2 and 4 is then demonstrated, and the strategy of LCA to achieving environmental protection, namely to guide the reduction of environmental impacts per delivery of a function, is explained. The attempt to broaden the scope of LCA, beyond environmental protection, by so-called life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is outlined. Finally, the limitations of LCA in guiding a sustainable development are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037626098

This chapter begins by demonstrating how the use of LCA in the late 2000s led to a drastic shift in the dominant perception that biofuels were ""green"", ""sustainable"" or ""carbon neutral"", which led to a change in biofuel policies. This is followed by a grouping of the LCA characteristics into four headlines and an explanation of these: (1) takes a life cycle perspective, (2) covers a broad range of environmental issues, (3) is quantitative, (4) is based on science. From the insights of the LCA characteristics we then consider the strengths and limitations of LCA and end the chapter by listing 10 questions that LCA can answer and 3 that it cannot. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037625474

In documenting the three phases of the UNEP-SETAC Life Cycle Initiative, a conventional roadmap for global mainstreaming of LCA is drawn. However, the questioning by some South governments of the rationale and a North methodological bias of LCA draws attention to the significance of national and local contexts in developing countries.

It can form the economic pillar in a full life cycle sustainability assessment, but often system delimitations differ depending on the goal and scope of the study. To provide a profound understanding this chapter describes several approaches and terms, fundamental principles and different types of costs. A brief introduction is given to conventional LCC and societal LCC but the main focus is on environmental Life Cycle Costing (eLCC) as the LCC approach that is compatible with environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in terms of system delimitation. Differences are explained and addressed, and an overview is given of the main cost categories to consider from different user perspectives. As inventory data is often sensitive in financial analyses, a list of relevant databases is provided as well as guidance on how to collect data to overcome this hurdle. In an illustrative case study on window frames, the eLCC theory is applied and demonstrated with each step along the eLCC procedure described in detail.

The presence of uncertainties of different types and from numerous sources in LCA results is a fact, but managing them allows to quantify and improve the precision of a study and the robustness of its conclusions. LCA practice sometimes suffers from an imbalanced perception of uncertainties, justifying modelling choices and omissions. Identifying prevalent misconceptions around uncertainties in LCA is a central goal of this chapter, aiming to establish a positive approach focusing on the advantages of uncertainty management. The main objectives of this chapter are to learn how to deal with uncertainty in the context of LCA, how to quantify it, interpret and use it, and how to communicate it. The subject is approached more holistically than just focusing on relevant statistical methods or purely mathematical aspects. This chapter is neither a precise statistical method description, nor a philosophical essay about the concepts of uncertainty, knowledge and truth, although you will find a little bit of both. This chapter contains (1) an introduction of the essential terminology and concepts of relevance for LCA; (2) a discussion of main sources of uncertainty and how to quantify them; (3) a presentation of approaches to calculate uncertainty for the final results (propagation); (4) a discussion of how to use uncertainty information and how to take it into account in the interpretation of the results; and finally (5) a discussion of how to manage, communicate and present uncertainty information together with the LCA results. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037615343

This is followed by a comparison of C2C with eco-efficiency and LCA. Because of their important differences, we conclude that care should be taken when combing C2C and LCA, e.g. using LCA to evaluate products inspired by C2C. We then provide an in-depth analysis of the conflicts between C2C and LCA and offer solutions.

The environmental implications of choices involved in the modelling setup of waste management systems are increasingly in the spotlight, due to public health concerns and new legislation addressing the impacts from managing our waste. The application of LCA to solid waste management systems, sometimes called ""waste LCA"", is distinctive in that system boundaries are rigorously defined to exclude all life cycle stages except from the end-of-life. Moreover, specific methodological challenges arise when investigating waste systems, such as the allocation of impacts and the consideration of long-term emissions. The complexity of waste LCAs is mainly derived from the variability of the object under study (waste) which is made of different materials that may require different treatments. This chapter attempts to address these challenges by identifying common misconceptions and by providing methodological guidance for alleviating the associated uncertainty. Readers are also provided with the list of studies reviewed and key sources for reference to implement LCA on solid waste systems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037378912

This article analyzes how open-source politics is organized in the case of a radical political party in Denmark called The Alternative. Inspired by the literature on organizational space, the analysis explores how different organizational spaces configure the party’s process of policy development, thereby adding to our understanding of the relationship between organizational space and political organization. We analyze three different spaces constructed by The Alternative as techniques for practicing open-source politics and observe that physical and digital spaces create an oscillation between openness and closure. In turn, this oscillation produces a dialectical relationship between practices of imagination and affirmation. Curiously, it seems that physical spaces open up the political process, while digital spaces close it down by fixing meaning. Accordingly, we argue that open-source politics should not be equated with online politics but may be highly dependent on physical spaces. Furthermore, digital spaces may provide both closure and disconnection between a party’s universal body and its particular body. In conclusion, however, we propose that such a disconnection might be a precondition for success when institutionalizing radical politics, as it allows parties like The Alternative to maintain their universal appeal. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Affect; affordances; bodies in politics; digital media; imagination; materiality; open-source politics; organizational space; political organization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027977239

First, will an exploratory factor analysis of a Danish version of the Learning Transfer System Inventory (LTSI) result in a factor structure which is consistent with the original American LTSI factor structure? Second, does the mean score in the factor analysis vary in a statistically significant way across different types of education, suggesting that the LTSI may be more suitable a measure in some educational contexts than others? To answer these questions survey data from 411 students following four different types of formal education – adult vocational training, academy profession programs, diploma programs and master's degree programs – were analysed. Principal component analysis was used to answer research question one. Factorial ANOVA was used to answer question two. The analysis resulted in fewer factors than in the original American LTSI. The study also found that the mean score differs in a statistically significant way between the different types of education. Specifically, LTSI may be more suitable in measuring transfer systems and therefore promoting transfer in relation to short courses offering training in specific skills than in relation to long-term continuing education. © 2017 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027690089

The first evaluates self-selection (the probability that individuals apply) and the second focuses on the likelihood that applications are accepted by the bank. Findings show that discrimination is likely to appear when the applicant’s nationality is considered.

An increasing number of people are participating in sharing and exchanging information, knowledge, data and goods. As research addressing the so-called ‘sharing economy’ is still in its infancy, this article aims to shed light on it. To do this, a qualitative research approach comprising guided interviews with 14 companies from Germany, Austria and Switzerland provides detailed insights into different aspects of the sharing economy phenomenon. Our results make a direct contribution to sharing economy research, especially regarding the new business models of start-ups. Here, we find a clear difference between the relevance of economic and social orientation. The latter appears to be in higher demand among customers than entrepreneurs. The increasingly digitalized environment has led to a changed living situation characterized by urbanity, openness to new solutions, changed working situations and new mindsets. All of these aspects drive the sharing economy. The results of this paper are summarized in a framework highlighting the requirements, drivers and goals of the sharing economy.

Price increases cannot be effective if unnoticed, but little is known about young people’s alcohol price knowledge and sensitivity, as aggregate price sensitivity studies have produced ambiguous results. Applying individual data, this study examines young people’s knowledge of retail alcohol prices using two price memory tests. Results show that the majority holds fairly accurate reference prices, while a large segment intentionally checks in-store alcohol prices, though large variations exist across categories. Furthermore, logistic regressions revealed ‘purchased a special’ and ‘simple prices’ as determinants of alcohol price knowledge. The results suggest that alcohol tax increases must be significant to be effective when targeting young people. Otherwise, such increases go unnoticed and other policy instruments may perform better, not least when targeting the youngest, and thus most vulnerable group. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","alcohol intake; alcohol tax; macromarketing; price knowledge; retail context; young people",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027099639

After a decade of comparatively limited attention, the topic of narrative reporting has returned to the accounting research agenda, in part in association with integrated reporting and a growing interest in accounting for business models, as well as a resurgence of intellectual capital research. In the light of a continuing optimism that narrative reporting will eventually assume its rightful place within financial reporting, the paper reports and reflects upon the findings of a study of the outcome of the Danish Guideline Project in the decade following its conclusion in late 2002. This initiative placed a heavy emphasis on the extension of narrative reporting in its principal output, the Intellectual Capital Statement, still widely regarded as a highly promising intellectual capital reporting framework. Based on insights derived from the study, the paper identifies a number of major obstacles that confront the advocates of narrative disclosure practices, the persistence of which is rooted in the contestable jurisdiction that characterises the accountancy profession itself. © 2017","Business reporting; Danish Guideline Project; Integrated reporting; Intellectual capital; Intellectual capital statements; Narrative reporting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021778946

Analysis using a dynamic fixed effects model for a panel of 90 developing countries shows that nationwide political conflict is negatively associated with total and nonresource-related greenfield FDI, but not with resource-related greenfield FDI. The insensitivity of resource FDI to political conflict is explained by the high profitability of natural-resource extraction and geographic constraints on location choice. In the nonresource sector, the least geographically diversified firms are most sensitive to conflict. Other types of political violence, including intermittent violence in the form of terrorist acts and assassinations, or persistent but low-impact events, such as political terror, have no effect on the location choice decisions of multinational enterprises. These findings inform the strategies of multinationals with a nuanced and much-needed understanding of the effects of political violence and the risks it poses to their businesses. © 2017 Academy of International Business.","economic geography; foreign direct investment (FDI); heterogeneity; political conflict; political risk; political violence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020489537

In particular, it illustrates how public resistance can prevent the success of direct foreign investments despite favorable agreements with host governments; also, it shows that corporate public diplomacy can be used to develop sustainable win–win solutions supported by the general public. While existing research suggests that an important function of public relations is to create a perception of legitimacy and that the hope of economic and commercial public diplomacy is to create a perception of attractiveness among the public in foreign countries, this paper suggests that the concept of corporate public diplomacy – that is, collaboration with the general public in a host country through negotiations directly with civic society – should be considered a supplement to other forms of corporate diplomacy. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Chinese direct foreign investment; Corporate public diplomacy; Grassroots movements; Legitimacy; Myitsone Dam; Transnational corporations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018702104

In our model average, we entertain different channels of instability by either incorporating breaks in the regression coefficients of each individual model within our model average, breaks in the conditional error variance, or both. Changes in these parameters are driven by mixture distributions for state innovations (MIA) of linear Gaussian state-space models. This framework allows us to compare models that assume small and frequent as well as models that assume large but rare changes in the conditional mean and variance parameters. Results using S&P 500 monthly and quarterly realized volatility data from 1960 to 2014 suggest that Bayesian model averaging in combination with breaks in the regression coefficients and the error variance through MIA dynamics generates statistically significantly more accurate forecasts than the benchmark autoregressive model.

The first is represented by Danish paleoclimatology and their project of deep-ice core drilling in Greenland, which seeks to profile a specific climatic period called “the Eemian”. Dating approximately from 125,000 to 115,000 years BP, the Eemian was the last warm interglacial period before the advent of the Holocene some 12000 years BP, and thus serves as an analogue to contemporary global warming. I contrast this mode of prognostication with the temperature curve by Michael Mann et al. (1998), which demonstrate that global mean temperatures have risen in conjunction with the consumption of fossil fuels visualized in a graph that became known as the “Hockey Stick”. I argue that in the first case we have a form of analogue reasoning, which predicts the past in order to envision the future. In the second case we have a thoroughly modern technology of anticipation, predicated on Enlightenment ideas about the visual economy of chronological timelines. From the vantage point of this contrast, I discuss the political nature of proxies, where I argue that the STS-field could be more attentive to the imaginations and aspirations of the paleoclimatologists themselves. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenland; Hockey stick; Ice cores; Paleoclimatology; Prediction; Proxies","climate variation; core analysis; Eemian; future prospect; Holocene; ice core; interglacial; paleoclimate; prediction; proxy climate record; Arctic; Denmark; Greenland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016640433

Due to an increasing global population, society faces a greater challenge for sustainable food production, quality, distribution, and food safety in the food supply chain. Adopting green supply chain management (GSCM) elements is essential for utilizing the food supply chain in an environmentally benign way. As a solution to the above challenge, the economic and green characteristics for supplier selection in green purchasing are studied in this paper. For an organization, the evaluation and selection of the green supplier is a vital issue due to several tangible and intangible criteria involved. Accordingly, we apply multiple criteria decision aiding techniques. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the revised Simos procedure, PROMETHEE methods, algorithms for constructing a group compromise ranking, and robustness analysis. At first, the revised Simos procedure is used to derive the criteria weights. Next, the PROMETHEE method is applied to rank the suppliers according to each Decision Maker׳s (DM׳s) preferences. Then, the compromise ranking is constructed to minimize the distance of the individual׳s rankings from the solution adopted by the whole group. For this purpose, we introduce and apply some original procedures based on Binary Linear Programming. Finally, the results are validated against the outcomes of robustness analysis. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed approach is endorsed with a case study in an Indian food industry. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Compromise ranking; Food industry; Green supplier selection; Multiple criteria decision analysis; PROMETHEE; Robustness analysis","catering service; food industry; purchasing; system analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007482807

Nevertheless, as entrepreneurship promotion initiatives become global, it becomes relevant to explore the consequences of being engaged in entrepreneurial behavior on entrepreneurial intention. We aim to shed light on whether the direct experience reinforces an individual’s entrepreneurial intention or reduces it. Building on an extended version of the planned behavior theory, we use the behavioral reasoning theory to propose a research design to study the influence of being currently engaged in entrepreneurial behavior on entrepreneurial intention. We introduce individual’s age as an additional moderator of the effects of directly experiencing entrepreneurial behavior. We use PLS-MGA to complete a multi-group SEM analysis for different groups of individuals (from a sample of 430), comparing groups based on their entrepreneurial activity and age group. Results of this research work evidence that current engagement in entrepreneurship activities produces significant differences in the intention to start a new venture between older and younger participants. The results suggest that engagement in entrepreneurial activity modifies entrepreneurial intention and that these effects are contingent to the individual’s age. This research work contributes to the extant call to explore reverse causality between actual behavior and an individual’s intention by introducing behavioral reasoning theory. These results provide support to initiatives to adapt entrepreneurship promotion efforts to the specific characteristics of the participants. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Behavioral reasoning; Entrepreneurial Intention; Senior entrepreneurship; Theory of planned behavior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006154187

This creates a rationale for a general thin capitalization rule limiting the amount of debt that qualifies for interest deductibility. This paper sets up a model of corporate finance and investment in a small open economy to identify the optimal constraint on tax-favoured debt finance, assuming that a given amount of revenue has to be raised from the corporate income tax. For plausible parameter values, the socially optimal debt-asset ratio is 2–3% points below the average corporate debt level currently observed. Driving the actual debt ratio down to this level through limitations on interest deductibility would generate a total welfare gain of about 5% of corporate tax revenue. The welfare gain would arise mainly from a fall in the social risks associated with corporate investment, but also from the cut in the corporate tax rate made possible by a broader corporate tax base. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Optimal constraint on debt finance; Tax bias against equity finance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995780855

Based on these findings, two propositions are developed. Firstly, it is proposed that some academic founders may find themselves in an identity dilemma; choosing between returning to their academic roots normatively speaking or discarding their academic role identity to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities. Secondly and as an alternative, it is suggested that effectuation logics allows inventor-founders situated in volatile international environments to re-use their academic role identity as an important means in leveraging new entrepreneurial opportunities. Consequently, practical implications are drawn recommending that services, such as incubators and tech-transfer offices, incorporate tools that accommodate and assist inventor-founders in this kind of identity dilemma or alternatively employ training programs inspired by an effectuation approach. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Case study; Effectuation; Inventor-founder; Role identity; Think aloud protocol; University spin-off",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960121342

The book is based on the philosophy of Immanuel Kant and the European tradition, which is applied as the foundation for the analysis of the contemporary European and Anglo-American debate on business ethics in order to formulate an up-to-date theory of global business ethics. The book will compare the different schools of business ethics, corporate citizenship, and the philosophy of management and will address the modern-day issues of sustainability, business and human rights, corporate social responsibility, stakeholder management, and corporate governance, offering insights on how to deal with these international challenges of global economics, the development and protection of human rights, and the environment. This book proposes a decision-making model for cosmopolitan business ethics as the foundation of management and leadership in dealing with the complexities of globalization. The case studies will address the efforts of businesses to work with global and cosmopolitan business ethics at the levels of maintaining corporate integrity. Both the theoretical argument and case studies presented in the book are based on exchanges with notable business ethicists, philosophers of management, business managers, and public policy-makers. © 2018 Jacob Dahl Rendtorff.

This leads to the objective of building future power generation system entirely based on renewable sources. Since the power output of ReGen plants, such as wind power plants (WPP), varies continuously and thereby the voltages in the distribution grid, an effective control system is required, to govern the production from all ReGen plants. For this, control messages must be exchanged between the grid assets with reliable information to achieve optimum efficiency. This raises a challenge to assess information reliability and evaluate the performance of a controller. Therefore, considering the dynamic nature of information, this paper analyzes the information reliability in terms of correct and timely delivery of message signals, for remote control of a WPP using IEC-61850 MMS in a smart grid scenario. Based on this measure, the quality of controller performance is also calculated over various imperfect network conditions. © 2017 IEEE.","Communication; IEC-61850; Manufacture Message Specification (MMS); Renewable Generation (ReGen) Plants","Communication; Controllers; Electric power transmission networks; Reliability; Remote control; Smart power grids; Wind power; Controller performance; Distribution grid; Iec-61850; Information reliability; Network condition; Optimum efficiency; Power generation systems; Renewable generation; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029358544

New York: Avon] with Elias and Dunning’s perspective on leisure as part of the spare-time spectrum and leisure sport as a quest for excitement [1986. Quest for Excitement. Sport and Leisure in the Civilizing Process. New York: Basil Blackwell] demonstrates that leisure sport participation must be understood in relation to both spare time, family life, and work life, as these spheres are interrelated.

However, evidence also suggests that organisations have found their integration and implementation challenging. The purpose of this research is therefore to present a framework that methodically guides companies through a five stages and sixteen steps process to effectively integrate and implement the Green, Lean and Six Sigma approaches to improve their sustainability performance. To achieve this, a critical review of the existing literature in the subject area was conducted to build a research gap, and subsequently develop the methodological framework proposed. The paper presents the results from the application of the proposed framework in four organisations with different sizes and operating in a diverse range of industries. The results showed that the integration of Lean Six Sigma and Green helped the organisations to averagely reduce their resources consumption from 20 to 40% and minimise the cost of energy and mass streams by 7–12%. The application of the framework should be gradual, the companies should assess their weaknesses and strengths, set priorities, and identify goals for successful implementation. This paper is one of the very first researches that presents a framework to integrate Green and Lean Six Sigma at a factory level, and hence offers the potential to be expanded to multiple factories or even supply chains. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","framework; Green operations; Lean; Six Sigma; sustainability","Lean production; Process monitoring; Six sigma; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Work simplification; framework; Green operations; Lean; Methodological frameworks; Multiple factories; Resources consumption; Social and environmental; Sustainability performance; Process engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006910756

Recent decades' efforts to govern transitions towards sustainability through public or hybrid regulation display mixed records of support and results. In combination, these issues highlight the need for insights on what conditions multi-stakeholder regulation for a process that balances stakeholder power and delivers results perceived as legitimate by participants and broader society. This book responds to that need. Based on empirical experience on public-private regulation of global sustainability concerns and theoretical perspectives on transnational regulation, the book proposes a new theory on collaborative regulation. This theory sets out a procedural approach for multi-stakeholder regulation of global sustainability issues in a global legal and political order to provide for legitimacy of process and results. It takes account of the claims to participation of the private sector as well as civil society organisations and the need to balance power disparities. © 2018 Karin Buhmann.

The foundation for this issue is the clash and articulation of different kinds of land ownership structures and rights. Under the traditional social or communal ownership system, land belongs to the clans and is distributed among families following tradition-based user rights. The land ownership structures of a capitalist mode of production are only slowly breaking into this system. The analysis is based on institutional analysis including a calculated estimation of the transaction costs for telecom operators seeking to establish contracts for land rental and for enforcing contracts. Quantitative as well as qualitative empirical evidence is analyzed. The paper concludes that the land ownership system in Ghana creates problems for the telecom and tower companies. The communal lands constitute the dominant land ownership system. When this system encounters a private ownership system, a number of land ownership cases are produced, which costs money for the telecom companies. The total transaction costs relating to ownership problems connected with mobile towers are calculated to be between GHC 6.9 and 13.9 million in 2015.

The literature points to two main trends accelerated by digitalisation – work automation that eliminates or changes job functions, and the creation of work without jobs via digital platforms. This article addresses the question as to how social partners define digitalisation of work and their perception of its consequences, while also looking at their recent responses to it. Drawing on interviews with unions and employers' organisations in Denmark, Sweden and Germany, it examines social partner initiatives in the unilateral, tripartite and bipartite arenas on various forms of neo-corporatist labour market regulation. The focus is on service work in the private sector, an area of the economy currently under pressure from both automation and the trend towards work without jobs. Whereas the social partners seem to be very active in the unilateral arena in all three countries, responses differ in the tripartite and bipartite arenas. The article concludes by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the responses in the face of current digitalisation trends and existing models of labour market regulation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Denmark; Digitalisation; Germany; private sector; service work; social dialogue; Sweden",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027300479

Most previous studies have used fictitious brands to test the aforementioned effect, raising concerns about the degree to which these findings are relevant for marketing practice. Brand managers thus might wonder whether labelling product innovations as user-designed and/or user-selected might indeed increase sales for their well-established brands. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating the possible effects of three alternative strategies for labelling innovations (i.e., empowerment-to-select, empowerment-to-create, and full empowerment) for two well-established technology brands. For all three strategies and both brands, we find that involving customers significantly increases the perceived innovation ability, which then positively mediates the effect on behavioural intentions. However, due to a negative direct effect, only labelling products as selected by customers has an overall positive effect. © 2017 The Author(s).","empowerment-to-create; empowerment-to-select; Labelling innovations; technology brands; well-established brands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026350659

Social media has offered promising new possibilities for companies in terms of supporting lead user integration. This paper provides an overview of relevant aspects of lead user research, as well as the identification of lead users. Furthermore, we connect lead user theory with social media and discuss possible ways to identify lead users. Based on the conclusion that existing research does not yet sufficiently provide a detailed understanding on identifying lead users in social media, we conducted an empirical study to gain deeper insights in the social media habits of lead users; this involved a case study comprising 20 interviews. This study's findings present a rather ambivalent picture, concluding that identifying lead users via social media may work with some limitations. Social media can contribute complementary with established approaches like pyramiding to the identification of lead users, but it is not a standalone solution. It strongly depends on the content of the project and on the group of individuals where lead users should be originated. Based on these findings, we derive theoretical and managerial implications and show how companies can utilize social media in addition to established methods for identifying lead users. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of study limitations and recommendations for areas of further research. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Lead user; open innovation; social media; user innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025147412

Focus in this paper is on the trend in older workers’ labour force participation in Denmark, Germany and Sweden since 2004. Main emphasis is given to people aged 65–69 years eligible for social security retirement programs from age 65. The gender aspect is included to accommodate different trends for women and men. To explain country differences in trends, the importance of changes in retirement policies of relevance for this age group and cohort relevant changes in education and health is examined and discussed. Further, country differences in the impact from education and health is examined. Results show that the largest increase in labour force participation among people aged 65–69 years has taken place in Sweden following by Germany, while the increase in Denmark is rather small. While the increase in Germany mainly seems to be a result of policy reforms, the increase in Sweden appear to be a result of a combination of policy changes and an increasing educational level. Financial incentives seem most important in Germany and only of minor importance in Denmark, where policy changes directed towards individuals above the age of 65 appear to have been too small so far to affect retirement behaviour significantly. © 2017, The Author(s).","Education; Employment; Health; Older workers; Program changes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024834637

Despite this important overlap, few studies have assessed how forest-biomass is affected by armed-conflicts. Thus, in this paper we develop a multinomial logit model to examine how outcomes of the interactions between carbon-storage, armed-conflict and deforestation rates are linked to social, institutional and economic factors. We use Colombia as a case study because of its protracted armed-conflict, high forest-cover, sustained deforestation rates and on-going peace processes. Our empirical results show that the impacts of armed-conflicts on forest-cover are connected to specific socio-economical processes, such as unequal land distribution and land-grabbing, which typically occurs as part of ‘agricultural colonization’. Findings address a research gap by providing statistically sound evidence for associations between armed-conflicts and land-related grievances, which has rarely been demonstrated empirically. Our results also suggest that forest commons are associated with reduced armed-conflict, and simultaneously provide contributions to carbon storage and to meeting basic needs. Moreover, our forest-conflict transition models provide useful visual means to capture and relay to policymakers-the causes of forest cover-changes in a conflict-affected country. Finally, our findings imply that in dedicating their efforts to resolving land-ownership disputes, the Colombian government might uphold their international climate change commitments via reducing deforestation and hence forest based carbon emissions, while pursuing their national security objective via undermining opportunities for guerrilla groups to operate. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Armed conflicts; Climate change; Colombia; Forest conflicts; Forest conservation; Multinomial logit model; REDD+","armed forces; carbon sequestration; climate change; colonization; forest cover; logit analysis; nature conservation; tropical forest; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020235979

Previous research defines corporate brand identity as stable and endogenous to the organisation based either on the reputational capital of the organisation or the founder. We challenge this view in this paper from a conceptual and empirical perspective. Combining narrative theory and performativity theory this article suggests brand identity develops as a narrative performance. The study employs a narrative case analysis of interviews and archival data generated during a three-year period to examine the development of corporate brand over time. This study shows that the development of corporate brand identity and the context of the development of new B2B venture are closely intertwined processes and provides a framework for understanding the phenomenon. Brand identity is not a stable core emanating from inside the company but develops over time through a reciprocal sensemaking and dynamic interactions between company and the key external stakeholders in its context.

However, there is scarce empirical evidence as to how managers actually use co-creation to connect with customers and other stakeholders and build enduring innovation-oriented relationships with them. To better understand this, as well as the assumptions of managers and the barriers they encounter in realizing the potential of co-creation, the authors have conducted 20 semi-structured interviews with managers that have led co-creation initiatives for 20 brands. This research finds diverse views of co-creation - from tactical market research tool to strategic collaborative innovation method, and shows that brands can be positioned along a continuum between these two polarities.

In this article, we argue that, in the contemporary situation, critical reflection requires a deliberative ambiance, a process of mutual learning, a consciously organised process of deliberative and distributed reflection. And this especially applies, we argue, to critical reflection concerning a specific subset of technologies which are actually oriented towards optimising human cognition (neuro-enhancement). In order to create a deliberative ambiance, fostering critical upstream reflection on emerging technologies, we developed (in the context of a European 7th Framework Programme project on neuro-enhancement and responsible research and innovation, called NERRI) the concept of a mutual learning exercise (MLE). Building on a number of case studies, we analyse what an MLE involves, both practically and conceptually, focussing on key aspects such as ambiance and expertise, the role of ‘genres of the imagination’ and the profiles of various ‘subcultures of debate’. Ideally, an MLE becomes a contemporary version of the Socratic agora, providing a stage where multiple and sometimes unexpected voices and perspectives mutually challenge each other, in order to strength-en the societal robustness and responsiveness of emerg-ing technologies. © 2017, The Author(s).","Emerging technologies; Moral deliberation; Mutual learning exercises; Neuro-enhancement; Responsible research and innovation; Upstream public engagement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015991829

This is often done by applying independence and coverage tests developed by Christoffersen (International Economic Review, 1998; 39(4), 841–862) to so-called hit-sequences derived from VaR forecasts and realized losses. However, as pointed out in the literature, these aforementioned tests suffer from low rejection frequencies, or (empirical) power when applied to hit-sequences derived from simulations matching empirical stylized characteristics of return data. One key observation of the studies is that higher-order dependence in the hit-sequences may cause the observed lower power performance. We propose to generalize the backtest framework for VaR forecasts, by extending the original first-order dependence of Christoffersen to allow for a higher- or kth-order dependence. We provide closed-form expressions for the tests as well as asymptotic theory. Not only do the generalized tests have power against kth-order dependence by definition, but also included simulations indicate improved power performance when replicating the aforementioned studies. Further, included simulations show much improved size properties of one of the suggested tests. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Action and structure-oriented viewpoints are used as complementing perspectives in the analysis of the ethos of PNS. From the action-perspective we study how prototypes of norms and values are reflected upon in negotiations of normative issues relating to science advice. From the structural perspective we study how interrelated prototypes of norms and values are presupposed in prescriptions, proscriptions, and goals for science advice practices. Through this analysis we identify a plurality of interrelated prototypes of norms and values. Finally, we propose an acronym that integrates the analysed plurality of norms and values.

We demonstrate that domestic food grain price stabilisation through simultaneously subsidising consumers and producers and restricting exports entailed huge fiscal costs and equally large welfare costs to India, an outcome that is almost always the worst as compared to the alternative policy mixes examined in this study. While the most market-oriented domestic and trade policy alternatives that would generate better welfare effects and the least fiscal costs may not be feasible due to political economy considerations, we argue that there exist some ‘middle-ground’ policy mixes featuring partial relaxations of domestic subsidies on either food grains or fertilisers and/or less restrictive border policies, which are superior in terms of their welfare effects and fiscal costs and might also be politically feasible.

To solve the problem, an Affinely Adjustable Robust Optimisation model is developed. At the time when decisions about order periods, ordering quantities and discounts to offer are made, only a forecasted value of demand is available to a decision-maker. The proposed model produces a discount schedule, which is robust against the demand uncertainty. The model is also able to utilise the information about the realised demand from the previous periods in order to make decisions for future stages in an adjustable way. We consider both box and budget uncertainty sets. Computational results show the necessity of accounting for uncertainty, as the total costs of the nominal solution increase significantly even when only a small percentage of uncertainty is in place. It is testified that the affinely adjustable model produces solutions, which perform significantly better than the nominal solutions, not only on average, but also in the worst case.

Throughout his life and career as a manager and management consultant, Taylor worked with organizations to make positive changes, making them better, more efficient, and less reliant on rules of thumb. He changed the notion of the modern organization to one driven and managed by scientific principles. This chapter interprets his work through this lens. It is not intended as a celebration or critique, but rather as an alternative perspective - one that offers or inspires new insights and views on change and on Taylor and his work. The chapter sets out a general introduction before going on to discuss Taylor's main influences and sources of motivation - what was fueling his thinking and driving his actions? From there, we consider Taylor's key contributions, or more precisely his key contributions in his role as a very early proponent of change. This leads us on to a new view of Taylor, from which we ask what can be learned from him today; what new insights, if any, does he bring to perspectives on organizational change? In this context, we review examples of his influence in areas that may be surprising to readers. The chapter ends with a discussion of some unresolved issues - unfinished business and harder-to-transfer ideas that must be addressed if we are to truly harness the potential of Taylor's work and deliberations.

This is with initiatives that focus on cost-efficiencies and turnover improvement. During the last two decades, companies have faced complexity in their supply chains currently with increased global operations. The dynamic business environment forces companies to secure a competitive (re-) design of their supply chains. This paper seeks to advance the understanding on the drivers and barriers for such designs. In total, 39 experts (30 from industrial enterprises, 4 senior supply chain consultants and 5 supply chain management professors) have participated in a four-step Delphi study and have identified main drivers for dynamic supply chain design as being cost reduction, delivery reliability and change in demand for agility. The main barriers are identified as forecasting being too weak, supply chain complexity and product portfolio complexity. In addition, an explorative factor analysis has been carried out to identify how drivers and barriers can be grouped together.

Food has multiple functions for the consumer: it is at one and the same time a source of pleasure, a platform for socializing, a tool for strengthening family life, and an avenue for personal growth. People's dietary intake is the result of a complex range of decisions, and all these decisions have an impact on dietary intake and consequently nutritional status. One of the most important environments in which consumers make decisions is the supermarket. Both the food industry and retailers have in recent years adapted the shopping environment so as to encourage the selection of healthier products. The ability of consumers to make nutritionally sound choices is related to the level of their own nutritional knowledge. Investigations into nutritional knowledge have revealed considerable differences, and these can be linked both to a range of demographic factors and to distinctions between nations. The biggest bottleneck when it comes to turning a supply of nutritious food into a nutritious diet is motivation, or the lack of it. In addition, there is a deeply ingrained conviction that health and pleasure do not go hand in hand, and that food-based indulgence is by necessity unhealthy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Choice; Consumer; Dietary intake; Health; Nutritional content; Nutritional status; Pleasure",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055070318

In a cost optimal design of such a system, most of the renewable generation capacity is placed at locations with favorable weather conditions, that is for instance onshore wind in countries bordering the North Sea and solar PV in South European countries. Countries with less favorable renewable generation conditions benefit from this capacity by importing the respective electricity as power flows through the transmission grid. Using flow tracing techniques, we disentangle the emerging pattern of imports and exports and assign shares of the distributed generation capacity in the European system to the countries which actually make use of them.

We find that the most restrictive barriers against flexibility are emitted by public authorities as part of broader policy strategies. Overall, we find that current regulatory and market framework conditions do not hinder flexibility.

On the background of the fast development of offshore wind energy and its connection to the onshore electricity systems, a coordinated grid development in the North Sea may not only save costs for individual wind farms, but also deliver additional benefits through the provision of increased interconnection of electricity markets. The previous studies do not include offshore wind development with high ambition in the long term perspective and do not focus on the assessment of the specific effects on the economic value of offshore wind farms connected to Belgium, Norway the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany (North Sea Link, Cobra Cable, Viking Link, Nord Link, BritNed and Nemo Link). This paper tries to shed some lights on the substantial differences in the expected economic exposure of wind power plants and transmission lines to the development of the electricity grid in the North Sea. Since details of the prospective energy system around the North Sea region shape these revenue expectations, we further develop and apply the energy model Balmorel. The tool is used to quantify effects of the implementation of a meshed offshore grid compared to a radial grid that connects wind farms in a non-coordinated fashion to the countries by 2050.

Considerable flexibility potentials exist from large consumers, e.g. power-to-heat (P2H) in district heating (DH). However, the existing grid tariffs obliterate the price signals from the wholesale electricity market and diminish the business cases for these technologies by increasing the costs of their electricity consumption. With the present tariff structure, only a very small part of the flexibility potential is deployed or operated flexible. In this paper we compare two different grid tariff designs that facilitate more flexible energy demand of DH operators. This is illustrated by a case study of Denmark that clearly demonstrates that the introduction of innovative tariffs will improve the business case for flexible P2H technologies and increase the value of VRE. In this way larger flexibility potentials can be induced and larger shares of VRE become integrated in the energy systems. © 2017 IEEE.","Electricity Market Operation; Energy; Grid tariffs; Market Integration of Renewable Energies; Power system economics1","Commerce; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Power markets; Electricity market operations; Energy; Grid tariffs; Market integration; Power system economics; Electric power system economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027103845

Due to inherent incompatibilities, for years, studying Scrum and its application in distributed setups has been subject to theoretical and applied research, and an increasing body of knowledge reports insights into this combination. Through a systematic literature review, this paper contributes a collection of experiences on the application of Scrum to global software engineering (GSE). In total, we identified 40 challenges in 19 categories practitioners face when using Scrum in GSE. Among the challenges, scaling Scrum to GSE and adopting practices accordingly are the most frequently named. Our findings also show that most solution proposals aim at modifying elements of the Scrum core processes. We thus conclude that, even though Scrum allows for extensive modification, Scrum itself represents a barrier for global software engineering, and development teams have to customize Scrum properly to benefit from agile software development in GSE. © 2017 IEEE.","Agile software development; Global software engineering; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping study","Application programs; Software design; Agile software development; Body of knowledge; Development teams; Distributed setups; Distributed software engineering; Global software engineering; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Software engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027714719

However, many ecodesign efforts are geared towards tackling single-issue discrete improvements, in contrast to operationalizing, measuring and acting upon the consistent improvement of ecodesign implementation and management. To enable a systematic and streamlined integration of ecodesign practices into the product development processes, adequate mechanisms are needed to capture and measure performance improvements, and thereby achieve consistent improvements in a company's efforts towards enhanced sustainability performance. In face of this challenge, this paper aims at providing organizations with a set of process-oriented indicators to supporting and enhancing ecodesign implementation and management. This research was grounded on a 2-phase approach to (i) cross-analyze performance indicators from literature against ecodesign practices at the process level and (ii) propose, evaluate and consolidate new indicators. After being subjected to the evaluation of 8 experts in ecodesign, a repository is presented with 27 indicators from literature and a set of 114 newly proposed indicators for companies to customize, adapt, mix and derive according to their needs, strategic drivers and overall context. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ecodesign implementation; Ecodesign management practices; Performance indicators; Performance measurement; Sustainable product development","Benchmarking; Product development; Sustainable development; Ecodesign practices; Management practices; Manufacturing companies; Performance indicators; Performance measurements; Product development process; Sustainability performance; Sustainable product development; Ecodesign",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019162516

Assembly line systems are widely utilized to assemble different types of products and in recent years, robots have become extensively utilized, replacing manual labor. This paper focuses on minimizing the carbon footprint for robotic assembly line systems, a topic that has received limited attention in academia. This paper is primarily focused on developing a mathematical model to simultaneously minimize the total carbon footprint and maximize the efficiency of robotic assembly line systems. Due to the NP-hard nature of the considered problem, a multi-objective co-operative co-evolutionary (MOCC) algorithm is developed to solve it. Several improvements are applied to enhance the performance of the MOCC for obtaining a strong local search capacity and faster search speed. The performance of the proposed MOCC algorithm is compared with three other high-performing multi-objective methods. Computational and statistical results from the set of benchmark problems show that the proposed model can reduce the carbon footprint effectively. The proposed MOCC outperforms the other three methods by a significant margin as shown by utilizing one graphical and two quantitative Pareto compliant indicators. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Co-evolutionary computation; Multi-objective optimization; Robotic assembly line balancing","Assembly; Assembly machines; Carbon footprint; Efficiency; Evolutionary algorithms; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Robotics; Assembly line systems; Bench-mark problems; Co-evolutionary; Co-evolutionary algorithm; Limited attentions; Robotic assembly line balancing; Robotic assembly lines; Sustainable products; Robotic assembly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019150642

However, the few existing studies that aim to evaluate the environmental performance of insect farming systems are extremely limited in scope. This paper presents the first case of a life cycle assessment (LCA) performed on an existing production system of Gryllus bimaculatus De Geer (field cricket) and Acheta domesticus (house cricket) production in north-eastern Thailand and compares it with broiler production in the same region. The system boundaries of the production system considered the entire production cycle of edible crickets as well as processing. The study included two functional units (1 kg of edible mass and 1 kg of protein in edible mass). Irrespective of the functional unit, larger impacts were associated with broiler production. Major hotspots for cricket and broiler production were related to the production soybean meal and maize grain for feed. A scaled-up cricket farming system which was considered as a possible 'future' scenario demonstrated a reduction in overall environmental impacts when compared to current cricket production and industrial broiler production. While scaled-up cricket farming showed fewer overall environmental impacts, intensified systems could potentially have reduced socioeconomic impacts on rural areas in Thailand. Improvement options could be adopted by undertaking further research into the formulation of local feeds and acquiring improved knowledge about cricket nutrition. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Crickets; Entomophagy; Environmental impact; Insect farming; LCA","Economics; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Broiler productions; Crickets; Entomophagy; Environmental performance; Insect farming; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Socio-economic impacts; Sustainable solution; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019081563

By questioning the conduct of their conduct, participants simultaneously question the relationship of the self to itself, playing with and risking identity in the process. The case study scrutinises video recordings of the ""United Nathans weapons inspectors"" protest theatre event that took place in 2003. Using Ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis (EMCA), the chapter examines how 'counter-identities' are achieved and made accountable in the interactional practices of the prefigurative protest event.

The method is based on minimisation of the potential energy. For structures with inelastic response, some of the applied energy is converted to non-mechanical energy. This part of the energy is dissipated. According to the conservation of energy the dissipated energy must simultaneously be subtracted the mechanical energy in order to determine the change of the potential energy. Changes of the strains in the structure, from non-static conditions, such as thermal deformations and shrinkage, as well as plastic strains from previous load scenarios, will also change the potential energy. The method is also capable of taken these effects into account. Three examples are included in order to support the physical understanding, and to illustrate the procedure for the application of the method.

The findings of this article contribute to existing research by showing that moral cosmopolitanism reflects a more individualized and less engaged form of consumption than ethical consumption. They illustrate how urban consumers perform distinction in contexts where nature is the most exotic unexplored context, highlighting further the reterritorialization of global cosmopolitan consumption, where food trends can only be consumed authentically in their context of origin.

The interviewees’ narratives revealed that their everyday lives as unskilled migrant workers had a decisive influence on their opportunities of engaging in LTPA: most women struggled with the demands of a physically exhausting job and an extensive ‘second shift’ at home and therefore had great difficulty finding the time and energy to exercise.

The authors assess a public policy change in the Danish healthcare sector from 2011 which required that some hospital services had to be centralized leading to specialization within the merged departments. Design/methodology/approach – Taking an institutional theory perspective, the authors conduct a natural experiment. The data include 24,694 observations of urological patient treatments from 2010 to 2012. Findings – The econometric difference-in-difference analysis finds that the readmission rate decreases by approximately four percentage points in the departments affected by the policy change. Contrary to expectations, the length of stay increases by 0.38 days. The authors complement the natural experiment with a mixed-methods approach that includes proprietary data from the management control system of the hospital, public documentation on the policy change, as well as interviews with key informants. These data suggest that operational deficiency is related to the fact that specialization was externally enforced through the public policy change. The authors illustrate how the hospital staff struggle for legitimacy after this policy change, and how cost savings obstructed the specialized department in achieving its goals. Originality/value – The authors conclude that the usual economies-of-scales-based logic of (higher)volume-(better)outcome studies cannot easily be transferred to specialization in hospitals, unless one accounts for the institutional reason of the specialization. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Hospital; Length of stay; Natural experiment; Operational performance; Specialization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136439273

The authors shed light on DOL product distribution and examine its evolution during a 14-year period (2001–2014). DOLs remain a quality differentiation scheme predominantly for the southern EU agrifood industry. However, the less restrictive requirements for protected geographical indication certification make it a much more popular DOL in northern EU. To promote its food quality policy, the EU must approach the two DOL types differently, as they have a different growth potential among EU countries.

This is unfortunate because it has been hypothesized that such organizations will be more creative and will perform better than mono-cultural organizations if communication issues are dealt with correctly by managers. In this study, we test the general hypothesis that inclusive language use by managers and employees in formal and informal situations will increase the creativity and performance in multicultural organizations. By use of responses from 676 individuals employed in privately owned multicultural companies, we found that management common language communication was strongly associated with performance but not with creativity. Openness to language diversity among employees, however, had strong relations with both creativity and performance. This indicates that management communication may provide information and a shared identity that can increase the performance of an organization. Yet in order to increase creativity, there is a need to also facilitate inclusive group processes. The findings provide new insights into the theoretical idea that diversity leads to creativity and performance if communication is managed correctly. © The Author(s) 2015.","Common corporate language; Creativity; Diversity; Language management; Language use; Management communication; Multicultural organizations; Openness to diversity; Performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044150039

A survey experiment among Texas school principals shows how emphasizing the normative value of ethnic and cultural differences increases the discrepancy between white and minority bureaucrats' attitudes toward a minority-supportive policy.

The impact of empathic abilities on decision-making is considered an important research question, as our knowledge remains limited as to the importance of personal ability on decisions. The article further contributes to the field of street-level bureaucracy by conducting a discrete choice experiment, an approach highly suitable for examining discretionary decision-making. The article draws on nationally representative survey data from 268 employees in correctional facilities in Denmark, with a 67.5% response rate. The findings confirm that discretionary decision-making is affected by the empathic abilities of bureaucrats. However, the impact of empathy depends on the severity of inmates' infringement against the rules.

This paper investigates the accounting practices that underpin this new form of organizing, and in doing so confronts a significant challenge within the accounting literature: the need to escape what Hopwood (1996) describes as its “hierarchical consciousness”. In order to do so, this paper develops the concept of evaluative infrastructure which describes accounting practices that enable platform based organization. They are evaluative because they deploy a plethora of interacting devices, including rankings, ratings, reviews, and audits to establish orders of worth. They are infrastructures because they provide the invisible yet essential mechanisms for the flow of economic activity and exchange on platforms. Illustrating the concept of evaluative infrastructure with the example of eBay, the paper's contribution is to (1) provide an analytical vocabulary to capture the accounting practices underpinning platforms as new organizational forms, and in so doing (2) extend accounting scholars’ analytical focus from hierarchical settings towards heterarchies. Conceptually, this shift from management accounting to evaluative infrastructures entails a focus on relationality (evaluative infrastructures do not represent or reference but relate things, people and ideas with each other); generativity (evaluative infrastructures do not territorialize objects but disclose new worlds); and new forms of control (evaluative infrastructures are not centres of calculation; rather, control is radically distributed, whilst power remains centralized). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting; Evaluation; Hierarchical consciousness; Infrastructure; Platform organization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021776056

However, individuals enhance and/or compensate for the effects of their status characteristics by virtue of their core self-evaluations. A study of over 230 individuals from 46 nationalities working in 36 self-managing teams generally supports the expected main and moderation effects.

Our analysis of 2648 inventors in the pharmaceutical industry shows that for those performing above their reference group (of past and current co-inventors in patenting), an increase in relative performance decreases the likelihood of mobility, and for those performing below the reference group, a decrease in relative performance decreases the likelihood of mobility.

TRS, therefore, differs from private ridesharing, which refers to sharing of rides among private people. TRS is a more restricted dynamic dial-a-ride problem, which considers the requirements of both multiple passengers and the service provider. Because of the pooled simultaneous utilization of a taxi, TRS is collaborative consumption [This definition has been pasted from the paper, Section 2.2. References are provided there] (TRS) is an advanced form of urban transportation that matches separate ride requests with similar spatio-temporal characteristics to a jointly used taxi. As collaborative consumption, TRS saves customers money, enables taxi companies to economize use of their resources, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. We develop a one-to-one TRS approach that matches rides with similar start and end points. We evaluate our approach by analyzing an open dataset of &gt; 5 million taxi trajectories in New York City.

The empirical contribution and managerial implications provide nine specific suggestions for how pharmaceutical management groups can better support radical pharmaceutical FEI through targeted HRM practices. The derived results of the study also underline inherent challenges of the pharmaceutical industry and regulations (FDA) that may not stimulate radical innovation, which cannot be resolved by HRM, but require the attention of policy makers.

The findings reveal two important antecedents to the application of social media that overcome the gap between acknowledging the usefulness of social media and its actual limited application in practical B2B contexts. First, open collaborative business model innovation is needed to apply social media in local business processes. Second, central and distributed leadership must be integrated to create ownership and responsibility across the SME organisation and beyond to customers and partners. These findings differ from the social media application stages and the gaps between them identified in the previous literature.

The research continued with a second approach in 2014 within operation and maintenance (O&M) through focus group interviews and subsequent individual interviews with 20 enterprises and a seminar in May 2015. The findings reveal opportunities and challenges for SMEs according to three different routes for cooperation and collaboration with larger enterprises: demand-driven cooperation, supplier-driven cooperation and partner-driven collaboration. The SME contribution to innovation and competiveness is different within the three routes and ranges from providing specific knowledge, providing a ‘one-stop’ SME-supplier-unity and long term innovation collaboration on equal terms for competiveness, respectively. The findings reveal that it is beneficial, but difficult, for SMEs to move from the arm's length approach given by the tender legislation towards the other outlined routes.

Therefore, strategies that aim to reduce food waste have great potential to improve sustainability of the agricultural and food supply chains. Consumer-related food waste is a complex issue that needs collaboration between various supply chain actors and sector stakeholders. Although a range of initiatives from various actors already exists internationally, there is still a lack of knowledge on which lessons can be derived from such cases. The current multiple case study provides insights into how to successfully design future actions, by analysing common and distinct key success factors in 26 existing initiatives to reduce consumer-related food waste. The findings reveal that collaboration between stakeholders, timing and sequence of initiatives, competencies that the initiative is built on, and a large scale of operations are key success factors. Success factors are identified for the primary design, for the development and maintenance phase, and for reaching out to consumers. There are three general types of initiatives that differ in their aims and characteristics: information and capacity building, redistribution, and retail and supply chain alteration. The first type focuses most strongly on motivating consumer food waste avoidance behaviour and strengthening consumer abilities, while the second and third focus primarily on altering consumer food choice context, but combine this with aspects of raising awareness. Recommendations are derived for future initiatives which should take inspiration from existing initiatives, especially considering the right partners, competencies involved, timing the start of the initiative right, and aim to soon achieve a large scale. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Consumers; Food waste; Initiatives; Success factors; Supply chain","Environmental impact; Food supply; Sustainable development; Consumers; Food waste; Initiatives; Key characteristics; Key success factors; Multiple-case study; Success factors; Supply chain actors; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007413949

The fundamental feature of firms in hypercompetitive settings is that they are constantly challenged to improve their competitiveness in a relentless race to outperform one another. Analyzing a unique data set from the Formula 1 motorsport racing industry, we find an inverse U-shaped relationship between team diversity in task-related experience and performance an important result that diverges from well-established theories developed in more stable environments. Fundamentally, we show that the role of R&D team experience diversity varies depending on the size of the organizations in which R&D teams operate. While we find a moderating effect for firm age, this effect is not as robust as that of firm size. Managerial summary: This article examines the relationship between R&D team composition and performance in fast-moving environments. Firms in these environments are constantly challenged to improve their competitiveness by outperforming one another. Analyzing a unique data set from the Formula 1 motorsport racing industry, we find that a team's diversity in job-related experience increases its performance up to a certain extent. Once R&D teams become too diverse, performance decreases because communication and coordination become more difficult. We also show that the role of R&D team diversity varies depending on the size of the organizations in which R&D teams operate. Overall, our findings provide several novel implications for the strategy, innovation, and team literatures. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

To explore why, this article links crisis information dilemmas to blame avoidance concepts from democratic political theories. We argue that greater Chinese transparency about infectious disease response reflects evolution in blame avoidance, from heavy reliance on information control to insulating leaders by using technical experts and agencies as “lightning rods.” In 2003, the Chinese strategy of information containment and secrecy backfired, and the Chinese leadership eventually received blame at home and internationally for crisis mismanagement. In 2009, China put in place public health specialists and institutions as responsible for H1N1 information and responses, thereby insulating the top-tier leadership. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994893552

Emerging applications of lithium-ion batteries (hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, grid support) are becoming more and more power demanding. The increasing charging and discharging power capability rates of lithium-ion batteries raises safety concerns and requires thermal management of the entire battery system. Moreover, lithium-ion battery's temperature influences both battery short term (capacity, efficiency, self-discharge) and long-term (lifetime) behaviour. Thus, thermal modelling of lithium-ion battery cells and battery packs is gaining importance. Equivalent thermal circuits' models have proven to be relatively accurate with a low computational burden for the price of low spatial resolution; nevertheless, they usually require expensive equipment for parametrization. Recent research initiated by Barsoukov et al. proposed electrothermal impedance spectroscopy as a novel and non-destructive method of characterizing the thermal properties of batteries by defining frequency dependent thermal impedance. Despite its usefulness, the electrothermal impedance spectroscopy method can be still improved in terms of e.g. accuracy and measurement time and it has a potential to be extended to new applications. Performed review indicates that the electrothermal impedance spectroscopy is a very promising, non-destructive, simple and especially cost-efficient method for thermal characterization of batteries. The scientific intention of this paper is to collect and systematize the state of knowledge about electrothermal impedance spectroscopy and present different measurement methods on the example of a high-power lithium battery cell and finally to discuss the prospect. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Battery thermal model; Electrothermal impedance spectroscopy; Lithium-ion battery; Thermal impedance","Costs; Electric batteries; Electric discharges; Electric heating; Hybrid vehicles; Ions; Lithium; Lithium alloys; Lithium compounds; Nondestructive examination; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Secondary batteries; Spectroscopic analysis; Spectroscopy; Emerging applications; Equivalent thermal circuits; Impedance spectroscopy; Nondestructive methods; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Thermal characterization; Thermal impedance; Thermal model; Lithium-ion batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994409980

In particular, they have higher frequencies of reading, museum and performing arts attendance, and are more likely to be involved in active music participation.

Specifically, the algorithm does not ""see"" the full sorted array, but only the single position that it accesses during each step of the computation.

By many measures the impact of the crisis was severe. The fall in GDP, the collapse of world trade, the rise in unemployment, and the credit slump reached bigger proportions than in any other crisis since World War II. Although the economic figures seem to improve in some countries, the crisis continues being a challenging issue and is said to be one of the most important problems governments face today. The crisis has put public finances under ever increasing pressure, and governments have responded through austerity measures such as new fiscal rules and budgeting procedures and cutbacks of public spending. Public Management in Times of Austerity seeks to explore the austerity policies adopted by European governments and their consequences to public management. It asks how governments have implemented new rules leading to more stringency in public budgeting and financial management, and how they have cut back public expenditure. These questions are examined comparatively through case studies in different parts of Europe, and variations across countries are discussed and explained. Throughout the volume, the consequences of the crisis and austerity policies for public management are discussed. What is the relationship between crisis and decision-making in the public sector, and how does austerity affect public-sector organisation?

Due to their wide application, detergents are continuously developed to meet higher quality and environmental standards. Following this trend, this study discusses a life cycle analysis conducted on different detergents and industrial washing systems. In particular, detergent production, use, and feasible recovery in the laundering industry is evaluated. Detergent production shows wide impact distribution related to the various detergent sources, with a large influence on the ecosystem compared to the other impact categories. Calculations of the primary energy demand and the global warming potential reveal the fundamental role of the application of renewable resources in the detergent production phase. The calculated contribution of detergents in the overall impacts of washing processes is also significant: detergent use and discharge represent crucial issues to be addressed to reduce the environmental burdens of the laundering industry. Two membrane-based processes are thus proposed to recover water and detergents coupling the washing cycle with wastewater treatment and partial reuse. Addition of membrane setups to existing washing systems has negligible environmental burdens and energy demand, but it results in significant environmental gains: up to 50% of the overall impact can be reduced thanks to the recovery of resources in situ. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Detergent recovery; Laundery industry; Life cycle assessment; Membrane integrated treatment; Ultrafiltration; Wastewater treatment","Energy management; Global warming; Laundering; Life cycle; Recovery; Soaps (detergents); Ultrafiltration; Washing; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water filtration; Environmental burdens; Environmental standards; Global warming potential; Industrial processs; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Membrane-based process; Primary energy demand; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018597247

It will help industries to develop strategies for managing the SC effectively and ensuring improvement in performance continuously. To achieve this, this work proposes to use a two-phase research methodology. First, 36 SC performance improvement indicators are recognised from a literature survey and from field and industrial expert’s inputs. Secondly, a structural model is proposed using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to prioritise the indicators strategically to improve the SC performance. The fuzzy AHP method helps determine the priority of concerns of the identified indicators under fuzzy surroundings. Inputs in this research are taken from four ancillary Indian plastic manufacturing firms. Research findings indicate that collaborations and information exchange dimension indicators obtained the highest priority in improving SC performance. The model proposed is considered very useful for the SC managers/practitioners/decision-makers to understand better and distinguish the essential SC performance improvement indicators and to take systematic decisions specifically to improve the performance of business in a SC context. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the priority ranking of the indicators. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP); multi criteria decision making (MCDM); SC performance improvements indicators; sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management (SCM)","Analytic hierarchy process; Decision making; Hierarchical systems; Manufacture; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy processes (AHP); Information exchanges; Manufacturing companies; Multi-criteria decision making; Research methodologies; Supply chain managements (SCM); Supply chain performance; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019488732

It will seek to clarify what is meant by “being there yet” and it will argue that the most positive proponents for this field are way too optimistic about the current state and what impact it will have on HR in the short-to-medium term but that the long-term outlook remain positive for the field. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper and the conclusions draw upon the author’s experience in the field. Findings: It has been widely acknowledged that HR analytics is still a fairly immature field and has not yet reached its full potential. In this viewpoint, the author argues that the most positive proponents for this field are way too optimistic about the current state and what impact it will have on HR in the short-to-medium term but that the long-term outlook remains positive for the field. The author names four main reasons why HR analytics is still in its infancy: maturity, mindset, organization and competencies. Practical implications: If these four aspects are addressed, the HR analytics function will be able to contribute much more to HR’s role as a value generator. Originality/value: Focusing on these aspects will set HR analytics up for success and will lead to potentially large shareholder value creation. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competencies; Data quality; Future of HR; HR analytics; Strategic HR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051482900

This property of heterogeneity should express itself in a variety of empirical “signatures,” such as firm performance and arguably systematic and persistent differences in firm-level growth rates, with low cost firms outpacing high cost firms. While this property of performance differences is a robust regularity, the empirical evidence on firm growth and Gibrat's law does not support the later conjecture. Gibrat's law, or the “law of proportionate effect,” states that, across a population of firms and over time, firm growth at any point is, on average, proportionate to size of the firm. We develop a theoretical argument that provides a reconciliation of this apparent paradox. The model implies that in early stages of an industry history. firm growth may have a systematic component, but for much of an industry's and firm's history should have a random pattern consistent with the Gibrat property. The intuition is as follows. In a Cournot equilibrium, firms of better “type” (i.e., lower cost) realize a larger market share, but act with some restraint on their choice of quantity in the face of a downward sloping demand curve and recognition of their impact on the market price. If firms are subject to random firm-specific shocks, then in this equilibrium setting a population of such firms would generate a pattern of growth consistent with Gibrat's law. However, if broader evolutionary dynamics of firm entry, and the subsequent consolidation of market share and industry shake-out is considered, then during early epochs of industry evolution, one would tend to observe systematic differences in growth rates associated with firm's competitive fitness. Thus, it is only in these settings far from industry equilibrium that we should see systematic deviations from Gibrat's law.

This calls for additional flexibility in the power market. The right coupling to the underlying national and local district heating (DH) markets can generate large amounts of flexibility. However, regulatory barriers and different energy market designs may hinder the potential benefits from system integration, and lower the potential that can be realized. The Scandinavian countries have a large extension of DH with a good potential for providing flexibility services to the electricity market.We survey and discuss regulatory barriers and drivers for exploiting this potential for flexibility. Combined heat and power (CHP) is widely integrated in the power market, but it is threatened by low electricity prices due to the increasing amounts of wind power. Power-to-heat technologies, electric boilers and heat pumps are blocked by high tariffs and taxes.

Whereas neurophysiological responses such as pupil dilation and galvanic skin response (GSR) have provided a significant explanatory value in the mechanisms of decision-making, other, less known physiological responses indicators, such as body posture, may provide additional valuable insight into decision-making processes. Here, we report the results from two separate high-resolution eye-tracking studies in which pupil dilation and body posture provide both independent and interacting contributions in predicting preference judgments and choice. These results suggest an improved assessment and prediction of choice by using a combination of pupil dilation and posture, relative to only employing 1 of the measures. However, the use of this combined measure needs to be employed with care, as the dynamic relationship between pupil size and posture is affected by different categories of stimuli, in particular, fashion brands, and wine brand logos. We discuss these findings in light of the academic and commercial call for neuroimaging and physiology measures that can predict and explain the mechanisms underlying preference formation and value-based choice. © 2017 American Psychological Association.","Consumer choice; Eye-tracking; Neuroeconomics; Preferences; Pupil dilation","arousal; Article; body position; consumer; consumer choice; consumer preference; decision making; distance perception; dynamics; exploratory research; female; human; mathematical analysis; neuroimaging; normal human; post hoc analysis; predictive value; priority journal; pupil; pupil dilation; root mean square deviation; stimulation; vision; visual brightness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027547110

We show that the collective professional role identity of family physicians was changed through a process of reinterpreting multiple logics and their relationships. Through our inductive analyses, we identified four mechanisms that occurred through social interactions and collectively served to rearrange the constellation of logics guiding physician role identity: (1) revealing the influence of a hidden logic; (2) reinforcing the conflict between logics; (3) reframing the meaning of a dominant logic; and (4) re-embedding the new arrangement of logics. We found that the change in physician professional role identity required significant identity work by a group of actors, but particularly by the managers who had been charged with leading the reform initiative.

The video websites entail NDV-related applications such as detection of copyright violation, video monitoring, video re-ranking, and video recommendation. Since these applications adopt different features and different processing procedures due to diverse scenarios, constructing separate and special-purpose systems for them incurs considerable costs on design, implementation, and maintenance. In this article, we propose a general NDV system on Storm (GVoS)-a popular distributed real-time stream processing platform-to simultaneously support a wide variety of video applications. The generality of GVoS is achieved in two aspects. First, we extract the reusable components from various applications. Second, we conduct the communication between components via a mechanism called Stream Shared Message (SSM) that contains the video-related data. Furthermore, we present an algorithm to reduce the size of SSM in order to avoid the data explosion and decrease the network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that GVoS can achieve performance almost the same as the customized systems. Meanwhile, GVoS accomplishes remarkably higher systematic versatility and efficiently facilitates the development of various NDV-related applications. © 2017 ACM.","General system; Near duplicate video; Phrases; Real-time processing; Retrieval and detection","Storms; Websites; Exponential increase; General systems; Near-duplicate videos; Phrases; Processing procedures; Realtime processing; Reusable components; Video applications; Video signal processing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022204045

The roots of postmodernist critique lie in careful empirical observation of how social reality is being constructed in local contexts. Because knowledge, subjects, power, and value are social accomplishments, they are neither fixed nor without alternative. Many key developments in marketing theory such as assemblage theory, practice and consumer tribes formulate alternative accounts of how precisely constructing social facts occur. When further advancing these and other critical approaches, it must always be taken into account that society and culture manifest in concrete, local situations. Data sets or theories that do not take the local production of social order into account, hence fail to provide sensible insight. I propose the principle of methodological situationalism as a litmus test to the analytical strength of a theory or piece of research. The principle states that theoretically adequate accounts of social phenomena must be grounded in empirical observations of manifest meaning or social order in concrete situations. This does not mean that macro-processes or structures should be ignored, but that their roots and effects in local lived life have to be scrutinized. Critical theorizing does not need to resort to utopian or ideological arguments about the grand scheme of things. Careful empirical work zooming in on social life in concrete situations will provide plenty of novel insight and critical edge. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Actor–network theory; assemblage theory; consumer culture theory; consumer tribes; epistemology; interpretative consumer research; methodological situationalism; postmodernist theory; practice theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020411685

It is often the case that process manufactured products are not designed concurrently, so by the end of the product design phase the Process Manufacturing Concept (PMC) has yet to be decided. Allocating process capa-ble tolerances to the product during the design phase is therefore not possi-ble. The robustness of the concept (how capable it is to achieve the product specification), only becomes clear at this late stage and thus after testing and iteration. In this article, a method for calculating the unit-to-unit robustness of an early-stage for a PMC is proposed. The method uses variability and adjust-ability information from the manufacturing concept in combination with sensitivity information from products' design to predict its functional perfor-mance variation. A Technology maturation factor for addressing varied pro-cess capability confidence was applied. A four-step process of Define, Connect, Map and Quantify was proposed for calculating PMC robustness and was tested for a wound-care product. The results show that the method was appli-cable and enabled PMC selection based on quantified robustness. The case also demonstrates that higher robustness is possible even at higher parame-ter variability with suitable measurements and adjustability. © 2017 PEI, University of Maribor.

Ethnography in the context of retail food waste disposition reveals tensions experienced by several marketplace actors – namely consumers, retail firms and regulators – and investigates an alternative market arrangement that alleviates those tensions by connecting the actors and their practices in a creative new way.

The findings reveal a complexity of recording behavior and show how frontline staff shift between recording logics according to the situation. The actual data recordings depend not only on the overall logic but also on factors such as attitudes, assumptions, and motives.

We advance the relational perspective on individual creativity by adopting a contingency view, and showing that a curvilinear (inverted U-shape) specification of the relationship between brokerage and creativity applies particularly when brokers work in research and development, as they are more likely to intensively exploit their structural opportunities. In addition, we show that brokers who work in research and development are more sensitive to work environments that protect their cognitive resources, such that they exhibit greater creativity when the work environment is free from environmental stressors, such as noise and disturbances. Thus, environmental stressors are particularly harmful for those employees who are most likely to exploit the opportunity to broker across otherwise disconnected colleagues. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","creativity; environmental stressor; research and development; social network","creativity; employee; human; human experiment; noise; social network; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018414889

This study investigated the mediation effects of supplier related corporate social responsibility practices in the relationships of stakeholder pressure and environmental, social, and financial performance. This study further examined the moderating role of sourcing geography (local versus global) in these relationships. This study is based on data from 381 manufacturing firms across 22 countries via sixth round of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS-VI). A bootstrapping technique was used for testing mediation, as well as moderated-mediation for the assessment of the moderating role of sourcing geography (local versus global) on the mediation effects. The results in this study suggest supplier related corporate social responsibility practices to have mediation effect in the relationship of stakeholder pressure and environmental performance, and stakeholder pressure and financial performance, respectively, with no mediation effects found for social performance. Furthermore, our results show the moderating role of sourcing geography (local versus global) in the mediation effects of supplier related corporate social responsibility practices within the relationships of stakeholder pressure and environmental and social performance, respectively, yet do not show such effects for financial performance.

The RTPSP is to determine when to perform the construction works and in which track possessions while satisfying different operational constraints and minimizing the total construction cost. To find an optimal solution of the RTPSP, this paper proposes an approach that, first, transfers the nominal market prices into track-possession-based real prices, and then generates a schedule of the construction works by solving a mixed-integer linear-programming model for the given track blocking proposal. The proposed approach is tested on a real-life case study from the Danish railway infrastructure manager. The results show that, in 2 h of computing time, the approach is able to provide solutions that are within 0.37% of the optimal one for six different blocking proposals and two alternative construction providers, so it can be used as an effective support tool in the primary planning stage to suggest preferable track possessions within the existing railway services. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Costs; Integer programming; Railroad plant and structures; Railroad tracks; Railroads; Scheduling; Transportation; Construction works; Large-scale projects; Mixed integer linear programming model; Operational constraints; Optimal scheduling; Railway infrastructure; Scheduling problem; Total construction costs; Railroad transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017523543

A strategic reserve (SR) policy with administratively set capacity targets, a capacity market (CM) based on public procurement, and a decentralized reserve market with the obligation of generators to finance reserves in relation to their peak supply (RM). Substantial differences of policies arise across countries and regarding consumers and producers due to power plant structures. By 2023, we find the decentralized RM to induce least pronounced distributional effects and only modest welfare reductions, while SR and CM induce higher losses. In the longer term until 2033, welfare results differ less pronounced, although the RM is most friendly to consumers.

Recently, however, multinational enterprises (MNEs) have felt increasing pressure to comply with transfer pricing tax regulation. As a result, tax risk management considerations play a key role in the transfer pricing decisions of MNEs today. This case seeks to provide you with examples of the core principles of international transfer pricing, as well as to allow you to discuss international transfer pricing in the context of responsibility accounting. Specifically, the case study is a fictional MNE, allowing you to apply the OECD Guidelines in practice to cross-border transfers within an MNE, and to discuss the implications of tax-based transfer pricing for responsibility accounting. As a basis for working on the case study, the Appendix provides an overview of the ‘OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations’ (OECD, 2010), hereafter OECD Guidelines, upon which most transfer pricing regulations worldwide are based. It includes an introduction to the arm's length principle, OECD-accepted transfer pricing methods, and comparability analysis procedures for identifying comparable transactions between independent parties.

This has gained empirical support in multiple life domains, but little is known about the way that need satisfaction interacts between work and home. Drawing from ideas of work–home compensation, we expect that the benefits of need satisfaction in the home domain are reduced when needs are satisfied in the work domain. We tested this hypothesis with a daily diary study involving 91 workers. Results showed that individuals particularly benefit from satisfaction of their need for competence in the home domain when it is not satisfied during the working day. No such interactions were found between the needs for autonomy or relatedness. Our study highlights that the interaction of need satisfaction across domains represents a boundary condition for the beneficial effects of need satisfaction. Practitioner points: The study examines the interplay between daily need satisfaction at work and at home and its relation to employee well-being at bedtime.

We focus on how the ex-ante design of policymaking processes affects the actual process with a focus on inclusion, and we discuss how it affects policy effectiveness and innovation system transformation. Our argument is that processes of policymaking must be inclusive to affect and transform innovation systems because a set of distributed actors, rather than ministries and innovation agencies, is the gatekeepers of change. From this perspective, inclusion is a precondition rather than an obstacle for transformation.

The use of public funds to directly or indirectly subsidise local professional team sports clubs (PTSCs) is often seen as warranted due to the PTSCs’ positive effects on local economic growth or (inbound) municipal migration. However, can PTSCs be associated with tangible effects at all? This question has never been answered properly in a European context. Based on data covering the 2008–2013 period, and using spatial panel regression models, this article examines this issue in relation to three dominant professional sports in Denmark: football (soccer), handball and ice hockey. The study finds effects for only one of the sports examined, with Danish handball clubs exercising a marginal effect on average income. Ice hockey's effect is negative and football remains insignificant in all models deployed. Concerning migration, negative effects are found in relation to female handball clubs. These findings are consistent with previous research and have implications for local sport policies and managers. Municipal politicians, public authorities or sport managers should no longer rationalise the use of public funds for local PTSCs on the assumption of (tangible) economic effects or population growth, as it appears to be an inefficient use of public money. If policy makers want to increase municipal income or inbound migration, they should engage themselves in developing more appropriate strategies. © 2016 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand","Denmark; Economic growth; Migration; Professional team sports",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002444251

Yet it remains unclear what impact the offshoring strategy has on the purchasing and supply organization (PSO) of these companies. In this paper the nature and type of changes offshoring organizations make within the PSO are examined, i.e. how new purchasing and supply management (PSM) structures and practices emerge, are maintained or are discarded as production operations are relocated. The processual perspective is used to analyze empirical data from a rich, in-depth case study within a global engineering company. Results suggest that in line with the law of requisite variety the PSO changes thoroughly when the company relocates its production activities through the captive offshoring mode, but does so in a more disjointed and non-linear manner than the current stage models would suggest. The offshoring process provides momentum for PSO change and influences where and how the change happens. We present five propositions for further research and conclude that offshoring provides managers with opportunities to: (i) change and influence the strategic direction of PSM in their organizations, and (ii) build viable strategies of retaining and managing knowledge and PSM competencies in global operations. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Captive offshoring; Case study research; Organization; Processual analysis; Procurement; Purchasing; Sourcing; Supply management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979995378

To build and control a strong brand image though, brand managers require a valid procedure to measure it. This article empirically compares the predictive validity of two measurement techniques to assess brand image: First, a brand-anchored discrete choice experiment (BDCE) which is based on a brand-anchored conjoint approach where brands serve as the levels for any attribute and which was originally introduced as ranting-based approach by Louviere and Johnson Journal of Retailing, 66, 359–382 (1990) and further extended to a BDCE by Eckert et al. International Journal of Research in Marketing, 29, 256–264 (2012). Second, a direct attribute rating (DAR) approach which is commonly used for commercial applications of brand image measurement. An empirical study using a representative sample of the German beer market shows that BDCE shows significantly higher levels of predictive validity (i.e., higher correlations with the actual market shares of the brands under investigation) than the widely used DAR method. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Brand image measurement; Brand-anchored conjoint; Direct attribute rating; Discrete choice experiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973121675

Additional suggestions are made concerning how multiple actors, levels, arenas and/or spheres of action, and logics might be accommodated. Finally, possibilities are outlined for how the strategic triangle might be adapted to complex policy fields in which there are multiple, often conflicting organizations, interests and agendas.

Nonetheless, the literature provides only scant knowledge about how cluster specialization transforms due to the globalization of production activities. The paper addresses this research gap based on a comparative case study of two Danish clusters, and by applying the literature on the global division of labour, global value chains and clusters. The main conclusion is that the specialization of clusters either changes or deepens in response to the globalization of production activities. However, which of these two outcomes it will be depends on the prioritization and localization of specific production activities in relation to the current cluster specialization, and on the governance executed by cluster lead firms. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cluster specialization; global division of labour; global value chain; Globalization; production","globalization; labor division; spatial distribution; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014756373

Statistical analysis shows that entrepreneurial competencies tend to be higher in the diaspora than in Iran, especially alertness to new business opportunities.

Entrepreneurship could be a part of the solution to the high unemployment rate in Iran. As a matter of fact, the Iranian diaspora seizes influential positions in technology, business, and financial industries in Europe and North America. Our study is to answer whether the place of residence has an impact on entrepreneurial competencies and entrepreneurial intention, and to examine the relation between entrepreneurial competencies and entrepreneurial intention by providing a comparative study of two groups-Iranian adults in Iran and Iranian diaspora. Using a sample of 3169 native-born Iranian adults in Iran and a sample of 361 Iranian diasporas who are fairly representative of the Iranian diaspora, we find that entrepreneurial competencies in the form of self-efficacy, risk-opportunity and role modeling are more prevalent among Iranian adults at home, but opportunity- alertness is less prevalent among Iranian adults at home. We also found that Iranian adults at home are more likely to start a business compared to the Iranian diaspora.

However, the lack of understanding of the true potentials for CE in many business sectors remains a challenge. In this study, we investigate the potential for reuse and recycling – the two key pathways promoted by CE – for waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) management. We empirically characterize household WEEE stream in order to explore a) the remaining functionality and reuse potential of end-of-life (EoL) products based on the current market conditions, and b) the recycling potential of EoL products based on their material compositions and existing WEEE treatment chain. For this, a total of 4704 kg WEEE within the collection fractions of ‘small appliances’ and ‘monitors’ was collected in 16 collection cages from eight civic amenity sites in Odense, Denmark. After determining the categorical distribution, all products were inspected individually and their functionality was tested. Further, selected products were dismantled in order to determine their material composition. Building on this investigation, the potential revenues from resale as well as from material recovery were estimated. With 22% and 7% of fully functional products in the fractions ‘small appliances’ and ‘monitors’ respectively, our results suggest resale value up to €247 per cage of the collected household WEEE. The existing WEEE management system, which focuses only on material recovery, does not exploit other EoL options. A better system designed to reclaim the remaining functionality and tailored material recovery from the EoL products thus has a large potential for increased revenue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; E-waste; End-of-life; Recycle; Refurbishment; Reuse","Economics; Electronic equipment; Industrial waste disposal; Oscillators (electronic); Recovery; Recycling; Sales; Waste management; Circular economy; End of lives; Functional products; Material compositions; Refurbishment; Reuse; Sustainable production; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Electronic Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016520988

As a result, Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) is becoming an important means by which business organizations prepare for sustainable development. Achieving sustainable consumption and production trends in supply chains is difficult due to the presence of several related barriers. In this contribution, we aim to identify and prioritize the barriers pertaining to the achievement of sustainable consumption and production trends in a supply chain context. In this work, firstly, 30 barriers related to implementing SCP trends in supply chain are recognized. These barriers are derived from a literature survey and from field and industrial experts' inputs. Secondly, an operational model is suggested using the fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process to prioritize the identified barriers with the goal of improving overall performance. The fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process helps determine the priority of concerns of the identified barriers under fuzzy surroundings. Inputs in this work are based upon an ancillary auto manufacturing firm in India. Research findings indicate that the Organizational barriers dimension obtains the highest priority (i.e., it serves as a key hurdle in achieving SCP trends in supply chains. This work also performs a sensitivity analysis to analyze the priority stability of the given SCP implementation focused barriers. This work presents the most important barrier to efficiently manage SCP initiatives. Accordingly, the proposed model is useful for regulatory bodies, policy makers, and industry managers/practitioners not only to recognize a set of related hurdles they will reasonably encounter, but also to provide a means by which to structure their efforts for the effective accomplishment of SCP trends in a supply chain context. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Multi criteria decision making; Supply chain management; Sustainable consumption and production","Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Barriers; Business organizations; Consumption patterns; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Multi criteria decision making; Organizational barriers; Sustainable consumption; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016488166

The article, therefore, aims to shed light upon how successful creative teams network: locally (local buzz) and/or globally (global pipelines). The contemporary literature on economic geography underlines the importance of the local scene and of geographical proximity for the creative industries, such as the music industry. The illustrative cases presented here–considered to be superstars in terms of their record sales–provide evidence that if local networks and buzz are present in the home localities of the bands, as is common in urban environments, they take advantage of these collaboration possibilities. However, bands located in smaller more peripheral localities can substitute for the lack of local buzz with global pipelines. Consequently, the results suggest that, for successful bands, the importance of local buzz is not as marked as would be expected based on the earlier literature. Therefore, the findings challenge, at least to a certain degree, the views of the heightened importance of geographical proximity for the creative music industry: instead, superstars collaborate to a large extent through global pipelines. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Collaboration; creative industry; knowledge base; metal music; network; superstar",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013106465

We hypothesize also that technological uncertainty is a positive moderator in the decision to include a grant-back clause, if the licensed technology is close to either the licensee's or the licensor's core technologies. We employ a hierarchical nested decision model to test the hypotheses on a sample of 397 licensed technologies.

This conceptual article addresses this lacuna by asking, how does organization design structure relationships in distributed innovation systems, including interactions between the “visible hand” of the manager and the “crowd” of distributed innovation? The purpose of this article is to shift the unit of analysis of organization design from the individual firm to networks of actors providing a framework to study how design organizes distributed innovation systems. In order to do so, three design mechanisms (interface design, the design of participatory architectures, and the design of evaluative infrastructures) are proposed through which firms and other network actors organize their encounter in “the open” and through which they manage communication, coordination of tasks, and control in distributed innovation systems. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","crowds; distributed innovation; organization design; organization theory; search; strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019141689

Research on gender and creative labour typically identifies external, systemic and structural causes for gender inequality in media industries. In contrast, I argue that genres, by virtue of their internal, structural and discursive patterning, play a constitutive role in regulating media producers’ gendered professional identities, shaping their struggle for recognition and structuring their economic sustainability. Rather than being merely outcomes of production processes, genres shape gender inequality: They possess gendering power that influences how media producers work, think and feel. Gendering and gendered genre norms that privilege ‘masculine’ over ‘female’ values are so hard-wired in occupational practice and professional codes of conduct that the genre itself becomes a control and boundary ascription mechanism that implicitly governs, sustains and reproduces gendered identity formation, career aspirations and biographical standing. Drawing on in-depth interviews with female producers of Scandinavian crime fiction, globally branded as Nordic Noir, I examine how female writers in Denmark have coped with and experienced the gendering effect of the genre in which they work and to which they are financially beholden. I also tease out the ways in which crime fiction, a masculine genre, causes anxiety of authorship and affects female producers’ identity and boundary work. This focus on the gendering power of genres may potentially help us understand the gender disparities in media industries – disparities that endure despite efforts at policing fair access and equal opportunity. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Creative labour; crime fiction; female crime fiction writers; gender; gender inequality; genre; media work; Nordic Noir; professional authorship; Scandinavian publishing field",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019130457

I then calibrate an agent-based model of search to analyse and interpret the findings from the experimental setup and discuss implications for organizational search.

This contradiction is tested using multiple experiments embedded in a large, nationally representative sample of Danish citizens. The results stress three differences between statistical and episodic data. Citizens have strong preferences for statistical data when asked to evaluate an organization. However, episodic information has in some instances a stronger impact on citizens’ evaluations of an organization and often is more emotionally engaging than statistics. Finally, when asked to immediately recall recent performance information about public services, citizens report more elaborate information about personalized stories and experiences than about statistics.

We investigate the dynamics of CSR in China through the interplay of the global and national societal pressures and mediating and even leading roles played by the State and the Party.

Generic predictive models based on past launches may provide only crude historic data which are unsuited for distinctive, innovative products. This paper investigates the role of online communities in providing pre-launch data to predict post-launch sales. We argue that levels of awareness, word-of-mouth, expectations, and adoption intention prevailing within an online community for an upcoming product have an independent direct effect on the product's future sales. Additionally, we test the complementarity effect of these community variables by introducing a higher order construct called Pre-release Community Buzz, to demonstrate the incremental explanatory power of using pre-launch community variables to predict post-launch sales. Data for community variables were collected from a movie-based online community, and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). We found strong support for both direct and complementarity effects of community variables in predicting a movie's opening week sales. We also found that community variables mediate the effects of generic predictor variables such as MPAA ratings, star cast, production budget and competition on opening week sales. Tests for robustness demonstrated the value of community variables. Models which included community variables had higher predictive power than those without.

This paper analyzes two alternative exploitation pathways: energy and protein production. The first pathway is based on anaerobic digestion of seaweed which is converted into biogas, for production of electricity and heat, and digestate, used as fertilizer; the second pathway uses seaweed hydrolysate as a substrate for cultivation of heterotrophic microalgae. As a result the seaweed sugars are consumed while new proteins are produced enhancing the total output. We performed a comparative Life Cycle Assessment of five scenarios identifying the critical features affecting resource efficiency and environmental performance of the systems with the aim of providing decision support for the design of future industrial scale production processes. The results show that all scenarios provide environmental benefits in terms of mitigation of climate change, with biogas production from dried Laminaria digitata being the most favorable scenario, quantified as −18.7102 kg CO2 eq./ha. This scenario presents also the lowest consumption of total cumulative energy demand, 1.7104 MJ/ha, and even resulting in a net reduction of the fossil energy fraction, −1.9104 MJ/ha compared to a situation without seaweed cultivation. All scenarios provide mitigation of marine eutrophication thanks to bioextraction of nitrogen and phosphorus during seaweed growth. The material consumption for seeded lines has 2–20 times higher impact on human toxicity (cancer) than the reduction achieved by energy and protein substitution. However, minor changes in cultivation design, i.e. use of stones instead of iron as ballast to weight the seeded lines, dramatically reduces human toxicity (cancer). Externalities from the use of digestate as fertilizer affect human toxicity (non-cancer) due to transfer of arsenic from aquatic environment to agricultural soil. However concentration of heavy metals in digestate does not exceed the limit established by Danish regulation. The assessment identifies seaweed productivity as the key parameter to further improve the performance of the production systems which are a promising service provider of environmental restoration and climate change mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biobased economy; Biogas; Life Cycle Assessment; Macroalgae; Proteins; Seaweed","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Diseases; Ecodesign; Economics; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Heavy metals; Proteins; Seaweed; Substrates; Toxicity; Bio-based; Climate change mitigation; Comparative life cycle assessment; Environmental performance; Environmental restoration; Industrial-scale production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Macro-algae; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016050799

This study aims at developing a comprehensive theoretical model to explain consumer outcomes for collaborative consumption. It develops and tests a structural equation model using partial least squares path modelling and survey data collected from a car-sharing website. The results suggest that consumer intentions to rent are driven primarily by perceived economic, environmental and social benefits through the mediator of perceived usefulness, and enjoyment, in turn driven by sense of belonging to the sharing community. Interestingly, social influence did not play a role. When making word-of-mouth recommendations, in addition to these factors, consumers also take website trust into account, underpinned by the structural assurances of the website.

We incorporate existing research with a process perspective of acquisitions in order to present trade-offs, and consider the influence of both stakeholders and the pre-deal-completion context on acquisition speed, as well as the organization's capabilities to facilitating that speed. Observed trade-offs suggest both that acquisition speed often requires longer planning time before an acquisition and that associated decisions require managerial judgement.

The internationalisation process can be a one-off transfer of authority to international institutions or an ongoing process. In the latter situation, the level of internationalisation may be gradually increased by expanding the regulatory scope of the regime or by deepening it. However, internationalisation processes may also involve stalemate or even reversal. How do domestic policy makers respond to such non-linear internationalisation? To answer this question, this paper analyzes the relationship between developments in the GATT and WTO farm trade negotiations and the reform trajectory of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) from the early 1990s to 2013. Until 2008, the EU gradually changed the support instruments of the CAP to limit their trade distorting impact. After the Doha Round stalled in 2008, international trade policy concerns were downgraded and domestic concerns took priority in the 2013 reform. © 2016 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","CAP; internationalisation; policy reform; trade policy; WTO",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992491580

In this study the intersection of these trends is examined through a content analysis of 112 publicly available social media policies from the largest corporations in the world. The extent to which social media policies facilitate and/or constrain the communicative sensibilities and values associated with contemporary notions of CSR is considered. Overall, findings indicate that a large majority of policies, regardless of sector or national headquarters, increasingly inhibit communicative tenets of contemporary CSR (i.e., free speech, collective information sharing, and stakeholder engagement/dialogue) and thereby diminish employee negotiation and participation in the social responsibilities of corporations. Moreover, policies generally enact organizational communication practices that are contrary to international CSR guidelines (e.g., the UN Global Compact and other international agreements). Findings suggest that social media policies represent a relatively unrecognized development in the institutionalization of CSR communicative norms and practices that call into question the promising affordances of social media for the inclusion of various voices in the public negotiation of what constitutes corporate social responsibility. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Boundary permeability; Communication rights; Corporate social responsibility; Dialogic processes; Employee communication; Social media policies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936885376

Using individual studies from leading scholars in a variety of disciplines and countries, this book identifies the global pressures behind these trends. It focuses on the debates surrounded the commercialization of business schools, and the rise of different methods of measuring their success. In their unique approach, the authors and editors discuss the impact of the confrontation between the timeless values embodied by Minerva, the Roman goddess of Wisdom, and the hard realities of competition and corporatization in modern society.

The hypotheses have been tested using data from a sample of 150 environmental management system ISO 14001 certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia through the census sampling approach. The results of the empirical test using LISREL Version 8.70 for the structural equation modeling support the fundamental explanation of the influence of the institutional forces towards the adoption of closed-loop supply chain activities and the effectiveness that can be reaped by the manufacturing firms from their adoption. These findings extend the prior research through the verification from the empirical survey on the importance of product returns in the adoption of closed-loop supply chain activities, which eventually impacts the firm's effectiveness in the reverse supply chain. The findings also help managers to understand the factors that can improve the outcome of the adoption of closed-loop supply chain activities by intensifying the extent of involvement in product returns, which provides a valuable insight about a significant predictor of firm performance in reverse flow chains. © 2017","Activities; Closed-loop supply chains; Effectiveness; Product returns; Reverse supply chains","Environmental management; Environmental management systems; Information management; Manufacture; Surveys; Activities; Closed-loop supply chain; Effectiveness; Product returns; Reverse supply chains; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015745173

The aim of the research presented in this chapter is to identify different types of design-time and run-time ASRs of the cloud-based systems, provide an ASRs classification scheme and present a framework to manage the requirements' variability during life cycle of the cloud-based systems. We have used a multifaceted research approach to address the ASRs identification, classification, and change management challenges. We have explored findings from systematic as well as structured reviews of the literature on quality requirements of the cloud-based systems including but not limited to security, availability, scalability, privacy, and multi-tenancy. We have presented a framework for requirements classification and change management focusing on distributed Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) systems as well as complex software ecosystems that are built using PaaS and SaaS, such as Tools as a Service (TaaS). We have demonstrated applicability of the framework on a selected set of the requirements for the cloud-based systems. The results of the research presented in this chapter show that key quality requirements of the cloud-based systems, for example, multi-tenancy and security, have a significant impact on how other quality requirements (such as scalability, reliability, and interoperability) are handled in the overall architecture design of a cloud-based system. It is important to distinguish tenant-specific run-time architecturally significant quality requirements and corresponding cloud-based systems' components so that run-time status of the tenant-specific architecture quality requirements can be monitored and system configurations can be adjusted accordingly. For the systems that can be used by multiple tenants, the requirements change management framework should consider if the addition or modification (triggered by a specific tenant) of a quality requirement can impact quality requirements of other tenants, and whether or not a trade-off point should be introduced in the architecture (corresponding to the requirements). The trade-off point can also be referred as a variability point, that is, a compromise has to be made among the number of quality requirements and only some of the requirements can be satisfied. System analysts and software architects can use the proposed taxonomy and the management framework for identifying relevant quality requirements for multi-tenant cloud-based systems, for analyzing impact of changes in the requirements on the overall system architecture, and for managing variability of the architecturally significant requirements. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Architecturally significant requirements (ARSs); Cloud computing; Platform as a service (PaaS); Requirements classification requirements change management architecture quality; Software as a service (SaaS)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054776709

We argue that, over time, public administration reacts to self-produced complexity by developing higher and higher orders of decision-making resulting in a form of decision-making that deconstructs the very difference between decision premises and decision.

The answer will be grounded in theoretical and empirical insights from recent research, conducted to develop a method for change management in Danish emergency management organizations. The theoretical insight builds on Lewin’s field theory in arguing that change processes must derive from the way in which individuals collectively perceive the situation. To respect this argument, the methodological design must concentrate on the way employees perceive changes. Another invention of Lewin proved to be relevant in this regard, notably action research. The application of a dialogical action research method resulted in rich empirical data, which proved the relevance of Lewin’s theoretical constructs and fed forward to newer theoretical perspectives on change, which have all in some respect revived Lewin’s original thoughts, particularly on the importance of social interaction and group structures for successful organizational change.

The study adopted a qualitative approach utilising in-depth interviews with 12 key informants from 6 MFT organisations in Tanzania, Mexico, Jordan and Vietnam. The results reveal that MFT providers rely on an experiential learning process to educate tourists. However, as part of this learning process, MFT initiatives are located on a continuum, constituting those initiatives designed to increase tourists’ compassion and philanthropic actions (i.e. ‘thin’ GC) through to those initiatives seeking to build solidarity and global discussions between tourists in order to challenge the structures that perpetuate global injustice (i.e. ‘thick’ GC). These results highlight the diversity of tourism providers’ perspectives pertaining to GC, the effect diversity has on the design of tourism initiatives and the resultant outcomes of GC education utilising ethical tourism. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","education; experiential learning; Global citizenship; microfinance tourism; provider perspective",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014774703

In this article, we analyze whether local managers—the primary enforcers of external interventions—affect how employees perceive a command system and thereby affect employee intrinsic motivation. Using a multilevel dataset of 1,190 teachers and 32 school principals, we test whether principals’ use of “hard,” “mixed,” or “soft” actions to enforce a command system (obligatory teacher-produced student plans) is associated with teacher intrinsic motivation. Results show that teachers experiencing “hard” enforcement actions have lower intrinsic motivation than teachers experiencing “soft” enforcement actions. As expected by motivation crowding theory, part of this association is mediated by teachers’ student plan requirement perception. These findings support the motivation crowding argument that employee intrinsic motivation depend on the employees’ need for self-determination.

Specifically, in the study of political marketing, a burgeoning set of research has encircled various cases and conceptions. However, the brand concept seeks to harbor a variety of political events, just like a sponge soaking up different kinds of meaning in different kinds of surroundings. This tendency makes it hard to accumulate knowledge because demarcations between various brand perspectives in many cases are implicit, which can impede the clarity and precision in our studies. Against this backdrop, we identify a gap in the political brand literature: a study conducting an overall conceptual inquiry. As such, it is first argued that we need a thorough analysis of the foundation of the political brand concept to uncover the presuppositions underlying the different usages of the concept. Second, we carry out a systematic review of the brand literature on voters and parties.

However, despite the empirical and theoretical evidence supporting the use of MICE, researchers in the social sciences often resort to inferior approaches unnecessarily risking erroneous results. The complexity of the decision process when encountering missing data may be what is discouraging potential users from adopting the appropriate technique. In this article, we develop straightforward step-by-step graphical guidelines on how to handle missing data based on a comprehensive literature review. It is our hope that these guidelines can help improve current standards of handling missing data. The guidelines incorporate recent innovations on how to handle missing data such as random forests and predictive mean matching. Thus, the data analysts who already actively apply MICE may use it to review some of the newest developments. We demonstrate how the guidelines can be used in praxis using the statistical program R and data from the European Social Survey. We demonstrate central decisions such as variable selection and number of imputations as well as how to handle typical challenges such as skewed distributions and data transformations. These guidelines will enable a social science researcher to go through the process of handling missing data while adhering to the newest developments in the field. © 2017. ACPIL.

This article investigates how classroom routines and rituals impact on entrepreneurship education in order to problematize how existing classroom environments may hinder critical learning experiences from taking place. This article builds on extensive insights from six cohorts of students at two Scandinavian universities over a 4-year period (2012–2015). The data were procured using an experiential–explorative research approach in which the researchers were personally involved in reflective processes as co-learners. The findings illustrate how educators can use rituals actively to change how students learn. However, students are very wary of embracing new structures and rituals; indeed, some feel so comfortable with the old rituals that they would prefer not to change from being receivers of knowledge to co-creators of the learning situation. It is therefore important to exchange existing rituals with new ones that enhance the feeling of safety and involve the students in creating the change. This is achieved through scaffolding and setting up ritual markers, which are continuously repeated. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","enterprise education; markers; rituals; routines; scaffolds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019722399

The review shows three main trends. First, trade unions are converging into similar strategies of revitalisation. The ‘organising model’ has spread far beyond the Anglo-Saxon countries and is now commonplace for unions as a way to reach new worker constituencies. Thus, even in ‘institutionally secure’ countries like Germany and the Nordic countries, unions are employing organising strategies while at the same time trying to defend their traditional strongholds of collective bargaining and corporatist policy-making. Second, research has shown that used strategies are not a panacea for success for unions in countries that spearheaded revitalisation. This finding points to the importance of supportive institutional frameworks if unions are to regain power.

Despite these volumes of research, very little has been written about the process of implementing a corporate language and even less about the employee perspective. The article contributes to the field of language in cross-cultural management by exploring when and why corporate language policies encounter resistance among employees. The study uses observational and focus group data to investigate reactions to a new corporate language policy in one Danish MNC. Drawing on sociolinguistic stancetaking theory and ethnographic methods, the study seeks to understand how contextual factors influence employees' stances towards the introduction of English as a corporate language. English language competence, the local linguistic context and different temporal perspectives are found to be key factors. The study suggests that new language policies are likely to be resisted when they are introduced to support a long-term strategic goal but lack immediate relevance in the daily life of employees. These results have implications beyond the scope of corporate language policies but reach into the study of the implementation of strategic organizational changes more generally with the suggestion that understanding employees' local context and outlook is necessary for management to successfully implement change in the organization. © The Author(s) 2017.","Corporate language; focus groups; language competence; language policy; organizational change; policy implementation; stancetaking",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018305276

This study focuses on interorganizational boundary-spanning activities in the context of global information technology (IT) development projects from the rare perspective of Indian vendor managers in one of the world’s largest IT service companies. It draws on a qualitative study of a collaborative partnership and focuses on the key boundary spanners who are responsible for developing trustful and sustainable client relationships and coordinating highly complex projects. We analyze vendor managers’ narratives of their collaboration with a European client in a long-term project, which is presented as a strategic partnership in an outsourcing 3.0 mode. The study offers a rich and conceptualized account of those managers’ boundary-spanning activities and a context-sensitive understanding of their boundary work. The study applies Bourdieu’s concept of capital (economic, cultural, social, and symbolic) not only in its analysis of the two powerful partners but also in its discussion of the boundary-spanning activities that are reported. The analysis demonstrates the coexistence of transactive and transformative modes of collaboration in the studied case. It reveals both the importance of partner status and the impact of that status on the forms of boundary-spanning activities in which the partners engage. Finally, this study suggests new research questions that will promote an understanding of both transactive and transformative boundary spanning and the reciprocity of boundary-spanning activities between vendor and client in a global collaborative partnership. © The Author(s) 2017.","Emerging market MNC; Qualitative research; Status asymmetry; Transformative mode of collaboration; Vendor perspective",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018295941

It then shows that the current scholarly discourse around corporate sustainability management - as reflected in environment management (EM), corporate social responsibility (CSR), and corporate political activity (CPA) - mostly favors an instrumental perspective on sustainability. Sustainable business practices are viewed as anthropocentric and are conceptualized as a means to achieve competitive advantage. Based on these observations, we speculate about what corporate sustainability management might look like if it applied ethical orientations that emphasize the intrinsic value of nature. This discussion also includes an introduction to two articles in this special section focused on the role of the environmental manager and sustainability standards, both of which offer paths for incorporating intrinsic valuation of the environment into sustainability management.

In this article, we draw on a research tradition that views communication as constitutive of organization to emphasize the significance of communicative mechanisms that stimulate organizational openness in the application of standards.

Although ample research has investigated the determinants of consumption of organic foods in private households, such consumption in institutional settings raises questions of citizen support rather than consumer choice. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to analyse the determinants of citizen support with regard to increasing the share of organic produce in public catering. A model is proposed that explains attitude to the procurement of organic produce in public kitchens by life values, attitudes to the environment, personal and social norms, and the use of organic produce for private household consumption. Data were collected by an online survey representative of the overall population in terms of major demographics in Denmark (n = 978). Results indicate that personal norms regarding the use of organic food affect attitudes toward the use of organic produce in institutional settings, and that this effect is partly mediated by own purchase of organic products, indicating a spillover effect from private to public practices. Collectivistic values and, to a lesser extent, individualistic values affect personal and social norms on using organic produce, partly mediated by attitude to the environment. The authors add a new aspect to the discussion of spillover effects among different forms of pro-environmental behaviours and suggest that measures to promote sustainable behaviours in the public and private sector may reinforce each other. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Institutional catering; Organic food consumption; Policy acceptance; Spillover","Food supply; Population statistics; Purchasing; Societies and institutions; Determinants of consumption; Environmental policy; Institutional catering; Institutional setting; Organic foods; Public and private sector; Spillover; Sustainable behaviours; Environmental protection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014806460

He calls for an increased interaction between different value spheres in social science, because ‘the flourishing of each depends on the flourishing of all.’ To ensure this interaction, he proposes that we pay better attention to the micro-politics of academic lives, not least their historical, geographical and biographical specificity. The current article contributes to this agenda, contextualized in the field of Organization Studies. It analyzes the vocational micro-politics of organization scholars, especially with a focus on historical and biographical specificity. Based on in-depth interviews with 15 senior scholars, many considered founding figures of Organization Studies, I analyze how they navigate value tensions in different historical periods. To understand historical differences, the article draws on a combination of Burawoy and Boltanski and Chiapello. To understand individual navigation of value spheres, I apply terms such as selective incorporation, decoupling, antagonism and double attribution. In the end, I discuss how some scholars navigate spheres to ensure mutual correction while others navigate them to enable opportunism. The latter is a tempting strategy for young scholars trying to survive extreme performance pressures today. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","academic careers; Burawoy; ethics; history; identity; memories; navigating tensions; organization theory; value sphere; Weber","attention; career; ethics; human; identity; interview; memory; politics; sociology; tension; vocation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012216704

Empirically, we draw on a case study of a North American grocery chain that is known for employing art-school graduates and other creative talents in creative (store artist) and non-creative shop-floor positions. The study shows that the brand is partly built outside–in through association with employees who embody brand-relevant characteristics in their identities and lifestyles. In return, those employees receive identity opportunities to validate their desired sense of self as ‘creative subject’.

We conduct a two-step empirical analysis using patent data from 1965 to 2012. Our findings suggest a process of co-evolution of firms' strategies and indicate that strong sectoral-specific patterns of eco-innovation are present in this sector from the mid-2000s onwards. For fuel cells technologies, however, we observe the formation of two antagonist patterns. A further econometric analysis is conducted and indicates that the positioning of the firms between these two groups is correlated with the firms' profit margins and the size of firms' patent portfolios. © 2016 The Authors","Automotive sector; Eco-innovation; Evolutionary dynamics; Fuel cell; Green economy; Sectoral patterns; Technological strategies","Automotive industry; Dynamics; Economics; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Automotive sector; Eco-innovation; Evolutionary dynamics; Green economies; Sectoral patterns; Technological strategies; Patents and inventions; automobile industry; econometrics; fuel cell; green economy; heterogeneity; industrial policy; innovation; policy analysis; strategic approach; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008239929

Comparing the first two groups we find that solely promoting sustainability does not lead to a change in sustainable behavior. However, once the monetary reward is linked to sustainable outcome measures, we find a significant positive effect on sustainable behavior.

Politics is often here presented as misrepresentation by the project maker who manipulates everyone else. This is where power is concentrated in the hands of the few. However, this approach may overlook another lateral version of politics by which power is plural and ubiquitous, and which, through Latour's notion of Dingpolitics, combines the questions ‘who has to be taken into account’ and ‘what has to be taken into account’. This brings the analysis further than stakeholder theory with its focus on abstract structural interests, towards articulated concerns about the objects that matter to people. Through analysis of the Italian system for stakeholder management—the so-called Conferenza di Servizi, which was organised according to stakeholder theory with an emphasis on representation of interested parties—this paper identifies the limitations of representation to predict the fate of a megaproject. Settlements based on interests are not able to capture all relevant actors and all relevant types of knowledge. In contrast to stakeholder theory, Dingpolitics explains project management as a process of finding out the multiple, evolving and sometimes indefinite contours of claims and concerns from many human and non-human actors by analysing both what actors are worried about and how their different concerns, ambitions and claims are composed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Dingpolitics; Megaproject; Project escalation; Stakeholder management","Project management; Dingpolitics; Human actor; Infrastructure project; Mega projects; Object oriented; Project escalation; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder theory; Social sciences; design method; politics; project management; research; stakeholder; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006080812

We revisit recent and classic datasets from technology forecasting data envelopment analysis (TFDEA) research and technometrics in light of a new visualization technique known as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). The technique is a nonlinear visualization technique for preserving local structure in high-dimensional spaces of data. The technique may be classified as a form of topological data analysis. Specifically, each point in the space represents a potential technological design or implementation, and each line segment in the space represents a local measure of technological improvement or degradation. We hypothesize five distinct kinds of performance development in technology within this space including the frontier, the fold, the salient, the soliton, and the lock-in. Then we examine the spaces to determine which kinds of development are the best explanations for the observed development. The technique is not extrapolative, and therefore cannot fully supplant existing technometric methods. Nonetheless, the approach offers a useful diagnostic to existing technometric methods, and may help advance theories of technological development. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","electric vehicles; t-distributed stochastic network embedding; technological evolution; Technometrics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994635644

Employees with large networks are therefore expected to help more in the workplace than those with small networks. However, large networks are also associated with cognitive costs, which may reduce the focal employee's ability to both recognize the need for help and engage in helping behaviours. For these reasons, the authors assert an inverted U-shaped relation between the size of an ego's social network and engagement in helping behaviour. However, high-quality relationships imply higher mutual understanding between the actors, and hence lower cognitive costs. In turn, the position (and threshold) of the curve between network size and interpersonal helping should be influenced by the quality of the relationship between the provider and the beneficiaries of help. Analysis of employee-level, single-firm data supports these ideas, providing preliminary evidence that quality of relationship compensates for the difficulties that may arise from having large social networks. © 2016 British Academy of Management",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993964567

We study the contractual choice of a coordinator to either centralize or delegate the investment decision in a three-stage chain. The analysis derives closed-form results for the economic performance of three decentralized contracting schemes under asymmetric information on investment cost, as well as the optimal full revelation results. The results show that the observed practice of tier-1 delegated investments leads to relatively poor performance because of underinvestment. We illustrate the findings with the Boeing 787 debacle.

The book explores, understands and theorises organisational practices as constructed through the activities of all organisational actors. Actors always act under presumptions of a specific actor-world-relation which they continuously construct, adjust and reconstruct in light of new experiences, contexts and communication. The outcome of the actor-world-relation is a reality construction. The reality construction may function successfully or it may be hampered by fictitious and illusionary elements, due to missing or faulty actor-world relations. The thesis is that four dimensions of reality - facts, possibilities, values and communication - must be integrated in the actor-world-relation if the construct is to form a successful basis for effective, functioning actions. Drawing on pragmatic constructivism, the book provides concepts and ideas for studies regarding actors and their use of management accounting models in their construction of organized reality. It concentrates on researching and conceptualizing what creates functioning reality construction. It develops concept and methods for understanding, analysing and managing the actors' reality constructions. It is intended for people who do research on or work actively with developing management accounting. © 2017 Taylor & Francis. All rights reserved.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028011465

In this study, we evaluate the costs of a gradual transition towards a new power system in which the oldest coal plants are replaced with low-carbon power plants. We developed the Wind Energy Integration Cost Advisor Model (WEICAM) to analyze different strategies for this energy transition and determine the most cost-effective roadmap, with and without externalities. The test case is the PJM Interconnection, one of the power systems in the United States with the largest fraction of coal. Different strategies to replace coal plants are evaluated: 1) installing only new, high-efficiency, natural-gas combined-cycle plants (control case), 2) installing new wind farms in combination with natural-gas combined-cycle plants used as spinning reserves (wind case), and 3) same as the wind case but boosting up the production of existing baseload plants that work with a capacity factor between 50% and 60%–80% before installing new wind farms. All three strategies have similar costs (∼54 $/MWh), but the latter is slightly more cost-effective, with a total of 19 GW of coal capacity decommissioned and an increase in the levelized cost of electricity from 49.1 to 53.6 $/MWh (without externalities). In addition, selecting the windiest sites – even far away from the PJM region – is cheaper than selecting local but less windy sites. When externalities due to human health and environmental pollution are accounted for, the two wind-based strategies become the most advantageous, reducing the levelized cost below 104 $/MWh from the initial 110 $/MWh. We conclude that adding new wind farms from the windiest locations, accompanied by a better management of existing plants and a small addition of new natural-gas reserve capacity, is the most economic and the most environmentally responsible pathway to replace retiring coal-fired power plants in PJM. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coal plants; Decommission; Externalities; Levelized cost of electricity; PJM; Wind energy integration","Carbon; Climate change; Coal; Combined cycle power plants; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum deposits; Pollution; Proven reserves; Small power plants; Wind power; Coal plants; Decommission; Externalities; Levelized cost of electricities; Wind energy integration; Electric power system economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013678100

While the Multi Regional Input-Output analysis has been accepted by the scientific community as an alternative to the IPCC accounting, some concerns arise from the feasibility and the actual implementation of this methodology. In this paper, we apply a simplified framework recently introduced by Caro et al. (2014a), called NCI (National Carbon Intensity) method, and estimate the total CO2 emissions due to consumption in 175 countries during the period 2008–2012, with a focus on the Mediterranean area. We estimate CO2 emissions embodied in trade, assigning emission responsibility on the basis of each country's demand. Globally in 2012, 8129 Mt CO2 emissions were related to goods produced in one country and consumed outside its boundaries. A relevant example is the export from China to consumers located in the USA, Japan, and Germany. A focus on the Mediterranean area, that resulted as a net importer of CO2 embodied in traded goods, identifies the export of emissions from Italy and Spain to France and from Libya and Algeria to Italy as the dominant flows. The NCI method provides a realistic picture of emissions due to consumption that differs from high resolution Multi Regional Input-Output database by less than 10%. The method can be largely adopted as a more feasible preliminary step towards consumption-based emission accounting and responsibility assignment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Consumption-based accounting; Emissions embodied in trade; GHG emissions; Mediterranean area; Production versus consumption","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; International trade; Accounting procedures; Carbon intensity; GHG emission; High resolution; Input output analysis; Mediterranean areas; Scientific community; Scientific literature; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013668646

These DCs serve as a backbone for the firms to achieve competitive advantages in contemporary ever-changing markets. The present study focuses on exploring the impact of the DCs on the firm's performance, by offering a review of literature to identify the various associated DCs and performance measures of a firm cited in peer reviewed journals. The impact of the collected DCs on the enhancement of firms’ performance is then analyzed with the help of six performance measures identified from the literature. First, through a questionnaire survey with industrial experts from south India as respondents, the initial list of 77 DCs is confined to a list of 40 essential DCs. Second, the shortlisted 40 DCs are grouped under six performance measures; a logical interpretation of which DC will best enhance which performance measure was selected with the help of the industrial experts. Third, Analytical Hierarchy Process pair-wise comparisons of the seven groups of DCs are done to identify the influential DCs in each of the seven performance measure categories. Priority weights and rankings are obtained both within the category and globally. Finally, a Grey-Analytical Hierarchy Process is used to get a better understanding of the overall impact of the DCs in enhancing the performance measures of the firm for a sustained competitive advantage. The obtained results help industrial managers to identify specific influential DCs for each performance measure category by overcoming the limitations of few experts through the application of the grey multi criteria decision making system.

This paper uses an energy system model ANSWER-MARKAL to analyse the role of electric vehicles (EV) in India. The modelling assessment spans the period 2010 to 2050 and analyses future EV demand in India under three scenarios: i) a ‘Reference’ scenario which includes the continuation of existing EV policies as outlined in India's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC); ii) a ‘EV policy’ scenario which, in line with India's INDCs, follows targeted supply-side push policies for EVs, but without the budget constraints; and iii) a ‘low carbon’ scenario which uses an exogenous price for CO2 in line with the global target of 2 °C temperature stabilization. The scenarios analysis delineates penetration of EVs and their co-benefits as well as co-costs. The co-benefits relate to local air quality, national energy security and CO2 emissions in India whereas the co-costs (risks) are related to sourcing of raw materials for batteries and battery reprocessing and disposal. The findings show that: i) in the reference scenario, the EVs 2-wheelers will achieve a significant share by 2050. Electric 4-wheelers though would have a small share even in 2050; ii) EV push policies though lead to significant diffusion of electric 2- wheelers in India by 2030. These policies enhance diffusion of electric 4-wheelers only if financial incentives are sustained in the long-term, iii) the application of global carbon price on the Indian economy in the 2° C stabilization scenario increases competitiveness of EVs and results in near total share of electric 2-wheelers by 2030 and a sizable share of electric 4-wheelers by 2050. The high and rising carbon price in low carbon scenario cause deep decarbonisation of electricity and enables EVs to deliver deep cut in CO2 emissions. The results show asymmetry in the impacts of national and global policies on co-benefits from EV. The EV supply-push policies deliver moderate benefits vis-à-vis air pollution and energy security indicators but make insignificant contribution CO2 emissions reduction. On the other hand, the global carbon price in the global 2° C stabilization scenario delivers sizable co-benefits vis-à-vis all three indicators. This asymmetry reveal important policy insights: i) the policy sequencing is vital to gain co-benefits, ii) EV technology push policies are good for creating early domestic market for a clean vehicle technology but they may not deliver sizable co-benefits vis-à-vis CO2 emissions which are global externalities, and iii) implementing strong climate policies early would lead to EVs delivering high co-benefits, in case of India, vis-à-vis all three indicators. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 mitigation; Cobenefits; Electric vehicle; Electricity demand","Air pollution; Air quality; Budget control; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economics; Electric automobiles; Electric batteries; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy security; Forestry; Pollution; Risk perception; Secondary batteries; Stabilization; Vehicles; Cobenefits; Electricity demands; Emissions reduction; Energy system model; Financial incentives; Passenger transport; Scenarios analysis; Temperature stabilization; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995531387

The aim of the study was to describe and compare the inspection practices, within the construction industry, between the Danish and Swedish Work Environment Authorities. A mixed-method approach was employed combining observations of inspections, interviews with inspectors and questionnaire responses from inspected workplaces. The primary role of both Danish and Swedish inspectors was as controllers. A minor role was as experts. A third role of being a sounding board was only identified in a few instances in Sweden. Autonomy-supportive tactics were employed more regularly in Sweden while coercive tactics were more widespread in Denmark. Negative behaviour on behalf of the inspected party was also more widespread in Denmark while positive behaviour was more widespread in Sweden. Questionnaire data revealed that the inspected Swedish companies had a significantly more positive perception of the inspectors and the benefits of the inspections. There were differences in the enforcement practices of the Danish and Swedish inspectors, which may lead to greater adherence to health and safety regulations in Sweden. © 2016 The Author(s).

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of AM on spare parts supply chain. Three supply chain scenarios are investigated in this paper, namely conventional supply chain, centralised AM-based supply chain and distributed AM-based supply chain. Based on system dynamics simulations, this paper specifically compares three supply chain scenarios, in terms of total variable cost and carbon emission. The results show the spare part supply chain utilising AM is indeed superior to the traditional one in sustainable performance. It is also expected that AM can facilitate the spare parts supply chain to achieve more economic benefits along with its development. To our knowledge, this paper is one of the early studies that explores the impact of AM on supply chain performance and quantitatively examines the superiority of utilising AM in spare parts supply chain. Some suggestions are also provided to help managers adopting AM in their spare parts supply chains. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacturing; advanced manufacturing technology; comparative study; spare parts supply chain; supply chain dynamics; system dynamics","3D printers; Carbon; Manufacture; System theory; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Comparative studies; Spare parts supply; Supply chain dynamics; System Dynamics; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988360187

Building lifespan is important to LCA, since results must be normalized on an annualized basis for comparison. However, the scientific literature shows that issues of building lifespan are inadequately addressed. The aim of this research is therefore to explore how environmental impact from building components is affected by building lifespans of 50, 80, 100 and 120 years in a Danish context. LCAs are undertaken for 792 parametric variations of typical construction solutions, covering all primary building components and based on contemporary practice. A full statistical analysis is carried out, which shows a significant statistical correlation between changes in building lifespan and environmental impact for all primary building components, except windows/rooflights. On average, a building lifespan of 80 years reduces environmental impact by 29%, 100 years by 38%, and 120 years by 44%, all in relation to a lifespan of 50 years. The results show that if construction professionals and policy-makers use short building lifespans, then resource allocation to reduce environmental impact during procurement may become disproportionately focused on the construction contra operational phases of the lifecycle. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Building lifespan; environmental impact; life cycle assessment; primary building components; statistical analysis","Building components; Buildings; Construction; Life cycle; Statistical methods; Construction professionals; Construction solutions; Contemporary practices; Environmental concerns; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life span; Scientific literature; Statistical correlation; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983516185

Possibilities and hindrances to combine social improvements and competition in the development of human resources are discussed. During the last 10 years most European countries have increased investments in the development of human resources at work as a vehicle for social development. The public investment in training, rehabilitation and support for innovation has increased; and at the same time the labour market has been deregulated to remove obstacles for flexibility and business development.

The study supplements modern non-parametric density estimation methods where log-concavity plays a main role, as well as heavy-tailed diagnostics such as the mean excess plot. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Heavy-tailed; Log-concave; Mean excess function; Principle of a single big jump",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084298642

Methodology: We present the results of a study in which 1,642 participants aged 15 to 82 (mean 35.3; 51.9% females) were involved. Each respondent marked three to four brands from different categories of goods and services on a 20-item adjectival list for measuring brand personality. As a result, 6,548 descriptions of 224 brands from 46 categories were collected. Findings: Our analyses show that the structure of the differences among brand personalities on the Polish market can be described in terms of four dimensions: competence, spontaneity, subtlety, and egoism. The established dimensions explain 85% of the variance. A distribution of the results within the scales applied served as a basis for establishing specific norms for each of the four scales. Limitations: The norms established have a country-level character and are inclusively adequate and reliable for companies that purchase products and services on the Polish market. Originality: Our study presents a new, ecological approach to thinking about brands. Namely, it enables a more precise determination of the position of a certain brand in relation to many other competing brands and allows for a more efficient use of the potential for constructing brand personality. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

As a recreational activity, hunting stands apart from other forms of outdoor recreation like birdwatching in that it involves the pursuit and killing of wild animals. Today, it is in a tight spot. It has been criticized from animal ethics points of view, but it has also been commended as an activity which allows us to take responsibility for procuring our own food. The paper reports a national survey of the general public using an Internet-based questionnaire sent to a representative sample of the Danish public in 2012 (n=1001). Attitudes towards recreational hunting among the adult general public were examined in relation to gender, age, education, income and residence, association with hunters, hunting conditions, and wildlife value orientations. 43% of the general public had a positive attitude, 31% were indifferent, and 26% had a negative attitude to recreational hunting. Older respondents and rural residents had more positive attitudes towards hunting than younger and urban residents. Some of the conditions under which hunting occurs affected attitudes negatively, especially the hunting of farm-reared and released game birds, hunting organized as a group hunt, and single day leases of hunting grounds. Respondents with a “mutualist” wildlife value orientation had the most negative attitude towards hunting (39%), “distanced” respondents were the most indifferent (44%), and “utilitarians” were the most positive (61%). Assessing levels of public support for recreational hunting is important if we are to gauge whether hunting as a recreational and socio-cultural activity can be sustained. A rethink of hunting as part of the leisure industry should be considered, because the least positive attitudes were found in relation to the commercial aspect of hunting and this could result in tighter regulation with further effects on management practices. Management Implications The public opinions and public preferences concerning recreational hunting are complex. However, this study revealed some factors relevant for regulatory and managerial development in relation to outdoor recreation: age (younger respondents were least supportive of hunting), urbanisation (living in an urban environment enhanced negative attitudes), compatibility of recreational hunting with other outdoor leisure activities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Distanced; Europe; Hunting attitudes; Urbanized; Wildlife values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032075753

However, there are usually various different technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge; thus, it is difficult for decision-makers/stakeholders to select the most sustainable technology among multiple alternatives. This study aims at developing a generic multi-criteria decision support framework for sustainability assessment of the technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge. A generic criteria system including both hard and soft criteria in economic, environmental, social and technological aspects was developed for sustainability assessment. The improved analytic hierarchy process method, namely Best-Worst method, was employed to determine the weights of the criteria and the relative priorities of the technologies with respect to the soft criteria. Three MCDM methods including the sum weighted method, digraph model, and TOPSIS were used to determine sustainability sequence of the alternative technologies for the treatment of urban sewage sludge. Three technologies including landfilling, composting, and drying incineration have been studied using the proposed framework. The sustainability sequence of these three technologies determined by these three methods was obtained, and finally the priority sequence was determined as landing filling, drying incineration and composting in the descending order. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Best-worst method; Multi-criteria decision making; Sum weighted method; Sustainability assessment; TOPSIS; Urban sewage sludge","Decision making; Decision support systems; Health risks; Incineration; Sewage sludge; Waste incineration; Best-worst method; Multi criteria decision making; Sustainability assessment; TOPSIS; Weighted method; Sustainable development; analytical hierarchy process; decision making; multicriteria analysis; sewage; sludge; sustainability; waste technology; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028238549

However, such actions often conflict with existing regulatory, normative, or cultural-cognitive structures, preventing legitimation on a broad scale. This article shows how activist consumers initially tackle the problem of food waste through a practice-namely, dumpster diving-that is at odds with marketplace structures, leading to the practice's marginalization and somatization. However, through dialectical adaptation strategies that alter both the practice of dumpster diving and respective marketplace antecedents, the practice of foodsharing emerges, becomes legitimated, and contributes significantly to the primary goal of dumpster diving: the reduction of food waste. The author identifies goal congruency as the underlying mechanism that allows for this process of dialectical adaptation. This study contributes to the literature on sustainable behavior by showing how the process of dialectical adaptation has the potential to resolve trade-offs as experienced by public policy makers, companies, and consumers. Finally, this article examines a case in which consumers and companies resolve a public policy problem without regulatory intervention, by opting out of public policy. © 2017, American Marketing Association.","Consumer behavior; Ethics; Ethnography; Food waste; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021346229

Second, in Study 2, an ordinary least squares regression based on data collected from 233 real auditor-client dyads in Germany reveals that auditors’ identification-based trust is positively associated with their clients’ perception of the auditors’ professional skepticism. The identified coexistence of trust and professional skepticism in auditor-client dyads implies that regulatory measures that impede the evolution of trust between auditors and their clients will fail to enhance professional skepticism.

In this survey we give an overview of data-driven optimization problems in liner shipping. Research in liner shipping is motivated by a need for handling still more complex decision problems, based on big data sets and going across several organizational entities. Moreover, liner shipping optimization problems are pushing the limits of optimization methods, creating a new breeding ground for advanced modelling and solution methods. Starting from liner shipping network design, we consider the problem of container routing and speed optimization. Next, we consider empty container repositioning and stowage planning as well as disruption management. In addition, the problem of bunker purchasing is considered in depth. In each section we give a clear problem description, bring an overview of the existing literature, and go in depth with a specific model that somehow is essential for the problem. We conclude the survey by giving an introduction to the public benchmark instances LINER-LIB. Finally, we discuss future challenges and give directions for further research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Large scale optimization; Liner shipping; Logistics; Mathematical modelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014148369

Initially proposed within the scope of information systems (IS) research as a means of creating a deeper knowledge foundation for decision making regarding information technology (IT) innovations, it soon became broadly applied throughout IS research. To gain a better understanding of the evolved diversity of this concept, this paper reviews and analyzes extant IS research by means of (a) the investigated IS themes, (b) the purpose of using the concept, (c) the level of application of the concept, and (d) the tendency to focus either on mindfulness, mindlessness, or both. By synthesizing research findings, we derive a high-level IS mindfulness theory. We then propose future research opportunities, such as the explanation of the relationships between different levels of mindfulness, applying mindfulness to bridge the different phases of the software development process, and the identification of guidelines for designing information systems that facilitate mindfulness. As the first review on the application of mindfulness in IS research, we contribute to the overall understanding of mindfulness and address the four abovementioned dimensions from which mindfulness emerges in order to demonstrate that mindfulness provides a meaningful platform for generating knowledge. © 2017 The OR Society.","individual mindfulness; literature review; mindful organizing; organizational mindfulness","Bridges; Decision making; Information use; Software design; individual mindfulness; Is researches; Literature reviews; mindful organizing; Multi-dimensional analysis; Organizational mindfulness; Research opportunities; Software development process; Information systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014094241

They differ in terms of the individuals’ previous professional experience, educational background, and the time they needed to arrive in an executive position. By characterizing the backgrounds and career paths of SCEs, we show that supply chain management (SCM) is truly a cross-functional profession. Our findings suggest that previous staff responsibility appears to be a more important hiring criterion than extensive SCM experience.

In particular, many studies have highlighted the potential of social networks for early detection of epidemic outbreaks, due to their capability to transmit information faster than traditional channels, thus leading to quicker reactions of public health officials. Anyhow, the most of these studies have investigated only one or two diseases, and consequently to date there is no study in the literature trying to investigate if and how different kinds of outbreaks may lead to different temporal dynamics of the messages exchanged over social networks. Furthermore, in case of a wide variability, it is not clear if it would be possible to define a single generic solution able to detect multiple epidemic outbreaks, or if specifically tailored approaches should be implemented for each disease. To get an insight into these open points, we collected a massive dataset, containing more than one hundred million Twitter messages from different countries, looking for those relevant for an early outbreak detection of multiple disease. The collected results highlight that there is a significant variability in the temporal patterns of Twitter messages among different diseases. In this paper, we report on the main findings of this analysis, and we propose a set of steps to exploit social networks for early epidemic outbreaks, including a proper document model for the outbreaks, a Graphical User Interface for the public health officials, and the identification of suitable sources of information useful as ground truth for the assessment of outbreak detection algorithms. © 2017, Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management.","Document models; Epidemic intelligence; Knowledge management; Methods for responsive and agile organizations; Social network analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011596138

Using longitudinal matched employer–employee data from Denmark, the analysis reveals that a transition to entrepreneurship decreases individual's employment turnover tendency. Three explanations are identified and empirically explored: (i) job matching, (ii) labour market value, and (iii) personal commitment. Entrepreneurs appear to be more productive and thus better matched compared to wageworkers. However, they also appear to be locked in entrepreneurship because of their anticipated lower value in the labour market and because of their personal attachment to the venture. The counter-intuitive finding – entrepreneurship yields greater employment stability – only holds with respect to subsequent transitions to wagework and not for new venture founding. The results have implications for our understanding of entrepreneurial entry and labour market dynamics. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Employment turnover; Entrepreneurship; Job matching; Labour market value; Personal commitment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009893955

The approach draws novelty and usefulness insights from the creativity literature and combines these with novelty and market potential insights from the innovation literature. The resulting framework encompasses novelty of a product idea and its usefulness to the intended recipients, but with a distinct focus on the value to the firm that can be created through market potential. This set of criteria makes it possible to couple creative ideas for new products directly to potential innovation performance. For the study, industry and market experts made assessments of 106 student-generated projects; these assessments underline the distinctiveness of the three criteria and support the value of each criterion's independent role in assessing the innovation potential.

However, an international joint venture involves numerous actors in the market entry process. While emerging markets tend to feature complex institutional contexts and idiographic entry challenges, our study with a focus on emerging market presents two under-examined types of stakeholders as distinct social actors’ that affect internationalisation process: the transnational diaspora and civil society actors. It provides evidence of the reactive internationalisation of an MNE, showing how the transnational diaspora drove the MNE's internationalisation and how a civil society actor, in conjunction with a diaspora member, facilitated the creation of an international joint venture (IJV) in Bangladesh. This case study analyses and describes the stages of development, documenting how Norwegian Telenor, American Gonophone, Japanese Marubeni and Bangladeshi Grameen Bank created an IJV named Grameenphone in Bangladesh, and how diaspora and civil society actors made up the prime movers and organisational capability base for this process, which would not have happened without their market-driving and enabling influence. The findings illustrate the central role of transnational diaspora entrepreneurship and the related innovation, motivation, contextual intelligence, networking and funding that supported this emerging-market IJV development.

When crossing the Atlantic, the concept of diversity management merged with Danish universal welfare logics that offer a particular view on equality as sameness together with solidarity through corporate social responsibility. Drawing on 94 employee narratives about difference in a Danish workplace renowned for its diversity work, this article argues that a translation of the original American concept has taken place that turns diversity management into an ambiguous corporate activity when practised through Danish welfare logics. Paradoxically, corporate practices of social responsibility aimed at fostering equal opportunities obstruct successful labour-market integration, as differences are assimilated and marginalized rather than valued and respected. Economic redistribution is thus at the cost of recognition of difference contained in the business case of diversity. In this article we explore how difference can be reintroduced into the Danish welfare logics to balance the simultaneous need for redistribution and recognition of difference, which goes through aligning diversity management with critical scholarship by means of a norm-critical approach. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Difference; Diversity management; Ethnic minority; Recognition; Redistribution; Welfare",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007281373

However, making sense of the ‘big data’ in these communities is a complex analytical task. A systematic way of dealing with these data is needed to exploit their potential for boosting companies' innovation performance. We propose a method for analysing online community data with a special focus on identifying ideas. We employ a research design where two human raters classified 3,000 texts extracted from an online community, according to whether the text contained an idea. Among the 3,000, 137 idea texts and 2,666 non-idea texts were identified. The human raters could not agree on the remaining 197 texts. These texts were omitted from the analysis. The remaining 2,803 texts were processed by using text mining techniques and used to train a classification model. We describe how to tune the model and which text mining steps to perform. We conclude that machine learning and text mining can be useful for detecting ideas in online communities. The method can help researchers and firms identify ideas hidden in large amounts of texts. Also, it is interesting in its own right that machine learning can be used to detect ideas. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006761522

Though highly topical, there is little solid empirical knowledge of this issue, which calls for an inductive approach. We match a paired-respondent questionnaire survey with population-wide employer-employee data, and find evidence that the presence of female top managers is positively related to entrepreneurial outcomes in established firms. Yet, this relation is conditional on the proportion between male and female top managers. Another finding is that the overall proportion of women in the firm's workforce negatively moderates the relation between female top managers and entrepreneurial outcomes. We discuss various mechanisms that can explain these findings, and argue that they are best understood in terms of the dynamics of social categorization. Managerial summary: We investigate how companies benefit from having more women on the top-management team. We show that beyond a threshold level of female top managers, more women are associated with more entrepreneurial outcomes (more products and services profitably launched). However, this positive effect is weakened in firms that have many women in the workforce. These effects may be explained in terms of the ways employees mentally categorize managers and how this influences their work motivation. We find evidence for such an explanation.

Maximizing the AIRR sets stricter return requirements on money expenditures than classic profit maximization models and may describe more closely shipping investors׳ preferences. The resulting nonlinear model is linearized to ease computation. Based on data from a shipping company we compare a profit maximization model with an AIRR maximization model.

Our study investigates the effect of marketized state ownership on emerging market firms’ propensity to engage in foreign direct investment. We argue that firms with marketized state ownership may derive institutional competitive advantages from their dual responsiveness to shifting global market conditions and home government expectations which has a positive impact on their foreign investment decisions. However, such advantages are likely to vary in magnitude for firms with marketized state ownership at central and local levels of government due to different patterns of corporate restructuring. We predict that such ownership effects are contingent on firms’ affiliation to meso-level institutional structures such as state business groups which reallocate resources among members.

Using 8 years of data from publicly listed Nordic corporations, we show societal pressure to be one of the determinants of female directorship. Moreover, in some corporations, the director selection process may work to maintain “a traditional type of board”. In such boards, demographic diversity among male members appears to be associated with a lower share of female directors, although we cannot establish wether this reflects discrimination or a desire to maintain critical competencies. With this paper we add to the theoretical understanding of the factors underlying female board appointments by adopting an institutional theory lens to study female board representation. Viewing the demands for gender-balanced boards in terms of societal pressure for the de-institutionalization of the prevailing norms and practices, we highlight preferences for maintaining established practices as a potentially important barrier to institutional change. On these grounds, we conjecture on the relationship between the gender diversity of boards and other diversity dimensions. We suggest that a board room gender quota (if implemented) is supplemented by policies to ensure the transparency of board changes, in order to prevent the crowding out of other diversity dimensions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Board diversity; Board of directors; Corporate elite; Gender diversity; Gender quota",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930532205

The purpose is to analyse the processes and stakeholder interactions, which formed the basis for integrating resource efficiency requirements into the implementing measure for vacuum cleaners and the voluntary agreement for imaging equipment. Based on the analysis, the following recommendations were made on how to strengthen the focus on resource efficiency in the Ecodesign Directive. It is legally possible within the Ecodesign Directive to set requirements to resource efficiency, but a focus on the most significant environmental impact has often resulted in a focus on energy efficiency in the use phase. Therefore, the Ecodesign Directive should continue to target resource efficiency aspects but also consider environmental aspects with a large improvement potential in addition to the most significant environmental impact. For the introduction of resource efficiency requirements into the Ecodesign Directive, these requirements have to be included in the preparatory study. It is therefore recommended to broaden the scope of the Methodology for the Ecodesign of Energy-related products and the EcoReport tool and to develop the necessary resource efficiency indicators. A continued pressure from the stakeholders is also important, and a recommendation is therefore to continue the open ecodesign process and strengthen stakeholder consultations during the preparatory study. The Directorate-General for Energy and The Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs have the leadership of the main adopted product groups within the Ecodesign Directive. DG Environment is involved in the process and has a shared leadership of the preparatory study on washing machines and dishwashers.

Findings suggest that the implementation of the M-platform in addition to its intended purpose spawns a digital business model that allows the company to change its relations to distributors, retailers and customers enabling access to direct communication with end-users. However, the emerging new business model has the potential to change the organization entirely. This paper argues that although the emerging business model was indeed a success seen from a sales-, marketing-, innovative-, and relational perspective, it was perceived as a disaster from an organizational perspective. Consequently, top management abandoned the new platform.

However, the issue of whether the mechanism is motivational, as expected, has not been tested. This article finds support for such expectations using a vignette survey experimental setup of 1,150 responses (from 384 respondents). The results indicate that PRP positively affects organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), but that the effect is reduced significantly when PRP is perceived as a control factor, because the importance of intrinsic motivation for effort is weakened. Thus, PRP can cause a cognitive shift from intrinsic to extrinsic orientation, but only if PRP is perceived as controlling. When PRP is perceived as noncontrolling, the importance of intrinsic motivation can actually increase. The findings imply that PRP is not necessarily harmful, and that managers should pay close attention to how their employees perceive performance-based pay systems. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","motivation; motivation crowding theory; organizational citizenship behavior; performance-related pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016720083

We propose that networks with more individual ties provide more diverse knowledge, enable greater autonomy and ease access to resources from contacts, hence facilitating exploration. Analysis of an original dataset of external networks of 77 senior managers in a large global consulting firm provides support for our arguments. We find that individual ties are positively related to exploration and, furthermore, that the positive (negative) relationship between sparse (dense) networks and exploration increases with the number of individual ties in managers’ networks. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","corporate entrepreneurship; exploration; firm performance; network content; network structure; professional service firms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014715894

It demonstrates how the encounter between the city administration and “the open” juxtaposes the decentralizing principles of the crowd, such as transparency, participation, and distributed cognition, with the centralizing principles of bureaucracy, such as secrecy, expert knowledge, written files, and rules. The paper explores how this theoretical conundrum is played out and how senior city managers perceive Open Government in relation to the bureaucratic nature of their administration. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to empirically trace the complexities of the encounter between bureaucracy and Open Government; and second, to critically theorize the ongoing rationalization of public administration in spite of constant challenges to its bureaucratic principles. In so doing, the paper advances our understanding of modern bureaucratic organizations under the condition of increased openness, transparency, and interaction with their environments. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","bureaucracy; democracy; open government; open government data; organization theory; public administration; Vienna",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014635795

Using data from a subsidiary based in Sub-Saharan Africa and headquartered in Europe, we show that subsidiary managers need more time than usually expected to react to headquarters' demands. Subsidiary managers sometimes postpone or test headquarters' demands before deciding how to respond to them. In addition, subsidiary managers can implement headquarters' demands in ways that do not fit the expectations from the headquarters or local actors (e.g., customers and suppliers), thus resulting in additional delays. Headquarters managers must be aware that implementation can take longer than they anticipate, particularly for subsidiaries located in environments that differ substantially from the environment of the headquarters. Managerial summary: In this article, we examine responses to the conflicting institutional demands faced by an e-commerce subsidiary located in Sub-Saharan Africa and headquartered in Europe. Following an inductive approach, we gathered data from a six-month participant-observation study and interviews with local managers. Our findings show that the subsidiary managers responded to conflicting institutional demands in a dynamic way, taking one response after the other. In some cases, the subsidiary managers responded in a way that they thought would be satisfactory, but subsequent pressures from their headquarters or their local environment pushed them to adopt a new response. In other cases, the subsidiary managers intentionally adopted responses knowing they would (have to) adopt another response later in the process. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Yet, anecdotally there is a high failure rate among these poultry farms. This current study seeks to understand the relationship between network ties and survival chances of small commercial poultry farms (SCPFs). We utilize data from a 2-year network survey of SCPFs in rural Ghana. The survival of these poultry farms are modelled using a lagged probit model of farms that persisted from 2014 into 2015. We find that network ties are important to the survival chances of the SCPFs in Ghana. Distribution ties are associated with negative survival chances and this is not even reversed if the human capital of the owner increases although managers with higher human capital and higher distribution ties experience positive effects. Industry ties are associated with positive ties but this probability reduces as the number of industry ties increases but moderation with dynamic capability of the firm reverses this trend. Our findings show that not all network ties aid survival and therefore small commercial poultry farmers need to be circumspect in the network ties they cultivate and develop. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","agricultural firms; Ghana; network ties; poultry; survival",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009789250

However, a rapid decline in their area due to changes in land use and a lack of tree regeneration has recently been observed all over Europe, which has led to the necessity of a deeper understanding of their behaviour in relation to different factors via a detailed analysis of the history of the changes in their distribution over space and time. Despite the recent increase in the number of related studies, information on historic patterns of wood-pastures in many European locations, such as Czechia, remains incomplete. The goal of this study is to assess the habitat continuity of current wood-pastures and to analyse the land-use/land-cover changes of historical and current wood-pastures in lowlands and warm landscapes of hills and basins of Czechia. To achieve this, nine sites covering a total area of 98.6 km2 were studied in Czechia. The situation on three time horizons (1820–1840s, the early 1950s and today) was analysed. The results have shown that almost all wood-pastures from the 1st half of the 19th century have now been lost and most of the currently existing ones were formed from the 1950s till today. Most wood-pastures, which were lost by the 1950s, were turned into open habitats, such as arable lands, and the ones lost from 1950 were turned into forest. New wood-pastures are mostly formed from open habitats, often in former military areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Analysis of historical maps; Change trajectories; Habitat continuity; Land cover change; Land use change; Silvopastoral systems; Wood-pastures","habitat; land cover; land use change; lowland environment; map; pasture; trajectory; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009761240

In order to advance our understanding of smartphone-based mobile shopping acceptance, this study integrates and extends existing approaches from technology acceptance literature by examining two previously underexplored aspects. First, the study examines the impact of different mobile and personal benefits (instant connectivity, contextual value, and hedonic motivation), customer characteristics (habit), and risk facets (financial, performance, and security risk) as antecedents of mobile shopping acceptance. Second, it is assumed that several acceptance drivers differ in relevance subject to the perception of three mobile shopping characteristics (location sensitivity, time criticality, and extent of control), while other drivers are assumed to matter independent of the context. Based on a dataset of 410 smartphone shoppers, empirical results demonstrate that several acceptance predictors are associated with ease of use and usefulness, which in turn affect intentional and behavioral outcomes. Furthermore, the extent to which risks and benefits impact ease of use and usefulness is influenced by the three contextual characteristics. From a managerial perspective, results show which factors to consider in the development of mobile shopping applications and in which different application contexts they matter. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008939346

It remains unclear whether these advantages reflect the effects of relationships in which people discuss only work-related issues, or whether they are attributable to the effects of multiplex relationships, in which people discuss work-related and non-work-related issues. To investigate this question, we conducted two studies using network analysis: a cross-sectional study of specialty bank employees and a longitudinal study of middle managers enrolled in an MBA course. Multiplex relationships consistently predicted performance advantages in both samples, whereas work-focused ties that excluded a social dimension did not. Furthermore, when individuals maintained too many multiplex relationships, performance returns diminished. These findings demonstrate that the network literature may benefit from greater specificity on relational content and more attention to the consequences of overlapping networks, in the form of multiplex ties. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","individual performance; multiplex; network theory; social capital; social networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008702190

The framework consists of three models: the first model describes the operational modes and activity states of a vessel; the second model describes the conceptual dependency between the different actors in the operational context and the last model presents the conceptual solution model, which integrates the two other models. The models are developed based on nearly 50 interviews conducted with seafarers and office staff, procedure descriptions, and observations during fieldwork on board the ships.

However, evolving literature in this field has unfortunately resulted in a multitude of innovation approaches leading to terminology confusion and fragmented literature. Hence, this study is an attempt to systematically organize and synthesize the research on innovation approaches originated in, for or from emerging markets. An extensive systematic review of the existing literature is carried out to investigate the progress of prior research, and to use the insights to define future research pathways. This review is primarily based on the most frequently used innovation approaches, especially frugal innovation, jugaad, disruptive innovation, Gandhian innovation, catalytic innovation, indigenous innovation, bricolage, blowback innovation, trickle-up innovation, resource-constrained innovation, and BOP innovation. Our analysis finds growing standardization in terminology usage and increasing emphasis on 'bottom-up' and structured innovation approaches. De-emphasizing the role of technology transfers and spillovers from the West, the findings exhibit increasing applications of these innovations beyond emerging markets to wider markets. Our research results also shed light on the evolution of the topic and instigate further research explorations in the direction of analyzing the user adoption of these constraint-based innovations and understanding the influence of new technological advancements, such as the Internet, mobile telecommunications, and Web 2.0 on the innovation process, with a special focus on the service industry. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Bottom of the pyramid (BOP); constraint-based innovations; disruptive innovation; emerging markets; frugal innovation; reverse innovation","Commerce; Technology transfer; Terminology; Bottom of the pyramids; Disruptive innovations; Frugal innovations; Future perspectives; Innovation approach; Mobile telecommunications; Systematic literature review; Technological advancement; Innovation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006957560

However the traditional methods used to research the development of network collaboration can be limited in the insights they provide as they often focus on single interviews in a single time perspective and/or are analyzed for content in a single way. This paper illustrates the insights that can emerge from more pluralistic data collection and analysis. Multi-method longitudinal research considers a Danish advertising and communication firm engaging their network in co-creating ideas to help them in their environment of rapid globalization and emergence of new technologies. A five stage research design combines participatory workshops and one-on-one interviews over an eight month period. Comparative lexicographic (i.e. semantic) analysis was used to ascertain participants' perceptions of the development and the processes of changing relationship orientation. It illustrates the processes of change and impact of the workshops with participant reflections becoming ever-more collaboration-oriented and solutions-oriented over the period of research, resulting in bringing more business to the firm.

Foresight is an important part of creating smart specialization strategies. However, both the smart specialization concept and foresight have been criticized for lacking an empirical and theoretical foundation that can help guide their application in practice. This paper contributes to the theoretical foundation of smart specialization and regional foresight by drawing on the field of economic geography and elaborating a typology for patterns of smart specialization. We highlight that there are different paths to reaching smart specialization within the same industrial domain. The empirical research focuses on the offshore wind service sector in four regions around the North Sea. The findings corroborate a typology that offers four distinct patterns—diversification, transition, radical foundation, and modernization—all of which can enable the creation of new industrial activities where regions enter an emerging industry based on fundamentally different starting points. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Foresight; Offshore wind servicing; Regional branching; Regional foresight; Renewable energy; Smart specialization dynamics; Smart specialization policy; Theory","Technological forecasting; Foresight; Offshore winds; Regional branching; Regional foresight; Renewable energies; Theory; Innovation; alternative energy; conceptual framework; economic diversification; innovation; offshore structure; regional policy; technology policy; theoretical study; wind power; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995642082

The reason is their potential to influence socio-technical regimes connected to policy areas in which they have authority. Supported by mandates, moral standing and technical expertise, IGOs act in two ways: operating with high level of political support, these organisations guide priority setting and norm development through the definition of collective problems and solutions, including STI aspects, establishing a shared vision; involving public and private actors, IGOs implement and protect novel practices that reinforce the new norms, from legally binding agreements to the creation of new spaces for international collaboration. These processes are examined here in the field of global health, where outside pressure directed at the intellectual property rules in connection to access to medicines prompted the WHO to define the health challenge as a need to stimulate innovation and ensure wide access to technology at the same time. Two of the solutions implemented by IGOs to achieve both goals are analysed: the Medicines Patent Pool, designed by UNITAID to fulfil access and innovation needs in relation to HIV/AIDS drugs, and WIPO Re:Search, set up by WIPO to support collaboration and accelerate discovery and product development for Neglected Tropical Diseases, Malaria and Tuberculosis. © 2016 The Author(s)","Global health; Grand Challenges; Innovation; Intergovernmental Organisations; Patent pools","Diseases; Health; Innovation; International cooperation; Societies and institutions; Global health; Grand Challenge; Intergovernmental Organisations; International collaborations; Neglected tropical disease; Patent pool; Problems and Solutions; Socio-technical regimes; Patents and inventions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992396662

While branding often relies on simplified messages, the effectiveness of such strategies for complex brands remains questionable. Residents in particular possess a confounded knowledge of the place and could disagree with simplified destination brands. To test the role of brand complexity for residents and tourists, we conducted two empirical studies (N = 765; N = 385), showing that, for residents, positive place attitude (i.e., place satisfaction, identification, and attachment) and place behaviour (i.e., positive word-of-mouth) increase with a higher brand complexity. The second study shows that the positive relationship of brand complexity is stronger for residents than for tourists, supporting the conclusion that brand complexity is relevant for place brands, but that the place brand for residents requires more complexity than a destination brand, while it imperative that both are integrative parts of an overall brand. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Brand complexity; Destination branding; Multiple stakeholders; Place branding; Place identification; Social identity theory","complexity; marketing; stakeholder; tourism management; tourist destination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992170317

The SCMs applied in Melbourne and Copenhagen are similar, but using a new framework for technological stabilization we identify differences in their application due to different physical, organizational and cultural contexts in the two cities, drought being the main driver during the past decade in Melbourne (1997–2010) and pluvial flooding in Copenhagen (2007-). In Melbourne there is currently a strong integrated understanding of SCMs: after decades of “new technology” development, “testing” and “opportunity” seeking a large degree of “agreement” about stormwater management as a mainstreamed professional practice has arisen. In Copenhagen there are currently multiple conflicting understandings of SCMs and signs of an emerging integrated understanding that offers “opportunities” for further development and implementation. It is clear from Melbourne's history that: successful full scale demonstration projects supported and developed by a wide range of actors helps building a common vision for SCM technologies, supportive policies across several governmental levels provide incentives for implementation, and inclusive actions in the closure process provides a sense of ownership for SCM technologies across disciplines. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Cities; Social construction of technology; Sociotechnical systems; Stormwater management; Water management; Water sensitive urban design","Climate change; Engineering geology; Stabilization; Storm sewers; Water management; Cities; Social construction of technology; Sociotechnical systems; Storm-water managements; Water sensitive urban designs; Storms; stormwater; urban design; urban development; urbanization; waste technology; water management; Australia; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84990818457

The parallel algorithm is a variant of the well known PC algorithm. The PC algorithm is a constraint-based algorithm consisting of five steps where the first step is to perform a set of (conditional) independence tests while the remaining four steps relate to identifying the structure of the Bayesian network using the results of the (conditional) independence tests. In this paper, we describe a new approach to parallelization of the (conditional) independence testing as experiments illustrate that this is by far the most time consuming step. The proposed parallel PC algorithm is evaluated on data sets generated at random from five different real-world Bayesian networks. The algorithm is also compared empirically with a process-based approach where each process manages a subset of the data over all the variables on the Bayesian network. The results demonstrate that significant time performance improvements are possible using both approaches. © 2016 The Authors","Bayesian network; Parallelization; PC algorithm","Algorithms; Learning algorithms; Parallel algorithms; Statistical tests; Bayesian network structure; Constraint-based; Independence tests; Large datasets; New approaches; Parallelizations; Process-based approach; Real-world; Bayesian networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979729471

Data on 5827 country pages of 240 multinational firms on Facebook, the most popular SNS today, is used. Creating a foreign country-specific Facebook page is considered the SNS equivalent of opening a physical subsidiary in that country. The data show that multinationals exhibit internationalization behavior described by distance-dependent explanations, rather than the distance-invariant view, despite seemingly lower internationalization costs. Specifically, firms start internationalizing to institutionally closer countries, and gradually expand to more institutionally distant countries. They also tend to internationalize within their home region. The results point to the relevance of distance-dependent explanations of internationalization even in a seemingly low-friction environment of SNS, and the importance of explicitly accounting for internationalization costs in studies of cross-border expansion. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Facebook; Global strategy; Internationalization; Multinational corporations; Regional strategy; Social networking sites",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966670989

Sal, Frederiksberg, 2000, Denmark","This article analyses board structures in listed Danish banks in the years prior to the financial crisis by exploring the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and credit risk exposure. The article presents a novel approach as it relies on a newly developed risk metric entitled the “Supervision Diamond” introduced by the Danish FSA, which “external” board directors must address. It contains five thresholds for measuring a bank’s exposure to credit risks i.e. the proportion of large customers, lending growth, the ratio of lending/deposits, liquidity buffer and the proportion of real estate loans. By employing quantitative governance variables the article finds that increased executive director remuneration is associated with increased credit risk posed by the bank’s borrowers. On the other hand, increasing the number of executive/“inside” directors is associated with a lower credit risk exposure. It is argued that more “inside” directors on the executive board constitutes a stronger “checks and balance” system. The article also documents that the probability of obtaining state capital from the Danish credit bailout package is negatively related to larger boards as well as higher executive director remuneration. The policy implication is that financial authorities should be increasingly aware of insufficient corporate governance characteristics in order to prevent excessive credit risk exposure. Moreover, the article provides important insights on which corporate governance variables have a significant impact on a bank’s credit risk exposure. This knowledge is valuable for financial authorities/policy makers considering future regulatory initiatives and how they should administer bank monitoring. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Board composition; Corporate governance; Credit risk exposure and banking; Financial regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962723016

The present paper sets out to explore the safeguards that nurtured development of a robust, market based financing system and a deep mortgage market. Observations are made on the nature of collateral performance in respect to property rights, mortgage law and market development in search of general features of required institutional arrangements. The robustness of the Danish mortgage finance system is largely accredited to the securitization model based on the balance principle that assigns risks and responsibility to market players in a self-disciplinary manner and protected the mortgage banks against cash flow mismatches even during deep crisis, as history attests. It is shown how property registers and effective enforcement have created transparent property rights and practically reduced legal risks of mortgaging to zero. Standardization and scale of economics supported collateral efficiency, as measured in terms of simplicity, transparency, rapidity and costs. The Danish mortgage finance system illustrates the critical role of government in insuring the quality and enforceability of mortgage collateral, and reducing uncertainty for market players throughout the entire process. The paper suggests that sound incentive structures of the securitization model, strong commitment mechanisms and the market mechanisms constituted a complex formula of safeguards that—rather than specific capital coverage requirements—created the preconditions required for a well-functioning mortgage market. © 2014, The Author(s).","G01; G14; G15; G21; K10; K11; K42; R30",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940291736

With system as the core concept of systems theory, its actual meaning is not just of theoretical interest but is highly relevant also for systems practice. It is argued that complexity theory and thinking with reference to Luhmann a.o. ought to be recognised and paid attention to by the systems community. Overall, it is found that a complexity orientation may contribute to extend and enrich the explanatory power of current systems theory when used to complex real-world problems. As regards systems practice it is found that selective use and combination of five presented research approaches (functionalist, interpretive, emancipatory, postmodern and complexity) which function as different but complementing 'epistemic lenses' in a process described as constructive circularity, may strengthen the exploration and learning efforts in systems-based intervention. © 2017, IGI Global.

This study investigated how different types of street network buffering methods compared in measuring a set of commonly used built environment measures (BEMs) and tested their performance on associations with physical activity outcomes. Methods: An internationally-developed set of objective BEMs using three different spatial buffering techniques were used to evaluate the relative differences in resulting explanatory power on self-reported physical activity outcomes. BEMs were developed in five countries using 'sausage,' 'detailed-trimmed,' and 'detailed,' network buffers at a distance of 1 km around participant household addresses (n = 5883). Results: BEM values were significantly different (p < 0.05) for 96% of sausage versus detailed-trimmed buffer comparisons and 89% of sausage versus detailed network buffer comparisons. Results showed that BEM coefficients in physical activity models did not differ significantly across buffering methods, and in most cases BEM associations with physical activity outcomes had the same level of statistical significance across buffer types. However, BEM coefficients differed in significance for 9% of the sausage versus detailed models, which may warrant further investigation. Conclusions: Results of this study inform the selection of spatial buffering methods to estimate physical activity outcomes using an internationally consistent set of BEMs. Using three different network-based buffering methods, the findings indicate significant variation among BEM values, however associations with physical activity outcomes were similar across each buffering technique. The study advances knowledge by presenting consistently assessed relationships between three different network buffer types and utilitarian travel, sedentary behavior, and leisure-oriented physical activity outcomes. © 2017 The Author(s).","Built environment; GIS methods; Network buffer; Reliability; Self-reported physical activity","comparative study; environmental factor; GIS; neighborhood; physical activity; reliability analysis; travel behavior; Brazil; comparative study; cross-sectional study; demography; Denmark; environmental planning; epidemiology; exercise; geographic information system; health behavior; human; international cooperation; New Zealand; physiology; procedures; traffic and transport; United Kingdom; United States; walking; Brazil; Cross-Sectional Studies; Denmark; Environment Design; Exercise; Geographic Information Systems; Health Behavior; Humans; Internationality; New Zealand; Residence Characteristics; Transportation; United Kingdom; United States; Walking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010739151

Focus on solely the use phase of a building is beginning to be replaced by a life-cycle based performance assessment. This study assesses the environmental impact trade-offs between the heat produced to meet a building's space heating load and insulation produced to reduce its space heating load throughout the whole life-cycle of a building. To obtain a more realistic valuation of this tradeoff, a dynamic heat production model, which accounts for political projections regarding change in Danish energy supply was used in the analysis. This novel approach of generating inventory for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) helped to refine an understanding of optimal insulation levels. The findings of this study discourage the over-insulation of houses connected to the district heating grid, which is potentially promoted at present in Danish regulation. It is further concluded that improvement of the mineral wool insulation production process could allow for greater levels of environmentally beneficial insulation and would also help in reducing the overall environmental burden from insulating buildings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Building insulation; Building sustainability; Climate change; Dynamic assessment; Energy systems; Life cycle assessment","Buildings; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Heating; Insulation; Mineral wool; Space heating; Sustainable development; Wool; Yarn; Building energy performance; Building insulations; Dynamic assessment; Energy systems; Environmental burdens; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Performance assessment; Residential building; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027930372

The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method included the following impact categories: Global Warming Potential (GWP100), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Non-Renewable Energy use (NRE), Potential Fresh Water Ecotoxicity (PFWTox) and Potential Biodiversity Damages (PBD). The results showed that GWP100 (in kg CO2 eq, including contribution from soil carbon change) for producing 1 ton of dry matter (t DM) was highest for ryegrass, grass-clover and maize, and lowest for straw. The carbon footprints of ryegrass, grass-clover and maize were affected by including the contribution from soil organic carbon (SOC) changes. Nitrous oxide emissions and emissions related to the production of agro-chemicals (including N-fertilizer) were other hotspots in the carbon footprint. The EP calculated per t DM was highest for grass-clover, ryegrass and maize, and was lowest for straw. NRE use (MJ eq/t DM) was highest for ryegrass, grass-clover and maize and lowest for straw. Major hotspots were diesel use for field operations and agro-chemicals production. The PBD, expressed as Potentially Disappeared Fraction (PDF) showed the highest adverse impact to biodiversity in maize, followed by straw, whereas the results showed relatively lower impact for ryegrass and grass-clover. The PFWTox (CTUe/t DM), at farm level was highest for straw, followed by maize, whereas the values were significantly lower for grass-clover and ryegrass. These variations in ranking of the different biomasses productions using different impact categories for environmental performance showed that it is important to consider a wider range of impact categories for assessing environmental sustainability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Denmark; Ecotoxicity; Environmental impacts; Life cycle assessment; Soil organic carbon","Bioconversion; Biodiversity; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Crops; Damage detection; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Global warming; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Refining; Soils; Sustainable development; Biorefineries; Denmark; Ecotoxicity; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Soil organic carbon; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027925562

The treatment of milk to extend its shelf life is thus an important step in avoiding losses and optimizing resource use. The drawbacks of the most common treatments for shelf stable milk are the loss of nutritional values and high energy consumption. Ultra-high pressure homogenisation (UHPH) is an emerging technology relying on dynamic pressure up to 400 MPa. The combination of high pressure, temperature, shear, cavitation and impingement can provide commercially sterile milk of higher quality and longer shelf life. A life cycle assessment was performed comparing this emerging technology to the common thermal treatment: indirect ultra-high temperature sterilisation combined with non-aseptic homogenisation. The results show that high-pressure based processing has a lower environmental burden compared to the high-temperature based processing, already at pilot-scale, and this difference is primarily due to the lower electricity consumption. Additionally, upscaling considerations were made using power laws and scenario analysis to simulate future full-scale applications of UHPH. The upscaling shows that a decrease in carbon footprint up to 88% is achievable with improvements in efficiency. UHPH could, therefore, represent a substitute for existing practices considering its technological readiness level and potential synergies when integrated into industrial scale production lines. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Food supply and waste; High-pressure based processing; Sterile milk; Upscaling","Carbon; Carbon footprint; Energy utilization; Food supply; Full-scale applications; High energy consumption; High pressure; Industrial-scale production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Sterile milk; Technological readiness levels; Upscaling; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006826666

Although this has been proven, the contribution of Malaysian companies in CDM projects is low. Therefore, this study has been aimed at investigating the determinants of CDM adoption and its impact on companies' performances. Data were gathered by surveying 91 companies in the energy, agriculture, and forestry sectors in Malaysia implementing CDM projects. The data were analysed using the partial least squares technique.

Firstly, suitable Low Impact Development (LID) stormwater management measures for dense urban areas in developing countries were identified based on critical review of literature. Alternatives have been formulated as varying percentages (degree of adoption) of these suitable measures to manage the stormwater sustainably. Further, a novel decision-making framework is developed which generates the hierarchy for selection of the most sustainable stormwater management alternative. Four main criteria (technical, economic, environmental and social) comprising three quantitative and eight qualitative indicators have been used for evaluating seven alternatives. The regional and local societal priorities are captured through criteria-weightings and are translated into a decision-making methodology. Experts' opinions have been included using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). One of the most widely used Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) method, TOPSIS, is used to rank the alternatives and to identify the most sustainable alternatives. Various scenarios to represent different stakeholders' perspectives have been articulated. Alternative with medium level of cost implication and satisfactory level of performance is chosen by the decision making method in most of the scenarios. The proposed decision making approach can be used for selecting sustainable stormwater management options in densely populated areas of developing countries. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical hierarchy process; Decision-making; Multi-criteria evaluation; Multiple Attribute Decision-Making; Sustainable stormwater management; TOPSIS","Developing countries; Engineering geology; Storm sewers; Storms; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Multi-criteria evaluation; Multiple attribute decision making; Storm-water managements; TOPSIS; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006757652

In terms of conceptual background, this research fits within the context of environmental management in organizations, focusing on the adoption of environmental technologies in the manufacturing context and their critical success factors. In terms of methodology, this research is based on a case study conducted on two medium-sized industrial companies located in Brazil (company “Alfa” and company “Beta”). The results show the emergence of a new CSF called employee empowerment, which derives from learning and benchmarking initiatives. Two CSFs can be highlighted as the most relevant and unanimously present in both company “Alpha” and company “Beta”: support from senior management and employee empowerment through learning and benchmarking. In addition, communication and cultural organizational changes were relevant CSFs, especially for Beta. Furthermore, there is a potential synergistic relationship between CSFs and the maturity level of environmental management. For example, Beta was on a more advanced environmental level as well as had greater intensity in terms of CSFs than Alpha. This work can be considered one of the first researches relating CSFs and the adoption of environmental technologies in medium-sized firms in Brazil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Critical success factors; Environmental technologies; Small and medium enterprises; Sustainability; Sustainable operations","Benchmarking; Environmental management; Industrial research; Manufacture; Sustainable development; Critical success factor; Employee empowerment; Environmental levels; Industrial companies; Manufacturing companies; Organizational change; Small and medium enterprise; Sustainable operations; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006507530

To minimize loss of fish, preventive and curative water treatments are typically applied by adding sodium chloride and/or formalin into the ponds. This note from the field describes a simple alternative method to improve water quality in a Danish flow through fish farm. Instead of periodic formalin baths/flushes in all ponds, peracetic acid (PAA) was continuously added from a mixing tank to the common water inlet during daytime throughout the spring and summer season. The method was tested on a commercial organic flow through trout farm, and included verification of PAA residuals and distribution in the make-up water, within ponds and in the effluent from the fish farm. PAA was found to be evenly distributed to the ponds, achieved and maintained at concentrations around 0.10–0.15 mg PAA/l corresponding to aimed values. PAA degraded within the fish ponds and negligible amounts of PAA were measured in the discharge. The economic and environmental feasibility of the applied low practical methods was demonstrated as white spot disease outbreak was absent throughout the season without using any formalin. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Better management; Discharge; Disinfectants; Organic aquaculture; White spot disease","Aquaculture; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Disinfectants; Effluents; Fish ponds; Formaldehyde; Lakes; Ponds; Water quality; Aquaculture systems; Economic returns; Environmental feasibility; Flow-through fish farms; Organic aquacultures; Peracetic acids; Practical method; White spots; Fish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006470308

Therefore, via an analytical model, we examine the impact of modularity and consumer sensitivity to sustainability on the pricing decisions of two competing firms. Consider an environmentally conscious (green) consumer who will buy one of two available, horizontally differentiated products: a modular product (M) manufactured by Firm M or a standard product (S) manufactured by Firm S. Firm M can take advantage of its modular production technology and product return policy. For such a consumer-driven demand setting, we develop a model and solve to optimality a single-stage, non-cooperative game where both firms simultaneously set their competitive prices. In addition to analytical expressions for the optimal prices and the profits for both firms, we provide structural results and numerical examples to render practical insights: The refund rate has a strong impact on profits; sensitivity of product greenness can be increased by conscientious advertising, and the reusability of modular parts encourages lower pricing and higher market share. We assert that modularity is a strong concept and practice in developing sustainable products and thereby in production, which, in turn, may enhance sustainable consumption. This study's findings have direct implications for reverse supply chain management, and firms should take these findings into account early in the product design phase. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Game theory; Mass customization; Modularity; Supply chain management; Sustainability","Competition; Costs; Game theory; Profitability; Reusability; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Analytical expressions; Consumer-driven demands; Differentiated products; Mass customization; Modularity; Reverse supply chain management; Sustainable consumption; Unsustainable development; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006355599

A company's capability to make sustainability more dynamic and integrated with strategies, transforming it into a business asset, has yet to be studied. This process of adaptation is reflected through innovative practices. However, there is still a gap between these practices and the organization's strategies and capabilities. The aim of this work was to conduct a systematic literature review of the dynamic capabilities for sustainability. Afterward, it was possible to systematize the available knowledge, assessing the current lack of research integrating both themes. The mainstream literature was classified and coded, resulting in a framework for what has been done to date, with recommendations to guide future research. Results show that more research is needed on dynamic capabilities for sustainability, especially in emerging economies in general. Future studies should also consider mixed methodologies and comparative perspectives in multiples sectors or in the services sector. There is also opportunity to discuss managerial innovations toward sustainability through research alliances between different institutions around the world. In short, there are few studies that connect both themes— corporate sustainability and dynamic capabilities—and for this reason there is an opportunity for future studies seeking to identify what kind of dynamic capabilities can be developed to more effectively overcome the emerging sustainability challenges. © 2016","Dynamic capabilities; Dynamic capability; Literature review; Sustainability; Sustainable innovation","Enterprise resource management; Managers; Corporate-sustainability; Dynamic capabilities; Emerging economies; Innovative practices; Literature reviews; Organizational capabilities; Organizational strategy; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84995975044

This study presents an assessment of the environmental performance of an increased circular bioresource management system obtained by reallocating the organic fraction of the household waste from combustion (Reference Scenario) to biogas and fertilizer production (Alternative Scenario). The goals defined in the Danish National resource action plan for waste management, i.e. 33% reduction of organic fraction household waste dry weight, is taken as a case study. A comparative life cycle assessment of the diverting of the organic fraction of the household waste away from a Waste to Energy combustion plant towards sludge- and manure-based biogas plants in North Zealand (Denmark) shows a net increase in renewable electricity production of 39% at the expense of a reduction in heat production of 8%. Moving up the waste hierarchy results in a net greenhouse gas emission reduction of 100 kg CO2eq. per ton of dry weight biowaste treated, corresponding to a 10% of reduction in CO2 emission. The latter accompanied by a net reduction in depletion of fossil resources of 11% and a reduction in the impacts on Freshwater and Marine Eutrophication of 4.8 t P eq. and 3.6 t N eq., respectively. As such, the modelled increased circular bioresource management indicates significant improvement of the efficiency in use of resources in biowaste. However, trade-offs occur due to the presence of micropollutants in the natural fertilizers that results in future increased damage cost on terrestrial ecosystems and human health exists. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biobased production; Biowaste; Industrial ecology; Life cycle assessment; Resource efficiency","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Emission control; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Waste incineration; Waste management; Bio-based; Bio-waste; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resource efficiencies; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992696180

Cleaner technologies advancement and optimal regulation on the transporting behaviors and related design in infrastructures is critical to address above issue. To understand the spatial and temporal emissions pattern within transportation lays the foundation for design on better infrastructures and guidance on low-carbon transportation behaviors. The feasibility of Global Positioning System (GPS) and emerging big data analysis technique enable the in-depth analysis on this topic, while to date, applications had been rather few. With this circumstance, this paper analyzed the taxi's energy consumption and emissions and their spatial-temporal distribution in Shanghai, one of the most famous mega cities in China, applying big data analysis on GPS data of taxies. Spatial and temporal features of energy consumptions and pollutants emissions were further mapped with geographical information system (GIS). Results highlighted that, spatially, the energy consumption and emission presented a distribution of dual-core cyclic structure, in which, two hubs were identified. One was the city center, the other was Hongqiao transport hub, the activities and emission was more concentrated in the west par of Huangpu River. Temporally, the highest activity and emission moment was 9–10AM, the second peak occurred in 7–8PM, which were both the traffic rush period. The lowest activity/emission moment was 3–4AM. Causal mechanism for such distribution was further investigated, so as to improve the driving behaviors. Through the exploration of spatial and temporal emissions distribution of taxis via big dada technique, this paper provided enlightening insights to policy makers for better understanding on the travel patterns and related environmental implications in Shanghai metropolis, so as to support better planning on infrastructures system, demand side management and the promotion on low-carbon life styles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Big data mining; GPS; Shanghai; Spatial-temporal emissions distribution; Taxi travel pattern","Big data; Carbon; Data handling; Data mining; Developing countries; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Global positioning system; Pollution; Taxicabs; Urban transportation; Data analysis techniques; Environmental implications; Low carbon transportations; Shanghai; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal distribution; Spatial-temporal features; Travel patterns; Spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84973582097

These three countries are in different level of developmental stages from emerging economy to matured developed economy. We hereby provide a laboratory idea to investigate the socio-economic metabolism under typical development stages, so that enlightenment on global resource management policy making can be made. This study is based on a long-time series data on the material flow analysis on China, South Korea and Japan, applied with up-to date standardized methodologies of material flow accounting. Material flows, resource productivity data, indicators as well as Environmental Kuznets Curve are presented and compared from 1970 to 2008. Driving forces for the material flow change were further investigated with IPAT approach. Obvious differences of resource efficiency, productivity and consumption patterns were verified. Japan presented the trend of dematerialization and technology effects made significant contribution; China was highlighted with surging resource consumption stage, mainly driven by the economic and population factors, even though the resource efficiency was significantly enhanced in the past three decades. South Korea presented the combined features of China and Japan in different stages. Based on the analytical results, information and insights behind results, like the industrial structure, value chain position in the global supply-demand chain and how they had impacts on the resource efficiency and productivity were discussed in-depth. The research results provide critical insights to future effective and efficient global resource management policy making. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","East Asia; IPAT; Material flow analysis; Resource productivity; Transition","Chains; Decision making; Economics; Efficiency; Enterprise resource management; Environmental management; Natural resources management; Public policy; Resource allocation; Time series analysis; East Asia; IPAT; Material flow analysis; Resource productivity; Transition; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994531661

Studies focusing on larger industrial manufacturing systems are relatively rare. The purpose of this case study was to assess environmental and cost-related performance of an updated complex manufacturing system for glass containers (i.e. jars, glass bottles, etc.) compared to the predecessor manufacturing system. The objective was also to identify the most relevant drivers for the environmental and the cost profile of the system solution in application context by the means of Life Cycle Assessment, as well as Life Cycle Costing (LCC). The results were then to be displayed in an Eco-Care-Matrix (ECM) in order to quantitatively visualize the improvements when comparing the updated manufacturing system to the previous one and they were to be discussed in terms of (i) ecodesign levers, (ii) efficiency of the LCA process and (iii) their relevance for the speed and cost of the decision-making process. The LCA results of the production stage of the optimized components showed that the largest contributors to the potential environmental impact of the manufacturing system are the motors due to their material composition, number and mass. The use stage was subsequently recognized as the dominant life cycle stage with Global Warming Potential (GWP) as the leading indicator, due to the long service life (20 years) and the corresponding energy consumption. The analysis of a produced glass bottle's GWP showed that it was reduced by about 40% through optimizing the production system. The LCC showed that the modernization pays off after about five years of service life and that the decision for making an investment should not only be based on the required capital expenditure (CAPEX). Rather, operation expenditure (OPEX) should also be considered in order to reflect the savings gained from lower operating costs, which compensate relatively quickly any higher initial expenditure or initial investment. In order to apply Life Cycle Assessment on larger-scale industrial systems, smart and pragmatic LCA modeling approaches have to be developed and adopted, balancing accuracy of results against efficiency in achieving them. An adequate ecological-and-economic assessment tool would reduce the time and effort when making decisions in this context. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-Care-Matrix (ECM); Individual section machine (IS machine); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Costing (LCC); Manufacturing system","Bottles; Containers; Costs; Decision making; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Glass; Glass bottles; Global warming; Investments; Manufacture; Operating costs; Service life; Complex manufacturing systems; Eco-Care-Matrix (ECM); Ecological and economic; Global warming potential; Individual sections; Industrial manufacturing; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle costing; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994504635

While energy efficiency improvement is the key influencing factor for this goal, its effectiveness is significantly determined by rebound effect. Energy subsidy as an economic regulation policy would significantly affect rebound effect. To explore how China's fossil subsidies reform would affect rebound effect, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation based on a multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Rebound effects at different technological improvement levels are investigated and the impacts of different subsidies reform scenarios on mitigating rebound effects and on the whole economy is analyzed. The results provide significant policy insights: Firstly, rebound effect does exist in China, larger for electricity than for primary energies. Secondly, by removing fossil energy subsides, the rebound effect would be effectively mitigated, and removing all subsides would reduce the rebound effect most, however, it would bring significant negative impacts on the macro economy. Thirdly, an integrated policy with removal of fossil energy subsidies and increment of clean energy subsidies would be more effective, greatly reducing rebound effect and also bring benefits for both economy and environment. Our findings would be critical for China's low-carbon policy making in the future. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","China; Clean energy subsidies; Computable general equilibrium model; Fossil subsidy reform; Rebound effect","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; China; Clean energy; Computable general equilibrium model; Fossil subsidy reform; Rebound effect; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994491668

There is a growing importance on recovery of used materials and products amongst industry players. The Malaysian government has conducted many green campaigns and provided incentives for some green practices; however, the adoption of product return and recovery management is still low amongst automotive manufacturers. Therefore, it is important to understand the obstacles towards product return adoption so that the countermeasures can be thought of to overcome this situation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the barriers of product return management amongst automotive manufacturing firms in Malaysia. A total of 228 automotive manufacturers and assemblers were identified as the sampling frame, which was selected based on the census sampling method due to the limited sample size of the study. The data was analysed using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) with the measurement model had shown sufficient model fit and the structural model revealed that the data supported the hypothesised model. The large effect size and higher than zero values of the predictive capabilities imply that the model has sufficient variance explained for the predictive capability of the hypotheses testing of the study. Based on the results, this study has found that the resource barrier has a significant effect on the level of adoption of product returns. Specifically, the resource barrier and the extent of the manufacturing return adoption were positively related (β = 0.361, p < 0.01), resource barrier and the extent of the distribution returns (β = 0.252, p < 0.05), and resource barrier and the extent of the customer returns (β = 0.333, p < 0.01). The result reflects that automotive manufacturers have a lack of resources to afford the product return implementation; as a matter of fact, high initial investments in terms of finances, human resources, and time are required for the product return adoption. Other variables of the study, such as the attitudinal and perception barrier, information barrier, and technical barrier, were found to be insignificant with the adoption of product return management. As a conclusion, this study discovered that the resource barrier was the major obstacle that impeded the automotive manufacturers in Malaysia from adopting the product return management. The outcome is expected to help policy makers, manufacturers as well as stakeholders in setting appropriate policies and strategies to improve the product return and recovery management adoption. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudinal and perception barriers; Information barrier; Product returns; Resource barrier; Technical barrier","Global warming; Least squares approximations; Recovery; Information barrier; Perception barriers; Product returns; Resource barrier; Technical barriers; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994285359

The study shows that historically embedded images of places are hardto manage and change when they involve elements with negative appeal towards a specific target audiencee.g. entrepreneurs. The branding problem for the municipality is shown to be the conflict betweenthe brands of history, entrepreneurial spirit, family friendly town, and tourism etc. To manage a placebrand so diverse is almost impossible and it is clearly demonstrated that the solution has been to brandthe place as everything for everybody. © 2017, IGI Global.

In the late 1960s, Malaysia became the world’s largest palm oil exporter. Based on archival material from British colonial institutions and agency houses, this paper focuses on the governance dynamics that drove institutional change within this cluster during decolonization. The analysis presents three main findings: (i) cluster boundaries are defined by continuous tug-of-war style negotiations between public and private actors; (ii) this interaction produces institutional change within the cluster, in the form of cumulative ‘institutional rounds’–the correction or disruption of existing institutions or the creation of new ones; and (iii) this process leads to a broader inclusion of local actors in the original cluster configuration. The paper challenges the prevalent argument in the literature that minimal, indirect government influence is preferable for cluster development and explores the impact of different political regimes on cluster evolution. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agency houses; Cluster governance; decolonization; institutional change; Malay(si)a; palm oil; rubber",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017563383

The empirical field in which the investigation was set is facility services, a type of business-to-business support services. The findings were extracted from a longitudinal, in-depth case study of a Danish, multi-national organisation over 13 years, complemented with an explorative study in the Danish facility service context. The findings suggest that tensions and conflicts between heterogeneous interest groups are an intrinsic element of innovation processes in services, and that emphasising them might actually support a clearer understanding of processes of innovation in services.

The aim of the paper is to assess which strategic behaviour the PNP sports hall pursued under different types of public management steering models and whether changes in behaviour influenced utilization. The implementation of an activity-based steering model is compared with a non-activity-based steering model. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data, implementing the activity-based steering model resulted in strategic behaviour with a higher utilization, but also the size of the PNP sports hall played an important role for those deciding which strategic behaviour to pursue. To a greater extent than the small ones, the large PNP sports halls had a focus on attracting new users in order to increase utilization as well as income. Furthermore, the small PNP sports halls focus on Voluntary Sport Organizations (VSOs) as their primary user group. Based on the results, it is suggested to change the composition of the board for the PNP sports hall so that the PNP sports halls can escape its current partial deadlock as the VSOs seem to play a dominant role on both the boards and in the sports hall in general. © 2017 World Leisure Organization.","implementation; leisure management; Non-profit organisations; public management; sports facilities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009959400

Here we summarize these opportunities, which include more research on outbound OI, the role of open innovation in services, and network forms of collaboration such as consortia, communities, ecosystems, and platforms. Research should also examine the use of OI by small, new, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as the linkage of individual actions and motivations to open innovation. Other opportunities include better measuring the costs, benefits, antecedents, mediators and moderators of the effects of OI on performance, and understanding why and how OI is rejected, abandoned, or fails.

Six local food networks and their collaboration with local tourism actors are studied by using observation supplemented with other qualitative methods. Analysis of these networks reveals that successful collaboration is characterised by the food networks and tourism actors having at least one logic in common. The fitting logics that lead to success are primarily celebrity and civic logics, which emphasises the community aspect (i.e. that both parties want to support the local community and brand it).

Since then this interest has been continuously growing. This can, to some extent be explained by the increased attention that has been given to entrepreneurship in general, but especially by the increasing focus on entrepreneurial education (EE). In the following, we are revisiting the chapter “Self-Efficacy – Conditioning the Entrepreneurial Mindset” and continue the discussion that the original chapter ended with, namely how we can foster ESE through EE. In particular, we zoom in on how we can assist the formation of an entrepreneurial mindset at the university level (unfolding the young adulthood level to a greater extent). We thereby focus on those individuals who have not yet developed significant levels of ESE in their formative years. We assume that specifically for those individuals EE plays an important role in developing entrepreneurial attitudes, abilities and skills, and hence in enhancing ESE (Neck and Greene 2011). In other areas, researchers are already starting to connect self-efficacy with empowerment, and we explore the potential connections between empowerment and ESE. Concrete examples of how educational interventions can be designed to empower students and increase their ESE will be provided, but we also discuss the issues connected with the increased focus on ESE when designing teaching formats. We will, however, begin by discussing why measuring ESE has become so prevalent as well as presenting and evaluating how the field has developed during the past years to relate to the original chapter’s discussion about the development of ESE scales and how these have been applied. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133806679

According to stakeholder theorists, a state should take into account the interests of all of its citizens, whereas a company should focus on the interests of its stakeholders. I focus on a challenge presented by one of the most famous and influential ethical theories, namely consequentialism. According to consequentialism, there is, at least in principle, no such thing as a division of labour between private enterprises and the state since every moral agent (including individuals, states, and corporations) should try to promote the good, seen from an impartial perspective, meaning that everybody’s interest should be taken into account (Kagan 1989). I conclude that stakeholder theorists are unable to meet the challenge presented by consequentialism by traditional means, i.e. by referring to social proximity principles. However, they might be able to defend their position by basing stakeholder theory on a particular kind of consequentialism. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Corporate Social Performance; Corporate Social Responsibility; Fellow Citizen; Special Responsibility; Stakeholder Theorist",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130907730

Since it arose in the interface between the medical sciences and economics, the way of dealing with problems were often influenced by traditions which were well-established in the medical profession, while the classical way of thinking of economists came was filtering through at a slower pace. This means that much of both teaching and research in health economics puts the emphasis on collecting and analysing data on health and healthcare as well as on public and private outlays on healthcare. This is an extreme useful and worthwhile activity, and much new and valuable information is produced in this way, but occasionally there is a need for in-depth understanding of what is going on, rather than an estimated equation which comes from nowhere. This is where economic theory can offer some support. The present book is an introduction to health economics where the emphasis is on theory, with the aim of providing explanation of phenomena as far as possible given the current level of economics. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Through this multiple-case study, significant differences in ramp-up challenges are identified and related to product volume, product variety, and company type.

There are countless examples of social entrepreneurs that can be cited from around the world. Social entrepreneurs’ personality, temperament and characteristics have been studied by a great number of researchers. The focus has generally been “who social entrepreneur is”. However, few researches have stressed “what social entrepreneur does”, what are his actions and the effects of his actions. This is what the present paper tries to address and explore. The use of qualitative case study approach offers rich social entrepreneurial discovery data. However, due to the scant number of interviews, the present analysis can be considered an exploratory study. Future researches can gather data on a large scale, using variegate samples, to generalise results to a large population.

Related challenges are often named to increase time to market, reduce the effectiveness in product development, and lower process efficiency. For manufacturers with global supply chains, additional uncertainties arise in defining the right manufacturing strategy with respect to production location and postponement. To better understand related managerial implications, this chapter discusses a case study of a global manufacturer providing customized industrial applications. In particular, the study investigates the relationships between product variant profitability and manufacturing strategy relative to postponement and location. The results indicate that an improved configuration of these factors through substitution and supply chain redesign significantly increases the overall product portfolio profitability. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Postponement; Product customization; Substitution; Supply chain complexity; Variant profitability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114029662

Furthermore, we argue that having a Dionysian perspective when using organizational experiments makes it possible to envision and execute experiments inspired by high ambitions and visions to test new ways of organizing in an explorative manner. New meanings are accepted thanks to sensegiving and to the willingness to forget prior experiences and regard them as examples of hypotheses that can be challenged and replaced with new ones as the organization gets new experiences from playful learning. © The authors, 2017.","Apollonian experiment; Change; Dionysian experiment; Meaning; Organizational experiment; Types of experiments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104439737

EU-28 countries have started a new wave of labor market reforms in the aftermath of the 2008/2009 crisis to tackle a number of issues, including labor market segmentation. This particularly concerns reforms in: (1) employment protection, i.e. dismissal protection and restrictions on fixed-term contracts; (2) unemployment benefit generosity and coverage; and (3) the intensity of active labor market policies. The paper provides an overview of reform patterns and tries to assess whether and to what extent these reforms have led to less dualized, more ‘flexicure’ labor markets in terms of dismissal protection, the provision of unemployment benefits and access to ALMPs. In particular, we will provide some evidence on potential changes in hirings on temporary contracts. © The Author(s) 2017.","Employment protection; Flexicurity; Labor market reforms; Unemployment insurance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093681813

Previous research suggests that in order to become a successful mass customizer, companies must hold three fundamental capabilities: solution space development, choice navigation, and robust process design. Since mass customization often requires complex systems related to these three capabilities, this is often resource consuming and can thus be challenging for SMEs due to the smaller scale compared to traditional mass customizers. This paper analyzes six cases of SME mass customizers, by describing and comparing the challenges they have been faced with implementing mass customization. This paper focuses specifically on the capability choice navigation and thus addresses the expected benefits and challenges these companies have encountered in relation to product selectors, product configurators, or other systems used for matching customer requirements with selection within the company’s product variety. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Choice navigation; Mass customization; Multiple case study",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089913692

Most companies utilize the good motives of CSR for corporate branding, to obtain legitimacy and to form their identity according to be ‘a good corporation’ in the eyes of its stakeholders. However, these ethnographic studies show how corporations are not always aligned with the intentions of CSR, because their motives are typically steered by making profits as a primer, in which CSR becomes a means to this end, which is not the purpose of CSR eventually. Ethnographic research methods are splendid for in-depth studies of one or a few organizations for explorative and discursive studies of CSR suggesting new theory development. However, it would be an interesting approach to engage ethnographic studies with quantitative approaches in order to come further up the ladder of actually imposing that the findings from case studies can be found in more than one company/business sector (the studied one) – maybe even be statistically significant. Such mixed method studies can suggest new theory grounded on in-depth findings of a few examples, and if these findings should be verified or generalizable, it needs a quantitative (statistical, significant) doubling. © David Crowther and Linne Marie Lauesen 2017.

The chapter will demonstrate the importance of the concept of responsibility as the foundation of ethics in particular in the fields of politics and economics in the modern civilization marked by globalization and technological progress. I consider that the concept of responsibility in the future will be the key notion in order to understand the ethical duty in a modern technological civilization. We can indeed observe a moralization of the concept of responsibility going beyond a strict legal definition in terms of imputability. Moreover, this implies that corporate responsibility cannot solely be defined strategically in terms of profits or shared values. The chapter begins by discussing the humanistic foundations of such a concept of responsibility. It looks at the historical origins of responsibility and it relates this concept to the concept of accountability. On the basis of this historical determination of the concept I would like to present the definition of the concept of responsibility as a fundamental ethical principle that has increasing importance as the foundation of the principles of governance in modern welfare states. In this context the chapter discusses the extension of the concept of responsibility towards institutional or corporate ethical responsibility where responsibility does not only concern the responsibility of individuals but also deals with the responsibility of institutional collectivities. © David Crowther and Linne Marie Lauesen 2017.

It introduces a brief review of the literature on lifestyle entrepreneurship, building taxonomy of lifestyle entrepreneurs. From a traditional economic perspective, the key aspiration for entrepreneurs is to generate employment and profit for themselves. Wagner and Ziltener claim that lifestyle entrepreneurs “build and manage their business in a manner that reflects their particular personality traits, human capital resources and prior experience gained within a particular local environment”. Shaw and Williams identify the tourism and hospitality sector as one area in which lifestyle entrepreneurs abound in the form of BandBs, one- or two-star inns, guest houses, local restaurants offering locally produced food, farm shops and arts and crafts shops. The millionairess method requires courage. Although the millionairess method has no sexual undertones, the Goddess School, which is linked through the website, is full of them. © 2017 selection and editorial matter, Colette Henry, Teresa Nelson and Kate Lewis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082182571

Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that prototyping can be considered as a punctuation device, as it offers those involved the option of opting out of ongoing processes, routines and engage in playful behavior by allowing for a freer experimentation with materials, processes, methods to challenge existing knowledge and explore potential solutions.

It discusses the promise for revitalizing local democracy through Information and Communication Technology in various concepts of democracy. The potential of the Internet to become a tool in enhancing citizen and democratic influence on municipal regulations and services was still in its very beginning. The Internet created new opportunities for the local governments. By the end of the 1990s almost all Danish municipalities had developed home pages with information for citizens and an Intranet for internal use. Several hypotheses and visions have been put forward on the potential changes of democracy at the global, national, and local level induced by the use of the Internet. The conceptual models of e-Democracy indicate a broad, pluralist concept of democracy and give examples of e-tools. The chapter concludes by reflecting upon the functions of evaluative information in the context of Internet and local governments. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis.

Many concepts and models of evaluation, how to undertake it, and how to make it more useful, were developed before government performance became of so much interest to the public. In fact, it is arguable that recent changes in the forms, shapes, structures, and media through which the information developed in the process of evaluation becomes public, require new ways of thinking about its role in society. What is the role of evaluative information in the public arena today? How, when, and under what circumstances does the actual use of evaluative information take place, and what are the forces at play? By compiling and comparing international case studies, this book considers forces that make the information produced in evaluations increasing ““open to the public.”“ They provide insights into the many factors that influence evaluation and its use in the public arena. Their case studies include such current topics as: ““spin doctoring”“ of information by the media and this practice's relationship to evaluation studies, the hotly debated issue of school performance, and information about it aired in the public arena, and the controversial link between budget processing and government performance. This book will be invaluable to those conducting evaluations, public employees and commissioners, and those studying public administration. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis.

However, social media provide also a perfect platform for negative communication and anti-brand communities which are forming around common aversions toward a specific brand (Hollenbeck and Zinkhan 2006). Emerging research suggests negative consequences of anti-brand communities opposing a sport team, both for the team itself and for its sponsors (Hickman and Lawrence 2010). While most anti-brand communities in sport build around a disliked team, some oppose a sponsor or investor of the team. Research on image transfers (Meenaghan 2001) and balance theory (Dalakas and Levin 2005) provides a suitable theoretical framework for a rationale of interrelationships between the anti-brand community and the team. Given the lack of research on anti-sponsor-brand activism, our research aims to identify the nature and the consequences of anti-sponsor-brand communities for both the sponsor and the team brand. We conducted netnographic research on three Facebook-based anti-brand communities opposing sponsorships of teams from the professional German football league (Bundesliga). One community originates from the rejection of Wiesenhof as jersey sponsor of Werder Bremen. The other two oppose Red Bull as main sponsor of RB Leipzig and the club RB Leipzig. In addition, we studied a related non-Facebook-based anti-RB online community. Netnography on the anti-Red Bull communities discloses that most users join the community to fight against Red Bull which is considered as incarnation of the ultimate commercialization of football. Members disparage the sponsors, the club, and its fans by posting paroles or provoking graphics. Moreover, fans of opponent teams call for boycotts of RB Leipzig games or organize actions at RB Leipzig games. Activists further urge the football association to fight against the commercialization and Red Bull’s activities which undercut league rules. Finally, fans of RB Leipzig visit the anti-RB Leipzig communities and try to defend their team, thereby contributing to the interaction as well as rivalry among fan groups. The example of Werder/Wiesenhof reveals parallels to RB Leipzig but also illustrates strong differences. Half of the members are fans of the sponsee Werder Bremen who try to protect their club against negative spillover effects. The other half mainly consists of activists against industrial livestock farming who engage for animal rights and try to harm the sponsor. Werder fans indicate that their relationship to the club is negatively affected and that they are willing to boycott merchandising articles incorporating the sponsor brand. Finally, we identified a dilemma for sponsees and opposed sponsors: While public media appreciated reactions from the sponsor and the club such as discussion sessions with fans and visits of players at Wiesenhof, they had the opposite effect on the anti-sponsor community and rather stimulated the negative debate. Because of anti-sponsor communities’ multifaceted effects on sponsors as well as clubs, this phenomenon has to be considered and monitored by both of them. The strong dynamics of social networks and propagation of anti-sponsor communities by other media to a broad mass of individuals corroborate this finding. While anti-sponsor community members generally dislike the sponsor, they differ in their attachment to the sponsored team. This imbalance of fan attachment to team and sponsor can lead to negative changes in fans’ attitudes toward the team. Brand managers and teams facing anti-sponsor communities need to identify the (varying) motivations of members in order to find suitable strategies for coping with this anti-sponsor activism.

It is a logical next step in the evolution of the environmental policy agenda, which has shifted from neighbour regulation and end-of-pipe solutions towards process, products, functions and, more recently, systems of consumption and production. With the SCP agenda developing very much internationally, global development issues (rather than a narrow Western European approach) are in focus, and the very different conditions in developed, transition and developing countries must be considered.

Sustainable consumption focuses on formulating equitable strategies that foster the highest quality of life, the efficient use of natural resources, and the effective satisfaction of human needs while simultaneously promoting equitable social development, economic competitiveness, and technological innovation. But this is a complex topic and, as the challenges of sustainability grow larger, there is a need to re-imagine how SCP policies can be formulated, governed and implemented. The EU-funded project “Sustainable Consumption Research Exchanges” (SCORE!) consists of around 200 experts in the field of sustainable innovation and sustainable consumption. The SCORE! philosophy is that innovation in SCP policy can be achieved only if experts that understand business development, (sustainable) solution design, consumer behaviour and system innovation policy work together in shaping it. Sustainable technology design can be effective only if business can profitably make the products and consumers are attracted to them. To understand how this might effectively happen, the expertise of systems thinkers must be added to the mix. System Innovation for Sustainability 1 is the first result of a unique positive confrontation between experts from all four communities. It examines what SCP is and what it could be, provides a state-of-the-art review on the governance of change in SCP policy and looks at the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The SCORE! experts are working with actors in industry, consumer groups and eco-labelling organisations in the key consumption areas of mobility, food and agriculture, and energy use and housing - responsible for 70% of the life-cycle environmental impacts of Western societies - with the aim of stimulating, fostering or forcing change to SCP theory in practice. The System Innovation for Sustainability series will continue with three further volumes of comprehensive case studies in each of these three critical consumption areas. Each chapter of this book examines problems and suggests solutions from a business, design, consumer and system innovation perspective. It primarily examines the differing solutions necessary in the consumer economies of the West, but also comments on the differing needs in rapidly emerging economies such as China, as well as base-of-the-pyramid economies. The System Innovation for Sustainability series is the fruit of the only major international research network on SCP and will set the standard in this field for some years to come. It will be required reading for all involved in the policy debate on sustainable production and consumption from government, business, academia and NGOs for designers, scientists, businesses and system innovators. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076078333

Governments and people in rich countries are just as committed to growth as people in low-income countries, perhaps even more. For a consumer there is no such thing as enough consumption. This makes sustainable consumption almost an oxymoron because how can we achieve lower environmental impact if we are consuming more? ‘Green’ products help to reduce environmental impacts. To achieve even greater reductions together with other sustainability benefits, more is needed than product changes: we need system innovations: that is, transformations and changes in systems of provision and behaviour (Rotmans et al. 2000; Kemp and Rotmans 2004; Smith et al 2005; Weaver et al. 2000). © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076078038

It evaluates the energy-saving benefits that are expected to result from the increased uptake of energy-efficient circulation pumps. The chapter discusses some of the wider implications of the case study, in particular the critical relationship between innovation and public policy in developing and implementing sustainable solutions to climate change. Even though public policy can support business innovations, numerous challenges can be encountered. From this case study, three issues were of particular importance: policy uncertainty, policy weaknesses or gaps in policy and how to use policy to support innovation. The innovation process behind Alpha Pro is therefore a story of how Grundfos engaged with industry peers and policy-makers to overcome this market barrier by creating regulation to support energy-efficient circulation pumps. © 2008 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076076068

They aspire to live with integrity, where their thoughts, values, words and deeds are in harmony. The problem is that they don’t know how to do so in a business world that is increasingly characterised by complexity, turbulence and greed. Leading with Wisdom provides food for thought for people dealing with these challenges. It contains stories and reflections of 31 inspiring and compassionate business leaders who care about what is truly important in life and who integrate this awareness and sensitivity into their leadership. Leaders who search for meaning, purpose and fulfilment both in the external world of business and in the internal world of consciousness and conscience. Leaders whose leadership is a natural expression of their hearts, minds and souls. In other words, leaders who lead from a spiritual basis. Such perspectives on leadership are not yet mainstream. Greed, prestige and power appear to still be prime motivating forces for leaders of the world’s larger corporations. In spite of 25 years of globalisation, poverty is still devastatingly ubiquitous in many parts of the world. In striking contrast, the compensation packages of top leaders in business, particularly in the West, have skyrocketed, reaching levels that would have been considered impossible only a decade ago. What is clearly needed is a change in the mind-set, values and principles of our leaders, as well as of those who finance our enterprises, and of those who teach and mentor our future leaders. At the very minimum, what is needed is an expansion of the concept of ‘success’ so that it transcends the prevailing myopic focus on short-term financial gains. It can be argued that this rampant greed is gradually being tamed, not just by laws, but also by social and ethical norms. In the last two decades there has been an amazing and uplifting focus on such perspectives as business ethics, corporate social responsibility and sustainability. But when leaders are questioned as to why they and their organisations should promote this new and expanded sensitivity to corporate responsibility, their ‘default’ answer typically is that it is profitable - an efficacious means to promote classical business ends of increasing earnings and share prices. But how and why should such an expanded concept of leadership develop? What should provide the motivation for our leaders to find their way in an increasingly complex business world by using a compass that points not only to a pot of gold, but also to a path to deeper meaning and purpose in business? This book does not provide answers in the form of proposals as to new rules or laws or moral injunctions. Rather it provides a collage of perspectives in the form of stories of highly respected and successful executives who have integrated their spiritual search into their leadership so as to be “whole” people - leaders whose thoughts, words and deeds are in harmony with their most fundamental truths and longings, both at work and in their private lives. These stories tell of an emerging culture where business becomes a primary domain for both individual and organisational spiritual growth. Leading with Wisdom: Spiritual-Based Leadership in Business portrays an emerging global culture. This ground-breaking book offers the experiences and perspectives of 31 top executives from 15 countries in 6 continents. It is based on extensive personal interviews. These are business people who express from first-hand experience what it is like to lead a business from a spiritual basis. They tell amazing, down-to-earth, real-life stories about how spirituality and rationality can go hand in hand in leadership and life. Their words of wisdom demonstrate that executives who lead from a spiritual basis can achieve success, recognition, peace of mind and happiness, while at the same time serving the needs of all those affected by their leadership. Written in an engaging style, where the special “voice” of each leader is heard, this book will be profoundly valuable to business leaders at every level and for all people who want to lead with integrity from a spiritual basis. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076069987

After discussing the WTO agreements, the authors also consider the key issue of including demands relating to the manufacturing process in tendering procedures. One of the strongest potentials of greener purchasing is the possibility to pull the development and innovation of cleaner products and technologies through the supply and demand mechanism of the market.

Interviews were conducted in Arusha and Morogoro in Tanzania with managers, owners and beneficiaries of the practices. By using thematic qualitative case studies of the interviews, the study reveals that trust, regular supply of the products and relationship are very important for the CSR supply chain establishment. Furthermore, the study shows that reduced credit facility and rudimentary technology are major challenges that threaten the practices of linking small scale farmers to modern food distribution in Africa.

The serious ecological and social challenges we face in trying to establish global sustainable supply chains must not be underestimated, yet so far research has largely ignored the social dimension in favour of the environmental and economic.

Design/methodology/approach – Two online surveys were conducted with firms associated with the networks during the Autumn and Winter of 2013/2014 (n = 116). The questionnaire was theoretically anchored in the existing sponsorship literature, business network research, and social capital theory. Findings – The results show that business logics were the dominating reasons for joining the network. A large proportion of the respondents reported having increased their number of business (32 percent) and social (26 percent) relations with other network members after joining the network. Furthermore, 37 percent of the respondents reported having made business agreements with companies external to the network via network contacts, which supports ideas of bridging social capital. More than half the respondents (59 percent) preferred doing business with network members rather than with non-members. Originality/value – By investigating a local and regional sport club context, the paper adds to our knowledge about sponsorship networks. It emphasizes the potential importance of team sport clubs for the business landscape, thus maintaining that sport clubs fulfill an important role for local communities beyond being mere entertainment industries. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business-to-business; Network theory; Small businesses; Survey; Team sports club management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062040359

They exist in both informal and formal forms. This chapter pays special attention to VCs in industrial and professional environments, where enterprise processes are carried out through informal as well as formal VCs. In formal organizations, VCs are regarded as dynamic; people or work processes move back and forth between formal business processes and VCs. It is interesting to see how VCs in enterprise landscapes can execute using a common understanding, a single language or an expression, a lingua franca to transform ideas into knowledge, sustain representation of knowledge, and exchange knowledge with the formal, non-virtual organization. Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) has become commonplace for describing and formalizing regular enterprise processes. Additionally, BPMN seems useful, although paradoxical, for VCs. This chapter demonstrates how BPMN interacts with the social constructs and dynamics of VCs. BPMN is used to underpin the VCs' internal ability to execute and fixate the knowledge of the VC, and the knowledge exchange between the VC and the enterprise. The chapter also demonstrates how VCs can be applied to develop BPMNs of the enterprise's knowledge processes, allowing the VCs to strengthen value, but also with the risk of an obsolete VC. Conclusively, BPMN can fuel the VC dynamics and, when used smartly, both retain the VCs' independent value and the value of the VCs to the enterprises relying on them. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

First, we employ a multidimensional measure of welfare that is well suited for the analysis of publicly provided services. Government expenditure has for many years been an important area of emphasis in Tanzania with much of this expenditure targeted at key public services in areas such as health, education, water, and sanitation. We use a series of four Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) undertaken between 1992 and 2010 to consider the effectiveness of these investments using a relatively novel first order dominance (FOD) approach to non-monetary poverty measurement. Second, we employ a detailed economy-wide model of the Tanzanian economy to explore growth and poverty reduction scenarios from 2007 to 2015 with a focus on monetary poverty outcomes. The model attempts to track the basic observed facts between the 2007 and 2012 household budget surveys,1 including an estimated six percentage point decline in the national monetary consumption poverty rate, and then projects an additional three years.

In many parts of the world, and especially in developing countries, basic public services like education, health, basic infrastructures, as well as water and sanitation, are often poor and patchy even when available. Such services are reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Agenda for 2030, and also address challenges like poverty, food, housing and employment. All of these need innovative public service delivery if targets are to be achieved by 2030. However, the provision of such services is increasingly challenged by the diversity of social needs across different locations and population segments. Mainstream, largely off-the-shelf, ICT has tremendous potential today and in the near future to innovatively address these needs and challenges, and there are already many valuable experiences both from developed and developing countries about how this can make huge differences to public service delivery. The chapter also addresses the governance and policy issues that need to be addressed in this context. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060195557

The MSP was comprised of a wide range of members, e.g., representatives of national authorities of EU member-states and European Free Trade Association countries; the European and international ICT standardization bodies and stakeholder organizations representing industry; small- and medium-sized enterprises, consumers, and other stakeholders. The MSP was set up by the European Commission as a new kind of collaborative forum in ICT standardization, partly in response to the otherwise consolidated and formalized European standardization system, which had a clear allocation of competences between exclusively selected public and private actors, yet also inefficiencies due to a rather bureaucratic governance system. This chapter outlines the creation of the MSP as a new ICT-enabled collaborative decision-making system in European ICT standardization. Not due to the application of new technologies, but due to the systemic consequences of the fast development of ICT for political, administrative and regulatory setups of collaboration in Europe. This chapter provides an analysis of the MSP as a new type of forum for deliberation and cooperation in European ICT standardization, and it outlines how the platform facilitates a regulatory dialogue on ICT standardization in Europe. Simultaneously, the MSP plays a significant role in public–private co-creation of regulation and ICT standardization, and it may prove to be a pathbreaker leading to a ‘paradigm shift’ in the governance of European standardization. Finally, certain implications of the MSP are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","European union; Formal recognition; Private actor; Private standard; Public procurement",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060182062

A firm’s CSR behavior influences positively corporate evaluations, purchase intention, and willingness to pay (e.g., Biehal and Sheinin 2007). However, certain contingencies have an important influence on the degree to which a CSR campaign achieves the intended consumer response. Among the most impactful such contingencies are consumer attributions, i.e., the motives that consumers attribute to corporate CSR behavior. Attributions are complex (Brown et al. 2006), and with strong predicting power on consumer outcomes (Skarmeas and Leonidou 2013). This paper aims at testing the mediating role of consumer attributions on the relationship between specific CSR characteristics and consumer responses. The study involves an experiment in the context of environmental sustainability that investigates: (a) if CSR Timing (i.e., proactive vs. reactive launch) and CSR Intensity (i.e., high vs. low time and financial commitment) have an effect on consumers’ corporate attitude and purchase intention; and (b) if consumer attributions (i.e., egoistic, strategic, value-driven, and stakeholder-driven) about the company’s CSR campaign mediate the way Timing and Intensity impact on consumer attitude and purchase intention. Findings add to past research and the ongoing discussion about the nature of attributions (i.e., Vlachos et al. 2009; Walker et al. 2010). Specifically, findings support that proactive and high intensity CSR is likely to offset a series of negative consumer responses and their antecedents, like skepticism or mistrust (Park et al. 2014), activating more virtu-driven attributions. On the other hand, reactive and low-intensity CSR might raise perceptions of corporate social irresponsibility (i.e., Lin-Hi and Muller 2013), leveraging more self-relevant attributions. Results also show that the past-research conclusion of consumers having a dual attributions’ system (Ellen et al. 2006) is ambivalent. Interestingly, the two CSR conditions of this study lead to attributions of different dimensionality (i.e., dual, company intrinsic–extrinsic in the Timing condition; and unidimensional, company-extrinsic, in the Intensity condition). This verifies that it is harder to stimulate dual-configuration attributional types in the presence of specific CSR characteristics, e.g., proactive Timing activates less egoistic attributions, but Intensity does not. The above conclusions have important practical implications. The fact that specific CSR elements (i.e., CSR Timing) activate dual-level CSR motives that act synergetically indicates that managers should be clear about the possibilities of various elements of their CSR initiatives and how much impact they expect those elements having on consumer response. Dual-level CSR attributions can offset negative perceptions of CSR behavior better, by inhibiting the impact of its antecedents more than unidimensional CSR attributions. On the other hand, managers must be cautious in developing and implementing CSR programs with obvious egoistic objectives or high risk of consumers perceiving them as such (for instance, as an immediate reaction to a negative incident). © 2017, Academy of Marketing Science.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055486372

As part of my PhD I am carrying out in-depth case studies in a non-business medium-cycle higher educational context following a qualitative ethnographic-inspired methodology. I consider the context as 'non-business' in the sense that the research is carried out at an institution that educates professionals to become employed in the Danish public welfare sector. Expectations to the student's knowledge and skills transform as a need for newness and a need to fulfill new collaborative spaces in and between public, private and civil sectors grow. Thus, new courses have been developed driven by the notions of innovation and entrepreneurship. My research is empirical and follows 'how' and 'why' oriented research questions to explore how students working in teams create innovative initiatives and why their projects are created and led in certain directions. In the paper, I move from the research frame of the PhD project to outline that three overall, emerging, preliminary themes concerning 1) a team-environment nexus, 2) dialectics and 3) pragmatics can explain enablers and barriers for innovation and entrepreneurship. From these themes, I argue that to understand innovation and entrepreneurship we need to think of the students' team practice in relation to endeavors across a learning-creation spectrum and a contextual spectrum. The data is gathered from a faculty of Education and Social Sciences and a faculty of Health Science and is related to courses building on ideas and theories of innovation/entrepreneurship. In total I have data from 10 teams through observations, video recordings, voice recordings, pictures and interviews. I am about to progress into the data processing phase followed by the analysis thus, I hope, a project presentation at the ECIE PhD Research Colloquium and the feedback related to this can offer inspiration for the further research. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

We look at self-reflectiveness in action. More specifically we study how self-assessment through a reflective task using video clips can trigger and activate entrepreneurial thinking and learning about entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship among BA students in Denmark and Finland. The preliminary findings show that video-clips seem to be a successful way to reveal and trigger reflectiveness among the students. Furthermore, the reflections seem to trigger deeper insights as well as learning and reflection upon and about the entrepreneurial mindset and skills related to the entrepreneurship in a somewhat transformational way. The findings are beneficial for developing EE and for gaining insight into how the students think about entrepreneurship, related skills and becoming entrepreneurs. The video-clip as an examination seems also to be beneficial when both learning about and assessing entrepreneurial thinking. © 2018 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Companies that are positioned in traditional markets of urban infrastructure have to move into these new business fields, in order to ensure long-term competitiveness and survival. Currently, academic frameworks, in particular innovation management, are lacking with which new business fields can be analysed, and recommendations can be developed for mature companies regarding which start-ups in these markets to acquire. This paper presents such a framework, and apply it to the case of the emerging wireless waste monitoring (WWM) and smart water management (SWM) markets. For WWM 8 start-ups are identified. For SWM 9 start-up are identified. A mapping is made between technological building blocks, e.g. sensors and power supply, and solutions, e.g. fault monitoring, actual levels, historic comparisons, predictions. The results presented: (i) Main drivers and barriers for the future development of these markets; (ii) Main actors are in these markets the cross-section between large infrastructural operators and small start-ups:; (iii) Main products, services, and value propositions in these markets are based on systematic uniform property characteristics analysis; (iv) Maturity of the start-ups and firms is in these markets. Based on these results, acquisition recommendations are formulated for a European multinational, and suggestions for further research are provided. The analysis and recommendations represent (v) conversion of early niche-implementations of IoT technologies in to mainstream operations, (vi) interactivity between start-ups and large players pertaining diffusion of technology, (vii) corporate foresight is demonstrated critical in innovation management in combining market leaders and early adopters.

However, teaching business research methodology involves several distinct difficulties. For instance, many methods and approaches, which crosses disciplines, fields and subject matters fall under the category. The subject, thus, resists any simple definition or description. As a consequence, lecturers face a problem of what to teach. It is an impossible task to design a single course or module that covers the whole field of research methodology. Another albeit related problem is how to teach business research methodology. Textbooks have tended to be dominated by instrumental or technical rationality and thus to treat research methodology as the application of methods to technical problems. However, the problem with `methods´ books is that the methods are presented for application as stand-alone procedures, apparently independent of the conceptual and practical issues that arise from studying the actual sites of the events under study. Hence, many textbooks and course descriptions are rooted in an underlying and largely unexamined epistemology of research according to which researchers solve well-formed research problems by applying the theories and techniques of research methodology. In other words, researchers are instrumental problem solvers who select technical means best suited to particular research purposes and projects. In this paper, I will argue that research competence could and should be something more and something else than instrumental competence. Based on a pragmatic reading of Batesons logical categories of learning, I develop a conceptual framework for research competencies in higher education, which highlight that research competence development could and should not limit itself to instrumental competencies. This framework highlights the importance of both instrumentality and contextually in research. Based on a pragmatic reading and further development of Bateson´s logical categories of learning, the paper develops a conceptual framework for competence development in management education, and higher education in general, which includes not only instrumental, but also practical, analytical and critical competencies. The paper develops a conceptual typology of research methodology competencies in higher education, which pinpoints different logical levels of business research methodology that can serve to organise teaching and learning activities. The typology identifies not only instrumental, but also practical, paradigmatic and philosophical competencies. © 2017 Academic Conferences Limited.

These issues are illustrated through an examination of how CSR is operationalized within the commercial banking industry within Tanzania. The commercial banking industry is chosen for review because its operations affect all aspects of the country’s economy and citizenship. Moreover, the regulatory and reporting requirements of commercial banking allow for ample documentation that can be reviewed to assess the industry’s approach to CSR. Like most countries in Africa, Tanzania faces number of environmental and social challenges. These include, but are not limited to, land degradation, climate change, over exploitation of natural resources (e.g. over fishing and mining), illegal timber harvesting and poor access to social services such as education, health services and utilities. Given this situation, commercial banks play a key role in protecting the interests of the community, especially in distributing financial support to various programmes which sustain the environment, communities and their populace. Content analysis of the banks’ annual reports is presented and discussed. Particular attention is given to mission and values statements, board composition, social and philanthropic activities and compliance monitoring.

The root of this situation can be traced back to the need for information integration across construction projects and large operating organisations (see also Chapter 11). Finding new approaches to integrating information between construction projects and large operating organisations should be a major priority in Denmark and many other countries, due to increased pressures for energy reduction. In Denmark, what is referred to as commissioning is one of the up-coming methods for handling this problem. Commissioning is a quality assurance (QA) system that is designed as a component of project delivery. The development of the concept of ‘commissioning’, which has taken place in the Danish building industry, is strongly inspired by the well-established ASHRAE 0-2005 guideline from the United States (US) (Ágústsson and Jensen, 2012). This chapter will draw on the Danish experience of adapting and using this QA model. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Adriana X. Sanchez, Keith D.

Our key proposition here is that shadow banking entities and transaction structures that have developed in and around them are deeply linked to the tax and regulatory flexibility they offer to companies, financial institutions and individuals. Indeed, we suggest that exploring tax arbitrage in particular may help researchers and policy makers to integrate the so-called ‘endogenous’ and ‘exogenous’ explanations of shadow banking (Lysandrou and Nesvetailova 2015). Tax arbitrage helps to mobilize the ability to leverage financial innovations within banking, and reduce taxation costs from forms of financialized assets and income streams, which help to offer both fee income for shadow banking institutions and after-tax yield to bond and securitized asset holders. We also suggest that taxation issues help to bridge another open question about shadow banking - whether these are mainly a monetary or financial phenomenon. One of the key achievements of shadow banking is not so much just that their activities are outside of prudential regulatory spaces, but that they have developed hybrid institutions and instruments that bridge the older descriptive boundaries of money and finance. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Anastasia Nesvetailova; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050318005

This part, thus, offers an insightful collection of chapters reflecting on these key topics with an eye toward incorporating important insights from the past while developing their treatment in novel and forward-looking ways. We begin with a chapter by Brian Fitzgerald and Klaas-Jan Stol, who leverage their extensive knowledge gathered over decades of research into software development (e.g., Fitzgerald, 2006; Fitzgerald and Stol, 2015) to highlight how the current software landscape is being disrupted by elements such as software ecosystems, servitisation, the Internet of Things, parallel processing, cognitive computing and quantum computing. These disruptions mean that organisations are increasingly developing software in environments where they may need to rapidly scale their products, services or systems (to reach new markets and create new offerings), their organisation or business domain (to collaborate with new partners, suppliers or workforce) and their processes and methods (to expand their repertoire of techniques). Software development methods, therefore, need to be adjusted accordingly. This chapter is complemented by the chapter on agility in information systems development by Kieran Conboy, Denis Dennehy, Lorraine Morgan and Roger Sweetman. The chapter provides an excellent overview of the evolution of agile methods (see also Conboy, 2009), followed by the consideration of the next ‘wave’ of agile methods that could also help address many of the present and coming challenges identified in the previous chapter. The readers can find illuminating reflections on questions such as whether agile methods scale to open innovation environments (scaling outside the organisation and in terms of processes) and to whole project portfolios (scaling across a range of products). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Robert D.

In a sense it is mysterious that this entwinement ever disappeared from view. Natural features of the world were originally the central focus of nineteenth-century thinking about geopolitics (e.g., Mackinder 1904), and world politics is by definition a spatial and geographically located affair. Still, the modern discipline of IR, like many social sciences, almost lost sight of nature, rediscovering it gradually from around the 1960s in the form of ‘environmental problems’. In mainstream IR debates, nature became all but invisible. Kenneth Waltz’s abstract model of states in anarchy airbrushed away the geophysical backdrop to neorealist geopolitics. Neoliberal institutionalists also envisioned a world of states suspended in an anarchic structure rather than a concrete geography, and treated the environment as an example of interdependence. Environmental problems were important to regime theory, but remained a relatively ‘low-politics’ category issue, albeit one of considerable interest to problem-solving institutions. Constructivists and post-structuralists with their focus on culture and signification also lacked a strong sense of materiality, not least when compared to the Marxism and historical materialist from whom they largely overtook the disciplinary critical mantle after the end of the Cold War. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Olaf Corry and Hayley Stevenson.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050064755

On the one hand, the corporate political activity (CPA) literature has emphasized that firms interact with governments in a variety of ways, for instance, by trying to influence policy outcomes. On the other hand, recent discussions in the field of corporate social responsibility (CSR) have highlighted that CSR should be understood politically, because firms increasingly provide public goods (e.g., education) and engage in business regulation, thus assuming state-like obligations. While North American scholars were at the forefront of developing the CPA approach (Baron, 2003; Getz, 1997; Hillman, Keim, & Schuler, 2004), European scholars have predominantly shaped the discussion around political CSR (Scherer, Rasche, Palazzo, & Spicer, 2016; Scherer & Palazzo, 2007, 2011; Whelan, 2012). © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050048906

This form of research assessments reverberates through the academic world and leaves its mark on recruitment processes, the daily work of scholars, the knowledge they impart to practitioners and students and the ways in which they project their careers as well as their contributions to the wider research community. Paradoxes abound in this whirlpool of conflicting yet immutable demands. Top journals, while insisting on significant theoretical contribution of papers, also insist on meticulous reviews of previous research, bloated Methods sections and excessive presentations of empirical data, which prevent scholars from properly arguing their theoretical contributions. Paradoxes are also upheld by institutions, which reward publication of papers in top journals where theoretical contribution is demanded, while leaving less time to scholars to engage in research that makes possible those very contributions. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050046014

And given that a quarter of college freshmen still pick business programs, that business faculty members remain in demand, and that business journals and publishers continue to ferret out meaningful research, the legitimacy of this statement would seem indisputable. At the same time, however, US-based experts like Mie Augier and Jim March declare that B schools are stuck between “greed as a social virtue and the substitution of lessons of experience for lessons of analysis and research” (2011, p. 322). Ellen O’Connor (2011) echoes these concerns when she advocates a reconnection with great books popular during the early part of the last century, specifically the work of Mary Parker Follett, a leader in classical management theory, and Chester Barnard, groundbreaking pioneer in management theory and organizational studies. The nostalgia for times when American elites had spiritual stature is also identifiable in Harvard Business School professor Rakesh Khurana’s From Higher Aims to Hired Hands (2009); he concludes that US business schools fall short in turning out managers who achieve “meaning from their work”, and even worse, are unable to “creat[e] meaning for others”. Moneymaking overshadows the quest for professional value, and curricular absorption in profit-making strategies leaves little room for the ethical development of future managers. Even though admissions data, professional job openings and research opportunities seem healthy, something is amiss in the picture. Recalibrating the benchmarks for business education requires a moral rearmament against the harsh instrumentality that serves outright greed. In most current American writing on business education, for example, management scholars are encouraged to staunch the tide of the value-drowning philosophy that corrupts their curricula; their responsibility is to evangelize the good and offer students the entertaining fictions of dreaming up a better world before stepping into their personal reality of paying off humongous student loans and taking up positions in US corporations pretending to operate in spheres separate from societal politics (Rasche, 2014). Following the narrative turn in research, good samples of poetic vision and 88excellent storytelling (Czarniawska-Joerges & Guillet de Monthoux, 1994; Dewandre, 2002; Rombach & Solli, 2006; Sköldberg, 2002) do exist in the works of mainly European management scholars, however, and so it may be that the alleged solution to the business school crises could in fact be a cause of future bankruptcies in research and education. Four Euro-based perspectives can help management scholars effect the transition from narrative speculative fictions to a more promising speculative realism constantly empirically preoccupied with searching the soul of relevance for European management research (Hernes, 2014b). © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050040198

Government officials, regional and economic specialists, and international trade advisers are directly involved in assisting small and medium-sized enterprises in developing their international marketing expertise. Motivating SMEs to Cooperate and Internationalize consists of research studies, cases, and experiences obtained by researchers and academics from managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Europe as they worked closely with managers on issues and problems leading to internationalization of enterprises. This book will map not only the attempts of small and medium-sized enterprises in Northern Europe to enter foreign markets, but also to understand how researchers and academics can help small and medium-sized Northern European enterprisers achieve their objectives. This compilation of approaches, perspectives, and experiences will serve as a resource tool for researchers and academics active in international management training programs worldwide and help illustrate how to close the gap between publishing results of their findings and efforts to disseminate their findings among managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in their domains. This book is the first attempt to integrate results of research studies and practices as an illustration of how knowledge of small and medium-sized enterprises has evolved since the 1980s with the contributions of individual researchers and academics in Northern Europe.

It has been consistently argued in the extant SME literature that a firm’s decision to seek and take advantage of international business opportunities depends partly on its ownership configuration and its ability to leverage strategic capabilities and resources (Donckels and Fröhlich 1991; Gallo and García-Pont 1996; Hitt et al. 1997; Peng, 2001; Zahra 2003). With regard to ownership, the understanding is that family-owned businesses tend to be more constrained in their access to financial resources than nonfamily firms (Gallo and García-Pont 1996). But the strong relational networks and social capital, which constitute dominant characteristic of family businesses, tend to compensate for their resource disadvantages. For example, employees of family businesses are reputed for their strong sense of duty towards their businesses (Astrachan 2010) and this encourages them to adopt non-traditional growth-enhancing strategies (Abdellatif et al. 2010; Kontinen and Ojala 2010; Kotey and Folker 2007; Okoroafo and Koh 2010). Thus, the differences between family and nonfamily-owned businesses are significant enough to require research attention, especially in investigations of the internationalization processes of small firms. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049940074

This chapter presents the national innovation system as a ŉew combination’ that has evolved and been reinvented by connecting it to new fields of theory and empirical research by scholars operating in disparate fields of enquiry. We start by referring to the very first contributions that made use of the concept - Freeman (1982) who emphasized the link between innovation and international trade and Lundvall (1985) who emphasized network formation and interactive learning at the national level. We use these quite disparate, but complementary, contributions to discuss some of the future paths of evolution of the concept. At the end of the chapter we relate the two original contributions to the literature on global value chains and we argue that combining the understanding of interactive learning and national innovation systems with the global value chain perspective is one way to reestablish the critical potential of the original ideas that became diluted in connection with the wide diffusion of the concept. We also argue that combining the innovation system and the value chain perspective is useful when it comes to developing a more satisfactory understanding of how countries can evade the poverty trap and the middle-income trap. © Harald Bathelt, Patrick Cohendet, Sebastian Henn and Laurent Simon 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049551557

Classic examples include citizens reporting crimes to the police and parents helping students with school attendance and homework. A growing literature shows that citizen participation in public service delivery – also known as citizen coproduction – can in fact increase the quality and efficiency of public services (Brudney 1983; Jakobsen and Andersen 2013). We still know little about what motivates citizens to participate in public service delivery. Some scholars simply assume that citizens are more likely to coproduce if it mainly benefits themselves (Percy 1984). If this is true, simply informing citizens about the personal benefits of coproducing should motivate them to coproduce more. In this chapter, we discuss three sources of citizen coproduction. First, we discuss how information about personal benefits can motivate citizens to coproduce. Second, we argue that citizen coproduction can be increased by providing citizens with the necessary resources to engage in coproduction. Third, we argue that changes in the level of public input may have an independent effect on citizen coproduction due to substitution or complementary effects. However, studying the antecedents of citizen coproduction is challenging. Problems of endogeneity weaken the internal validity of empirical studies based on observational data. Public initiatives aimed at enhancing citizen participation in the production and delivery of public services may target specific groups of citizens (either the most needy or the most resourceful in terms of coproduction), which will introduce selection bias in the identification of a causal effect. For example, if a school seeks to increase parents’ involvement in homework for children with low test scores, it is quite likely that we will observe a negative correlation between exposure to the initiative and test scores, even if the increased involvement has a positive effect – simply because the targeted children had lower scores to begin with. We argue that these problems can be addressed through the use of experimental methods. Based on a discussion of three field experiments conducted by the authors, we find that the more expensive initiatives (providing resources and increasing public sector input) can be effective, while the cheaper and frequently used alternative (providing information) is not. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048179563

Testing the effects of leadership on performance is difficult, however, as the two concepts influence each other in complex and reciprocal ways, creating a potential endogeneity problem in non-experimental leadership research. Consequently, the extent to which leadership actually affects performance is unclear despite the large number of leadership studies (Antonakis et al. 2010; Knippenberg and Sitkin 2013). Experimental designs can provide more systematic knowledge about the causal effects of leadership, enabling us to decrease absenteeism, increase performance, and attract and retain more motivated employees to the public sector (Park and Rainey 2008). It is therefore important to discuss how we best can use experiments to study leadership in public administration and management. Vogel and Masal find that ‘Transformational public leadership’ and ‘Outcomes of public leadership’ are dominant themes (Vogel and Masal 2014: 8). The literature on the outcomes of public leadership typically analyses various performance measures on which public leadership may have an impact, while the transformational leadership literature focuses more on measuring specific aspects of leader behaviour. Studies of transformational leadership and performance reflect both of these strands of leadership literature, and we will therefore pay special attention to these lines of research. A transformational leader develops a vision with core goals for the organisation, strives to share this vision with the employees, and works to sustain the shared vision in the short and long run (Jacobsen and Andersen 2015: 4). Existing research has consistently found transformational leadership is positively associated with employee performance (Trottier et al. 2008; Wofford et al. 2001), but few studies (e.g., Bellé 2014; Dvir et al. 2002) are able to make causal conclusions. Such conclusions should be based on an experimental design. As Blom-Hansen and colleagues (2015) noted, studying transformational leadership in observational studies is notoriously difficult, because leaders may react to past performance by adjusting their leadership strategies, and external factors may affect both leadership strategy and performance. Using experiments to estimate the effects of transformational leadership is therefore extremely relevant. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048178504

Unlike topics covered in many of the chapters in this book, the topic is relatively new, and while observational studies of performance information use precede experimental work, the temporal gap is small. The topic therefore allows us to consider how experimental and observational work approach the same empirical phenomenon in approximately the same time frame. In some respects, the study of performance information use is a natural fit with the broader trend towards experiments discussed in this book, as it reflects a behavioural approach to studying public management. Moynihan and Pandey (2010: 852) ‘conceptualise performance information use as a form of organisational behaviour’ that could be explained by studying individual, job, organisational, and environmental factors. By contrast, the study of performance management more broadly has traditionally centred on the study of particular reforms and initiatives, and broad assessments on whether they appeared to have been working or not (e.g., Radin 2012). A shortcoming of such work is that it typically excluded attention to micro-foundational bases for how public officials actually make use of performance data. Performance management reforms have consistently sought to improve government effectiveness and accountability, but the central and frequently unspoken assumption is that such improvement requires a particular type of behaviour: that public officials incorporate performance data into their judgments and decisions. But whether and how public officials use data, and under what conditions, are questions which until recently were virtually unaddressed. This is why performance information use has been characterised as a ‘big question’ (Moynihan and Pandey 2010) for the broader study of performance management, reflecting Van Dooren's (2008: 22) claim that ‘if we want to study the successes and failures of performance movements, we have to study the use of performance information.’ The question of performance information use is important not just for the study of performance management, or even administration generally, but also for policy and governance. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048171691

The purpose of this paper is to suggest that HQ-subsidiary distance is an important factor that affects such ability; this report also investigates the impact of distance on the HQ’s network management capabilities in the context of a global organisation’s evolution. Design/methodology/approach – In this study, a single company was chosen to take part in a retrospective, longitudinal case study that highlighted two embedded product cases. The concept of distance was viewed as a variety of distance dimensions existing between the HQ and its subsidiaries. Findings – The results indicated that distance impacted the effectiveness of the HQ’s network management capabilities by affecting HQ-subsidiary interaction and, consequently, shaping HQ’s knowledgeability about the subsidiaries’ operations. Moreover, the results suggested that the impact of such distance may shift from positive to negative over the course of a global organisation’s evolution. Research limitations/implications – Although this study was explorative, some generalisability to industrial-goods companies of Scandinavian origin that have transferred activities to their owned subsidiaries may be expected. Further replication of the study using multiple case companies across various industries and countries is desirable. Originality/value – This work extends the understanding of technological distance, sheds light on the conditions necessary for the HQ of a globally networked organisation to engage in value creation in the context of its evolution and contributes to the overall appreciation of distance as a factor that comprises multiple dimensions. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Capabilities; Distance; Relationships","Industrial research; Product design; Capability; Design/methodology/approach; Distance; Global organization; Longitudinal case study; Management capabilities; Multinational enterprise; Networks management; Relationship; S networks; Network management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047338073

However, the literature suffers from insufficient discussion concerning how differences in industry clockspeed affect innovation-fostering practices and innovation performance of firms. We address this unexplored issue in this paper by means of a comparative case study. We investigate the innovation-fostering practices of two firms, one in a low clock-speed industry and the other in a high clock-speed industry, to delineate the differences and similarities. The principal conclusion reached is that while industry clock-speed does not affect the innovation-fostering practices per se, the ways in which the practices are utilised differ greatly, which we detail based on the case studies. The differences pertain to open versus closed innovation, network ties, controlled versus flexible approaches, formal versus informal knowledge management systems, external knowledge integration and absorptive capacity. Our study informs both theory and practice of innovation-fostering practices in industries that differ in clock-speeds. © 2017 Kedge Business School.","Case study; Industrial clock-speed; Innovation-fostering practices; Supply network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045920622

This information potentially affects citizens’ perceptions of services and their interaction with services and their associated institutions, especially political voice, including voting and lobbying, and choice of service (Dowding and John 2012; Hood 2006; James 2011a; Olsen 2015c). Recently a strand of experimental research has developed on this topic analysing citizens and users’ contact with performance information, how they make sense of it, the effects on them, and their responses (Bækgaard and Serritzlew 2016; James 2011a, 2011b; James and Van Ryzin 2017a, 2017b; Olsen 2015a, 2015c). This chapter identifies the contribution made by experimental methods, including in combination with psychologically informed public administration theory, towards understanding these processes and outcomes and the potential of this approach. The experimental method is especially valuable in this context because non-experimental, observational, methods struggle to identify the causal effects of performance information on citizens. Performance information varies in its availability, format of presentation, and incorporation of benchmarks for comparison in ways that are often correlated with a range of factors. Notably, differences in performance information are often related to variation in service sector, type of audience, saliency of the measure, policy makers’ incentives for presenting data in a certain manner, or citizens’ use of information. These factors are often themselves correlated with the effects of performance information per se, making it difficult for researchers using observational methods to disentangle the effects of the information from the influence of these other factors. For example, citizens who are already favourably disposed towards a public service may be more likely to seek out information about it. An observational study unable to control for this latent characteristic risks conflating citizens’ initial disposition with the effect of being exposed to performance information about the service. Experimental research offers a promising way of understanding how citizens are influenced by performance information. This information is a factor that is relatively easy to manipulate experimentally, in contrast to both macro-institutional features of the public sector, for example the form of governmental system, and citizens’ own personal characteristics, for example socioeconomic status or gender. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044091707

The article shows how ‘trading health for money’ becomes a mode for maintaining positive social, occupational and masculine identity among construction workers. Furthermore, it shows how the agency of the body is overruled by the intra-acting agencies of productivity, collegiality, job security and masculine working-class identity. Finally, it shows an instability in this configuration of masculine working-class identity that leaves room for a focus on the body. © The Author(s) 2016.","Agency; Body; Construction work; Embodiment; Masculinity; Pain; Work; Working class",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043762539

As a central application in a biostatistical context, Kaplan-Meier integrals are used to estimate transition probabilities in a non-Markov illness-death model. We extend already existing approaches by introducing a novel estimator that also works in the presence of additional left truncation.

With the workings of global markets at odds with fostering cosmopolitan social change, this collection addresses the question of whether we should assume that market logics and consumptive practices conflict with cosmopolitan agendas. It also explores whether the imperatives of economic globalisation and individual consumption practices are opposed to cosmopolitan prospects for global solidarities.

It thereby contributes to understandings of the sociomaterial inscriptions of cosmopolitanism as related to retail brand ideology, branded and themed spaces. By examining cosmopolitanism as an ideology that informs the servicescape, we suggest a shift away from understanding the consumption of cosmopolitanism as a descriptive inventory of consumer traits, preferences, and behaviors, to instead understanding cosmopolitanism as a value proposition?a ludic space where cosmopolitan consumers can identify with and exercise their cosmopolitan tastes and practices. We explore how the servicescape transforms when it is charged with cosmopolitanism through an investigation of the celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, who claims Ethiopian, Swedish, and American identities, and the spatial and visual strategies that configure cosmopolitanism in his restaurant Red Rooster Harlem. Our findings draw from interviews with Samuelsson, representations of Samuelsson and the Red Rooster Harlem in the popular media, Samuelsson’s own cookbooks, and analysis of the floor plan and design of Samuelsson’s restaurant. By analyzing how the servicescape offers narrative templates and resources for cosmopolitan consumers’ experience and re-construction of identity, we link current thinking about cosmopolitanism with the sociomaterial construction of the servicescape and open new avenues for understanding ideological servicescapes. © The Author(s) 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042757488

This approach challenges the dominant role of lengthy business plans, linear product development processes, and seeking complete overview of the potential of the new products/services before market launch. Instead it suggests that start-ups could benefit from a ‘minimum-viable product’ approach where products and services are launched when they contain critical features. The emphasis in the lean start-up approach is on business models rather than the elaborate business plan. This chapter is based on the in-depth case studies from three established companies that have all sought to employ a minimum-viable product approach to developing and launching new products. The data will consist of rich interview data from the three companies and observations from various events at the companies (strategy meetings, development workshops etc.). The aim is to shed light on the implications for companies that seek to employ lean start-up.

A wide range of indoor environmental scenarios can be simulated under precisely controlled conditions, and human subjects can be selected based on pre-defined criteria. The degree of control over experiments is high and a large number of physical, physiological, and psychological quantities can be monitored. This chapter gives an overview of various types of test facilities in the world and their main features in terms of experimental opportunities. It then presents typical technical equipment and sensor technologies used in laboratory environments. Finally, questions on appropriate laboratory design and experimental set-ups are discussed. One conclusion is that, in spite of many advantages, there are limits to investigating occupant behavior in a laboratory’s “artificial” environment, in part due to the fact that subjects always feel observed to some extent. However, valuable results can be achieved if the specific opportunities of laboratories are utilized both by appropriate design and precise experiments during operation. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042408673

Within this chapter, first, a nomenclature for the field of research dealing with occupants in buildings is defined. This nomenclature distinguishes between occupants’ presence and behavior, states and actions, adaptive triggers, non-adaptive triggers, and contextual factors. Second, an extensive list of occupant behaviors is provided and categorizations of occupants’ actions are introduced. The list includes most of the possible phenomena that researchers may wish to study, measure, and ultimately model. The categories are physiological, individual, environmental, and spatial adjustments. Third, a list of adaptive and non-adaptive triggers together with contextual factors that could influence occupant behavior is presented. Individual elements are further grouped into physical environmental, physiological, psychological, and social aspects. Finally, a comprehensive table of studies related to occupant behavior and the corresponding significant and non-significant predictors, based on an extensive literature review, is shown. This table highlights areas of research where numerous studies have been conducted, as well as areas where hardly any research has been published. The conclusion highlights the importance of publishing future occupant monitoring campaigns with sufficient detail to inform future researchers and save redundant effort. Such detail is especially necessary in relation to the methodology, including, for example, a clear description of the type of variables monitored, and in relation to the results, where both the influencing factors that were found to be significant and insignificant should be documented. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042396260

This article attempts to fill the gap by studying 184 merger announcements from 1995 to 2014. Our findings differ in a number of ways. “First, we extend the current literature since we find that diversifying acquisitions” generate a higher bidder abnormal return compared with focused transactions. A possible explanation is that in diversifying acquisitions acquirers overpay for target firms within their core industry because they overestimate operational synergies. The managerial implication is that the notion of core business should not restrict diversified value-enhancing M&As. Secondly, we find evidence that bidder abnormal returns depend not on the method of payment. The implication is that bidders may have more flexibility with regard to the financing of deals in the Nordic countries, because the acquirer’s managers do not have to take into account any negative market reactions with regard to the payment method. Thirdly, we explore the relationship between cash flows and abnormal returns. Our results confirm current literature since we find that low-valued bidders with excessive free cash flows experience negative returns prior to an announcement. Furthermore, our results imply that a bidder company must be able convincingly to justify an acquisition to the market by communicating the presence of a sound and coherent integration plan. © 2017, International Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

We compare the evolutions of new markets in China for gas-powered two-wheeled vehicles (G2WVs) based (initially) on closed-system proprietary architectures and for electric-powered two-wheeled vehicles (E2 WVs) based on open-system modular architectures. We draw on this comparison to suggest ways in which the use of the two different kinds of architectures as the basis for new kinds of products may result in very different patterns and speeds of new market formation. We then suggest some key implications of the different dynamics of market formation associated with open-system modular architectures for both the competence-based strategic management (CBSM) of firms and for technology and economic development policies of governments. Specifically, we suggest how the use of open-system modular product architectures as the basis for new products is likely to result in dynamics of new market formation that call for new approaches to the strategic management of innovation and product creation. We also suggest technology and economic development policies favoring use of open-system modular architectures may stimulate new market formation and related economic development by providing platforms for accelerating technology development and dissemination, facilitating the formation of an industrial base of assemblers and component suppliers, assisting new firms in building customer relationships, enabling more geographically diffused economic development within countries, and facilitating development of export markets. We also suggest directions for further research into the potential for open-system modular product architectures to enable bottom-ofthepyramid innovation processes, frugal engineering in developing economies, and development of low-cost product variations more generally.

We then elaborate and contrast epistemologies for (i) building ""grand theory"" intended to be applicable to all cases and contexts, and (ii) building ""mid-range theory"" intended to apply to specific kinds of contexts. We illustrate the epistemological challenges in building grand theory in management science by considering important differences in the abilities of two ""grand theories"" in strategic management - industry structure theory and firm resources theory - to support development of conceptually consistent models and propositions for empirical testing, theoretical refinement, and application in management practice. We then suggest how a mid-range theory building approach can help to achieve integration of the two grand strategic management theories and improve their ability to support empirical testing, theory refinement, and application of theory inpractice.

Our model explores sources of cognitive flexibility of boards needed to recognize and respond to the need for improved sustainability performance. We first define concepts of sustainability, sustainability competence, and sustainability performance. We then analyze two forms of board capital (a board's human capital and its social capital) and three aspects of a board's information processing (its patterns of information search, discussion and debate, and information absorption) that we suggest affect a board's cognitive flexibility and thereby influence whether a board decides to adopt sustainability performance goals. Our model also suggests that an organization's strategic flexibility - as represented by its current endowments of resource flexibilities and coordination flexibilities - will moderate the relationship between a board's decision to adopt sustainability performance goals and an organization's subsequent achievement of those goals. We also suggest that our model is generally relevant to any research seeking to predict the influence of boards on strategic change in many forms, not just to research focused on sustainability issues.

To achieve sustained competitive success, a firm's competence building processes must continuously renew and extend the competences a firm has andean leverage. However, the ability of a firm to sustain strategically adequate levels of competence building - while also maintaining strategically successful competence leveraging - may be limited by various self-reinforcing managerial and organizational mechanisms that can arise from competence leveraging processes. In this paper we focus on certain managerial behaviors that may create path dependencies that lead an organization to become ""locked-in"" to its current competence leveraging processes and to neglect essential competence building, resulting in an inability to renew competences at a strategically adequate level and eventually in competitive failure. In order to avoid such consequences, the management literature suggests that organizations must cultivate dynamic capabilities to overcome tendencies toward lock-in and to sustain ongoing competence building. This study investigates ways in which firms can maintain healthy competence building processes by avoiding lock-ins, especially those resulting from self-reinforcing managerial behaviors. A case study of successful competence-renewing processes in a home improvement retailing company helps to amplify the components of dynamic capabilities and to illustrate the insights that emerge from our study.

Empirically, we investigated the theorization process of a highly disruptive innovation in the history of architecture: reinforced concrete. Relying on archival data from a prominent French architectural journal in the period from 1885 to 1939, we studied the rhetorical modes at play in the theorization of reinforced concrete. First, we found that theorization entailed two recursive activities: dramatization and evaluation. While dramatization relies on both verbal and visual (i.e., multimodal) means, evaluation relies on verbal means. We integrated these components into a dynamic model of theorization that explains how visual discourse contributes to theorization beyond the effects of verbal discourse.

SMEs are often argued to be sensitive to shocks, but have likewise been suggested to be a source of economic resilience owing to their flexibility and their ability to change after a shock. The chapter argues that one must distinguish between the ability of SMEs to resist to external shocks and the ability of SMEs to recover from such shocks. These two abilities are labelled as the vulnerability and adaptability of SMEs. Both abilities can be managed through strategic and operational actions, but SMEs face several trade-offs, as they must balance concerns over short-term profits with the need for robustness and flexibility as well as innovation and learning. The chapter further includes an analysis of a sample of Danish SMEs in the period following the recession of 2009. The analysis demonstrates that, while SMEs may be vulnerable, many SMEs are also able to recover from a major shock to their economy. It is thus suggested that the vulnerability of SMEs to shocks should not be seen by policymakers as a sign of permanent decline. Recovery and renewed growth may follow at a later stage. © Nick Williams and Tim Vorley 2017., All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040671497

They take the English Premier League as their test case and focus on the two largest UK bookmakers. The findings are most interesting. First, over-rounds have fallen over time. Second, this reduction is attributable to the emergence of a betting exchange, Betfair, which has become increasingly popular in the UK. Third, perhaps surprisingly, the reduced commissions are not related to the growth of online bookmakers in the UK. Thus, it is increased competition from the betting exchange and not from online bookmakers that has exerted downward pressure on bookmaker over-rounds. © Plácido Rodríguez, Brad R.

The study aims to investigate the factors that contribute to business intelligence (BI) success. 1,352 BI endusers answered the questionnaire. A partial least square structural equation model was used to empirically test the model. We find that system quality is positively and significantly associated with use and user satisfaction, and that information quality is positively and significantly associated with user satisfaction. User satisfaction is positively and significantly related to individual impact. The other paths in the model are insignificant. Our findings also provide empirical support for the role of user satisfaction as a mechanism that mediates the relationship between information quality or system quality and individual impact. User satisfaction is not only a critical construct in the information systems success model but it also serves as a mediator. Generally, the model finds empirical support, as it has a good fit and predictive value. © 2017, SciKA.","Business intelligence; Evaluation; Healthcare information system; IS success; Quantitative method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040165381

First, we introduce the concepts of empowerment, action research and social innovation along with the roots of these concepts in critical social theory. Secondly, two case studies are presented to analyse two different methodological variants of action research in two different contexts. The first case is about action research in nursing homes, where the objective was to improve elder care through more autonomy and better quality of life for residents and employees. In this project (inspired by critical utopian action research), so called ‘future workshops’ were applied to create “free space” for reflection and creation of concrete suggestions of social innovation in elder care. The second case is about the transformation of a public library into a community centre. In this case, the aim was to break down barriers between citizens and public institutions in a deprived, multicultural urban area and thereby promote local community empowerment. In this project, ‘empowerment evaluation’ was used as an action research method. In the final part we compare the two approaches (utopian action research and empowerment facilitation), and discuss the danger of falling into the trap of localism, where successful social innovations: instead of being up-scaled and widely distributed, end up as oneoffs or simply die out at the very local level © 2017, Rainer Hampp Verlag.

The analysis identifies principal limitations, such as an excess of outcome-oriented indicators, as well as practical constraints, including the limited capacity of National Statistical Offices (NSOs) to provide disaggregated data. The findings suggest that there will be significant data gaps in the monitoring framework for years to come. However, some of the critical gaps can be filled with available data from other sources, including human rights monitoring bodies. This requires building a ""pluralistic ecosystem of data"" that incorporates data from credible third parties, including citizens and private sector entities.

For instance, the strong sense that the event has educational value and showcased the arctic region for tourism were important considerations for volunteers becoming paying guests. Although age nor gender of the volunteers was a factor, those who were better educated and had greater satisfaction from volunteering were likely to pay to attend. These findings highlight the need for a theoretical framework to further examine these issues. Future research using a mixed-methods approach can also help to understand more holistically what volunteers value and how their experience shapes the need for different experiences. © 2017 Cognizant, LLC.","Arctic winter games; Benefits; Binary regression; Volunteer's intention; Willingness to pay",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037639003

Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on Judith Butler's work and her notion of excitability to explain how multiple values may arise when accounting interacts with innovation. Through this lens, accounting, as a language based on signs, can be theorised as an ex-citable force involved in provoking and transforming innovation and its associated values, notably beyond innovators' initial intentions. Thus, innovation is not a stable object but a pervasive movement diffusing multiple values. Findings - By introducing the notion of pervasiveness, the paper argues that even if values can be imagined ab origine, they may not be contractible to a plan. The calculative instruments of accounting provoke innovation and participate in the generation of value(s) by activating processes that pervade everything rather than being limited to categorical spaces. In the course of this pervasive process, innovations, which are born to develop private interests, can possibly generate public goods. Originality/value - The notion of pervasiveness the paper advances is used to challenge the division between business and social innovation. It well expresses the effects that ex-citable calculative practices put in place when interacting with innovation. It suggests that it is only possible to create productions - to assemble things - in ongoing processes, and the value(s) produced in such movements are always evolving and multiple. However, in this sense, they are social. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accounting; Innovation; Perfomativity; Pervasiveness; Values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035363786

The impact was a relative reduction between 8% and 21% in direct labour costs for the contractor, which equals a 1% reduction in client costs. Thus, the potential gain from increasing productivity are relatively higher for the contractor than for the client.

In this study of Knotworking, the focus has been on how the participating organizations and professionals can learn how to participate in knotworking. A facilitator was introduced to establish how facilitators can assist the participating organizations in a construction project to learn to produce knowledge and innovation through knotworking. The theoretical foundation is Activity Theory, the data collection method derives from applied ethnomethodology using a blend of video recording and participant observation. The data has been collected in a series of planning meetings and one workshop about building a new kindergarten. The analysis of data shows that the open-endedness of the process was difficult to handle for the participants, as they wanted to return to old norms and routine that overrule the knotworking process. The major result is that the use of a facilitator can functions as a catalyst helping the participant exploiting the openings for knotworking by encouraging people to bring in their resources and tools in new ways and in this way increase innovation.","Activity theory; Construction industry; Facilitation; Knotworking","Activity coefficients; Construction industry; Video recording; Activity Theory; Data collection method; Emerging collaboration; Facilitation; Innovation in construction; Knotworking; Participant observations; Theoretical foundations; Project management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035326899

With the model companies in the construction industry are able to make an assessment of their own development potential regarding strategic collaboration and be guided in their further development.","Building renovation; Maturity model; Strategic collaboration; Sustainability","Construction industry; Intelligent buildings; Project management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Building renovation; Development potential; Level of integrations; Maturity model; Research tools; Strategic collaboration; Sustainable building; Sustainable construction; Quality control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035315032

Rarely, is sociological theory mobilized to appreciate the complexity of a project's performance. However, a design-build project's performance can be conceptualized through the lens of institutional work and as a result, be understood as an emerging constellation of multiple institutions. To understand potential relationships between institutional processes and project performance, an ex-post study was conducted of two completed design-build projects. The ex-post study was based on interviews carried out with key participants from the two design-build projects. While each project developed multiple relationships between institutions over the course of the project, the projects were characterized by particular constellations of institutions which we denote 'settled domination' and 'conflict and competition'. Settled domination resulted in project performance that pre-dominantly satisfied the dominant institutions while project participants expected and more-or-less accepted that remaining institutions were compromised. Conflict and competition resulted in project performance characterized by a mix of compromised and uncompromised institutions. Overall, the two projects show that project performance is an emerging qualitative concept that gradually settles during the aftermath of the building phase.","Institutional process; Institutional work; Project performance","Model buildings; Project management; Balanced scorecards; Design-build projects; Institutional process; Institutional work; Project participants; Project performance; Sociological theories; Through the lens; Societies and institutions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035310984

The authors strive to complement these methods by a quantitative approach. First, gender role stereotypes were measured in entrepreneurship. Second, the explicit notions of participants were captured when they described entrepreneurs. Therefore, this paper aims to revisit gender role stereotypes among young adults. Design/methodology/approach: To measure stereotyping, participants were asked to describe entrepreneurs in general and either women or men in general. The Schein Descriptive Index (SDI) for characterization was used. Following the procedures of Schein (1975), intra-class-correlation was calculated as a measure of congruence. This approach was complemented by controlling explicit notions, i.e. the image that participants had when describing entrepreneurs. Findings: The images of men and entrepreneurs show a high and significant congruence (r = 0.803), mostly in those adjectives that are untypical for men and entrepreneurs. The congruence of women and entrepreneurs was low (r = 0.152) and insignificant. Contrary to the participants’ beliefs, their explicit notions did not have any effect on measures of congruence. However, young adults who knew business owners in their surroundings rated the congruence of women and entrepreneurs significantly higher (r = 0.272) than average. Originality/value: This study is unique in combining “implicit” stereotypes and explicit notions. It demonstrates that gender stereotypes in entrepreneurship are powerful. The image of the entrepreneur remains male, independent of explicit notions. As young adults who knew business owners in their surroundings rated the congruence of women and entrepreneurs higher, this could be a starting point for education programmes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Doing gender; Entrepreneurship; Gender role stereotype; Gender theory; Masculine norm; Schein Descriptive Index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035218507

The purpose of this study is to provide empirically based knowledge about the organization of the use of ICT and dilemmas of this increasingly common practice in healthcare. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on observations, interviews and desk research in relation to a large €4.5m pilot project at four hospitals in Copenhagen regarding care of 120 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). The empirical study was carried out over four months. Online video consultations were observed alongside workshops focusing on nurses’ photo elucidation of the telecare practice. The analytical ambition was to start the study in the middle of things and explore the emergent design of telecare. Findings: Telecare not only embraces new standards and possibilities for professional responsibility and accountability for nurses but also alters the relationship between doctors and nurses. This leads to a dilemma we characterize as “paradoxical accountability”. Originality/value: The study draws on Star’s notion of “infrastructure”. In this perspective, infrastructure comprises human and non-human conduct embedded in organizational conventions, relations and sites. The analysis demonstrates that nurses are not only exposed to a new responsibility as all-round case managers but they also have less access to clinical decision makers. The notion of “paradoxical accountability” is developed to account for this dilemma. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Health-care service; Information technology; Innovation; New technology; Organizational processes; Standards",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034865918

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the uncertainty exposure in servitized triads and explore suitable organisational responses. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual frame is defined detailing three uncertainty types (environmental, organisational and relational uncertainty) and suitable organisational responses to these. This frame guided the analysis of in-depth case evidence from a cross-national servitized triad in a European-North African set-up which was collected through 29 semi-structured interviews and secondary data. Findings: The empirical study identified the existence of the three uncertainty types and directional knock-on effects between them. Specifically, environmental uncertainty created organisational uncertainty which in turn created relational uncertainty. The uncertainty types were reduced through targeted organisational responses where formal relational governance reduced environmental uncertainty, service capabilities reduced organisational uncertainty and informal relational governance reduced relational uncertainty. The knock-on effects were reduced through organisational and relational responses. Originality/value: This paper makes two contributions. First, a structured analysis of the uncertainty exposure in servitized triads is presented which shows the existence of three individual uncertainty types and the knock-on effects between them.

This diversity influences the effectiveness of different manufacturing practices, which has not yet been explored in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between plant role and the “goodness” of its manufacturing practices. Design/methodology/approach: Data are used from a sample of 471 plants from the sixth edition of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey. Findings: The findings show that plants with higher competences use more practices successfully than less competent plants. Furthermore, more competent plants tend to strengthen their differentiation performance, while less competent plants focus on and achieve cost performance improvements instead. Practical implications: The associations between plant role, manufacturing practices and performance provide important input for the global design of a firm’s IMN as a whole, and the development of local plants within the network. Originality/value: The “goodness” of manufacturing practices has not been investigated in the plant role literature; the effect of plant role on the “goodness” of manufacturing practices has not been studied in the OM contingency literature. This paper shows that while the role of a plant in a firm’s IMN hardly affects the efforts it puts into implementing different manufacturing practices, it has an important moderating influence on the performance implications of these practices. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Manufacturing network; Manufacturing practices; Performance; Plant role; Survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034807991

The EU is at the forefront of international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission as one of the most important global challenges, and the mentioned regulatory role of the EU is illustrated in this article by three examples related to GHG emissions from transport: The EU’s use of the ‘cap and trade’ principle on all aircrafts that arrive or depart from its territory; the EU’s proposal on the use of monitoring, reporting and verifications (MRV) obligations on all ships that arrive or depart from its territory; and the EU’s use of mandatory sustainability criteria on all biofuels used by road traffic. These examples involve transnational regulation of private sector actors. The EU ambitions are to ensure a model for global norms in situations, where the international regimes are ineffective. The EU legislator has the European Court of Justice’s word for its right to permit a commercial activity to be carried out by foreign enterprises only on its territory provided that the operators comply with the EU norms; and it has the Court’s word for its right to act with exclusive external competences to ensure an export of the norms also in situations where it is the Member States of the EU-and not the EU- that are the accepted parties of the international organisation that the EU wants to push. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034412105

This requires them to deal with probabilities and complex information. Personal norms are an individual’s felt obligations toward a certain behaviour. There is an increasing volume of research demonstrating the usefulness of the social norms approach as a means to regulate environmental behaviour.

So far, research has come up with diverging empirical results. There seems, however, to be agreement on one point: the economic impact of immigration is strongly dependent on who the immigrants turn out to be. Thus, the skill-based sorting of immigrants into various host countries can be expected to be highly relevant. Borjas has proposed a sorting model in which the skill composition of migration depends on the second moments of the income distribution in the sending and the receiving countries, provided that skills and income are correlated in both. Previous empirical tests of this model have failed to turn up consistent results. Using data from the OECD Migration Database on the educational levels of immigrants from EU-15 countries into other EU-15 countries the paper shows that the skill-based sorting of this immigration is consistent with the core prediction from the Roy-Borjas model. This result also obtains after control for network (or herd) effects, which are often marshaled as alternative explanations of the locational decisions of immigrants. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034405695

In contrast, previous work typically assumes simple random death. The central driver of the model dynamics-creating the endogenous exit decision of firms-is the inclusion of exogenous economy wide technological progress. Thus our framework contains vintage capital properties and accordingly creative destruction of old firms by new firms. The model predicts-inter alia-that a higher relative productivity increases not only the likelihood of exporting, but also the chances of firm survival and continued export market engagements. We relate the model predictions to the empirical stylized facts of export market exit and firm survival based on Danish firm-level data. Overall, our empirical results support the central predictions from the model. First, productivity is a good predictor for survival. Secondly, firms experience a decline in market share prior to death and export market exit. Thirdly, firms that die or quit their exporting activity are small. Fourthly, small firms constitute the largest share of exits in a given cohort. Fifthly, the productivity distribution of survivors first-order dominates the one of exiting firms on both domestic and export markets. Finally, we confirm that a large share of firms which stop exporting continue to exist as pure domestic firms. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034397151

The empirical findings related in this paper present circumstantial evidence that Japanese foreign aid has contributed to globalization over the past 60 years by establishing channels for interactions, exchanges, interdependencies, and the circulation of persons. Notably, it analyzes the networks that have been deliberately encouraged by Japanese aid among alumni from Japanese training courses since 1959. The analyses are based on alumni newsletters since 1961, alumni societies since 1964, and alumni conventions since 1986 that distinguish Japanese aid programs by being formal and permanent channels of communication. This is a typical positive externality that is difficult to capture in the usual aid effectiveness studies, because it works in the longer run and in ways that are unrelated to individual projects. The main argument is that the formal channels have provided the alumni with a network, which they can choose to activate for concrete impact. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034391913

The analysis supports that a larger public sector (higher tax rate) tends to increase wages and worsen wage competitiveness. However, the implications of product market integration for the public sector are far from straightforward. The reason is gainsfrom- trade effects which tend to increase the tax base and decrease the opportunity costs of public consumption (marginal utility of private consumption falls). It follows that the retrenchment view that product market integration inevitably leads to a downward pressure on public sector activities does not get unconditional support in a standard setting. A particularly noteworthy finding is that a country with a large public sector (strong preferences for public consumption) may benefit more by integrating with a country with a smaller public sector (weak preferences for public consumption).

This allows companies to reduce complexity in the product portfolio, decrease engineering hours and improve the accuracy of the product specifications. This article proposes a framework to identify and compare products' similarities. The framework (1) identifies the most important product variables available in the Product Configuration System (PCS), (2) retrieves data of previously designed products in an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, (3) identifies a method to compare products based on the main products variables and (4) sets up an IT system (database) with data of the previously designed products to integrate with the PCS.

It presents a series of experiments conducted by some of Lewin’s former Ph.D. students from 1939 to 1946 at Harwood, a textile factory in Virginia, which contributed to early organisational action research. The article has three purposes. Firstly, it demonstrates how participation occurred to a certain degree in the Harwood organisation where the workers took part in group decisions based on management experimenting with participative management. It shows that the overall goal of the Harwood studies was to increase efficiency through changes in work group dynamics, and that this goal was determined by management and action researchers. The article concludes that participation was enacted as involvement, i.e. as a managerial tool. Organisational action research thus seems to have started as a form of organisational development studies (OD). Secondly, it shows that the research process was enacted primarily as co-operation between researchers. Workers and foremen participated by providing data and feedback, not as co-producers of knowledge in the research process. Thirdly, the article situates Lewin’s understanding of participation and change within a philosophy of science framework and characterises his concept of action research as applied, change-oriented social engineering, based on a natural science paradigm. The article argues that action research as applied research reduces the scope of participation. The article reflects critically on how to understand past experiments without translating the past into the present, and discusses a discrepancy between the radical contents of Lewin’s theories and the Harwood experiments. © 2017, Rainer Hampp Verlag.

Design/methodology/approach: By means of framing theory and a critical perspective on strategic discourse in hypermodal spaces, the study examines in detail the discursive strategies and framing processes employed by a non-profit organization that faces local and global contestation of its corporate operations. Findings: Through a critical discourse analysis of the organization’s 385 Facebook posts during two periods of time, the results not only show how the corporate perspective is strategically framed and legitimized, but also challenged and consequently adapted in this hypermodal issue sub-arena. In addition to legitimizing the organizational perspective by providing evidence-based facts and external expert views as reliable and neutral sources, and echoing supporters’ voices and actions as further endorsements, the organization also strategically manages the Facebook dialogue by delegitimizing counterarguments. Originality/value: This study contributes to the corporate communication field by revealing how framing can be materialized in specific discursive strategies aimed to legitimize and delegitimize. It shows how such strategies are interrelated in hypermodal clusters in ways that sustain the organizational discourse, and can evolve across time and within the same actor’s strategy.

Speed-up and efficiency are evaluated on a standard personal computer. Considerable time savings are achieved, allowing computations to take place in industry within reasonable computation time without access to any kind of supercomputers or clusters. The direct equation solver is parallelized for shared memory platforms by OpenMP instructions, and it can be directly implemented in existing finite element codes utilizing skyline matrix storage, no matter the physical dimensions of the problems dealt with. Only the call to the existing solver has to be substituted by a call to the proposed parallel solver.

A hybrid incubator means that a technology-based business incubators (TBIs) can implement various distinct value creation processes with the integration of the advantages of non-for-profit and for-profit TBIs at same time as Chinese government now requires government-sponsored non-for-profit TBIs to be profitable self-sustainability with less dependent on direct public subsidies, aiming to motivate these TBIs to provide higher quality services for their tenant new technology-based firms (NTBFs). Design/methodology/approach: This study conducts a single in-depth case-study of Tuspark Incubator (located in Tsinghua Science Park [TSP]) with categorical analysis. Findings: Three factors, i.e. incubation subdivision, intermediary platform and proactive approach, are found to be essential for a formerly government-sponsored TBI’s upgrading. Incubation subdivision enables Tuspark Incubator to create multiple incubation processes with incubator characteristic variables of both non-for-profit and for-profit incubators; with the establishment of intermediary platform, Tuspark Incubator provides specialized business support and high-quality networking from relevant specialized service organizations external to the incubator; more proactive approach with equity investment on incubating firms from Tuspark Incubator help to generate social welfare and financial profit at the same time. Practical implications: For the incubators’ managers, incubation subdivision enables TBIs to operate for-profit and non-for-profit processes at the same time and provides different specific needs; more open intermediary service platforms can leverage the full potential of the actors in innovation system and help TBIs to save resource when upgrading to hybrid incubators; proactive approaches nurture learning climate and entrepreneurship environment to enhance the successful rate on NTBFs inside incubators and provide main profit source for incubators. For policy makers, using proactive approaches including creating a good milieu for incubation on technology-based start-ups and the design of public guidance funds is increasingly crucial. Originality/value: This research is a pioneering study on the key factors and specific ways for the upgrade of government-sponsored non-for-profit TBIs in China to hybrid for-profit and non-for-profit incubators. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Categorical analysis; China; Hybrid incubator; Incubator",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032512860

To date, research has tended to focus on the outcome of the competition, i.e. on the creative solution. There is, however, a lack of understanding in such crowdsourcing environments of the creative process itself and the influence of social interaction on the platform during this process. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a series of qualitative interviews with participants from a major European crowdsourcing platform. The platform acts as an intermediary between companies and firms, and has launched more than 370 idea competitions. Findings: The results suggest that there are not only positive interactions going on between participants. Below the surface, there also appear destructive processes provoked by the fierce competition among the contestants for prizes and a position in the Top Innovator lists. Such destructive behavior includes bullying of successful contestants, excessive use of like-functions among befriended contestants, and mutual donation of prize money among in-group members. Practical implications: Negative social interaction among contestants of crowdsourcing communities can potentially threaten the platform provider’s business model. Managers of crowdsourcing platforms should engage in the development of strong social norms explicitly disapproving destructive behavior. Originality/value: This study is the first to investigate in detail the phase of idea generation on crowdsourcing platforms, and the nature and impact of social interactions among contestants. © 2017, © Rita Faullant, Guido Dolfus.","Crowdsourcing; Destructive processes; Idea competition; Motivation; Social interaction; Tournament",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032499642

Design/methodology/approach - Firm-level and macroeconomic (country competitiveness) data are combined to operationalize the constructs considered in the study. Structural equation modeling and cluster analysis are used to investigate the direct relationships between economic context, service provision and service return, and the negative association between the development of economic context and the service paradox. Findings - The analyses confirm the general assumption that service provision has a positive direct effect on service return. Economic context seems to have no direct effect on service return and, contrary to what was expected, it has a negative impact on the intensity of service provision. Thus, service provision fully mediates the negative impact of context on service return. Finally, the service paradox occurs more frequently in less-developed economic contexts, where the probability of a relatively low service return coupled with high service provision is significantly higher. Practical implications - The study identifies five key elements of economic context that have to be incorporated into the strategic decision-making process regarding product-related services offered by manufacturers. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the contextual research of services offered by manufacturers.

It is assumed that the personal engagement and the continuous involvement with a company’s products or services over a period of several weeks positively affect participants’ loyalty intentions toward the host companies. The research leads the authors to challenge this assumption. In addition to mere participation in crowdsourcing initiatives, the authors argue that perceptions of fairness will explain changes in customer relationship-related consequences such as loyalty, perceived innovativeness and product interest. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyzed a real-life crowdsourcing contest launched by a leading lighting manufacturer and investigated the impact of two fairness dimensions (distributive and procedural) on participants’ future behavioral and attitudinal intentions (n=121). The analysis was performed with SEM. Findings: The results suggest that fairness perceptions are significantly related to evoked product interest, perceived innovativeness and loyalty intentions. The analysis reveals that the influence of the fairness dimensions is asymmetric: while distributive fairness can be considered as a basic factor that must be fulfilled in order to avoid negative behavioral consequences, procedural fairness instead is an excitement factor that causes truly positive behavioral consequences. Research limitations/implications: The results are particularly relevant for companies launching a crowdsourcing competition under their own brand name, and for broadcasting platforms. For companies with no relations to end-users, these findings may not be as relevant. Practical implications: Organizers of crowdsourcing contests should be aware that such initiatives can be a double-edged sword. Fair Play is a must to gain the positive effects from crowdsourcing initiatives for both new product development and the customer relationship. For companies lacking the capabilities to manage crowdsourcing initiatives professionally it is advisable to rely on intermediary broadcasting platforms. Originality/value: The research is the first to investigate systematically the consequences of fairness perceptions in a real-life crowdsourcing idea contest. The authors demonstrate the asymmetric nature of fairness perceptions on three different outcome variables that are important for the customer relationship. © 2017, © Rita Faullant, Johann Fueller and Katja Hutter.","Co-creation; Crowdsourcing; Customer relationship; Distributive fairness; Procedural fairness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032189488

Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by Watson’s original paper and a new interview the authors made with him in 2017, this paper discusses the possible explanations for why management academics rarely advise on their own institutions and sets out an agenda for future research. Findings: The authors suggest a simple three-way categorization of the nine hypotheses identified by Watson (2000), grouping them by the themes of management knowledge, motivation of higher education institution (HEI) managers and incentives for academics to engage. This study proposes an integrated framework to illustrate how these three categories of hypotheses are connected and can jointly explain the observed phenomenon. The study provides theoretical underpinnings for the most promising hypotheses and suggests an agenda for future research, emphasizing the potential of such research to contribute to the learning organization field.

Based on data from a publicly available database of the Danish hospitality sector, the authors conduct hierarchical cluster analysis to identify different business models for the Danish gastronomic sector. Findings: Given the diversity of the gastronomic sector, there can be a multitude of alternative business models and characteristics, which may enable the sector to create value through, for example, product differentiation, market segmentation, and so on. The analysis revealed nine different clusters, which represent different business models in terms of value creation, segmentation, and resource utilization – highlighting either more closed or open business models. These business models offer a basis for considering the opportunities and barriers for business model innovation – for both startups and incumbent firms – within gastronomy and agri-food more generally. Originality/value: The gastronomic sector is diverse and heterogeneous with a multitude of possible alternative business models. This paper provides a basis for considering the key enablers of business model development in this sector. The integrative framework and empirical assessment provides a basis for further exploring business model innovation in the gastronomic sector in particular and the agri-food sector more generally. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Innovation","cluster analysis; differentiation; entrepreneurship; market",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031765070

The models developed would use the data (data-driven modeling) as early as possible at the modeling phase, which would lead to a better and more realistic representation of the problems being modeled. Design/methodology/approach – An essential feature of the presented approach is its declarativeness. The use of a declarative approach that additionally includes constraint satisfaction problems and provides an opportunity of fast and easy modeling of constrains different in type and character. Implementation of the proposed approach was performed with the use of an original hybrid method in which constraint logic programming (CLP) and mathematical programming (MP) are integrated and transformation of a model is used as a presolving technique. Findings – The proposed constraint-driven approach has proved to be extremely flexible and efficient. The findings obtained during part of experiments dedicated to efficiency were very interesting. The use of the constraint-driven approach has enabled finding a solution depending on the instance data up to 1,000 times faster than using the MP. Research limitations/implications – Due to the limited use of exact methods for NP-hard problems, the future study should be to integrate the CLP with environments other than the MP. It is also possible, e.g., with metaheuristics like genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, etc. Practical implications – There is a possibility of using the approach as a basis to build a decision support system for FSCM, simple integration with databases, enterprise resource planning systems, management information systems, etc. Originality/value – The new constraint-driven approach to FSCM has been proposed. The proposed approach is an extension of the hybrid approach. Also, a new decision-making model of distribution and logistics for the food supply chain is built. A presolving technique for this model has been presented. © Pawel Sitek, Jaroslaw Wikarek and Peter Nielsen.

Design/methodology/approach – The conditions for seamless (collision-free) synchronization of periodically executed local transport processes presented in this paper guarantee cyclic execution of supply processes, thereby preventing traffic flow congestion. Findings – Systems that satisfy this characteristic, cyclic deliveries executed along supply chains are given and what is sought is the number of vehicles needed to operate the local transport processes in order to ensure delivery from and to specific loading/unloading points on given dates. Determination of sufficient conditions guaranteeing the existence of feasible solutions that satisfy these constraints makes it possible to solve the considered class of problems online. Practical implications – The computer experiments reported in this paper show the possibilities of practical application of the proposed approach in the construction of decision support systems for food supply chain management. Originality/value – The aim of the present work is to develop a methodology for the synthesis of regularly structured supply networks that would ensure fixed cyclic execution of local transport processes.

Telecare is treated as a set of ideas regarding future processes in health and home care services, involving technological solutions, starting to change stakeholders' behaviour, work practices, and social roles. A system-centric framework is proposed to evaluate the interdependencies between telecare, the changing relationships, and the institutional context. Complexity and documentation requirements were identified as major hindrances to the improvement of efficiency and quality of health outcomes in Austria and Germany. On the contrary, in Denmark, governmental guidance supporting patient-centered approaches was found to be driving socially innovative solutions.

The literature has, however, not paid much systematic attention to generational differences in connection to moving from an imitation-based strategy towards an innovation-based strategy. This is especially the case concerning the entrepreneurial companies.

The new focus on responsible research and innovation (RRI) emphasises broader inclusion, increased dialogue, and a focus on societal challenges. The case of RESEARCH2015 in Denmark is one of the first European priority-setting processes to incorporate such criteria. This paper develops a theoretical model to explore how RESEARCH2015 contributes to mutual responsiveness among actors, a main objective of RRI. Studying mutual responsiveness means going beyond the often-stated focus on policy impact to look at the creation of trust, interdependence and mutual understanding among participants. The study finds that mutual responsiveness is an important precondition for priority-setting, but that the process's contribution to mutual responsiveness is limited, due to the limited attention to social impacts. Still, the case of RESEARHC2015 shows that mutual responsiveness is a relevant perspective for understanding social impacts in research priority-setting.

A total number of 155 pairs of employees and their immediate managers participated in this study. Employees rated their managers' behaviours and managers evaluated their subordinates' innovative behaviour. Both managers and employees answered to LMX measurement. Then, the agreements of employees' and managers' LMX rating were applied based on the results of within and between analysis (WABA). The obtained data were analysed through structural equation modelling-partial least square (SEM-PLS). The findings revealed the significance of mediating role of LMX in relationship between behaviour of recognising, taking risks for change and paternalistic with employees' innovative behaviour. Thus, this study has contributed to the leadership literature in addition to providing a clear vision for Malaysian managers to increase employees' innovative behaviour via improving exchange relationship.

Design/methodology/approach: The study proposes a model formed by a series of causal relations among value (i.e. functional, social, hedonic, altruistic values) and cost perceptions (i.e. price, effort, evaluation costs, performance and product safety), their trade-offs (i.e. overall customer value) and product evaluation outcomes (i.e. satisfaction, trust). Findings: Despite doubts about certain search (information), credence (safety) and experience (taste) attributes, perceptions about product quality, likeability and ethical image predominantly formulate customer value, indicating novel products’ potential to be evaluated positively by consumers. Research limitations/implications: The proposed model advances knowledge in the context of product innovation. Contrary to past research that focuses on consumer attitudes towards a manufacturing technology and individual technology-specific risks and benefits, the customer value approach refers to novel product-related consumer attitudes conceptualized as overall customer value; the latter results from product-related value-cost trade-offs, leading towards specific consumer–product evaluations. Practical implications: The customer value approach refers to the value from the adoption of a new product that underlies a relevant set of product attributes (e.g. quality, image, sustainability, price, convenience, taste, safety, etc.) Focusing on product attributes that generate gain – loss perceptions impactful on consumer – product evaluations is highly relevant for product managers concerned with new product development. Originality/value: The originality of this work lies in the successful contextualization and testing of an inclusive model that comprises both emotional and rational components, operational at the product level, to generate substantial insights on the widely unexplored interplay between consumer – perceived customer value and the generation of consumer – product evaluation outcomes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer attitudes; Customer value; Novel food products; Product evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030314608

This paper examines the concept of orchestration of work environment programs, based on an empirical analysis of recent Danish policy. Orchestration is a strategy where different stakeholders and activities are integrated into a unified program aimed at a specific target group. The analysis includes three policy cases, supplemented with two company case studies. The research shows a move toward a more governance type of regulation, which is not only emerging in network but also includes more explicitly orchestrated policy programs. The stakeholders participate in the network with different interests and the orchestration of work environment policies is therefore built on a platform of regulation, as it is especially important for employers and unions as key stakeholders in order to accept these shared policies.","Network governance; Occupational health and safety; Policy development; Policy orchestration; Public policy; Work environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029820780

This paper presents an exploratory study regarding the applicability of the framework to two small cohorts of CAMH nurses. This study was conducted in Tasmania, Australia and Northern Denmark. These settings were chosen due to the self-perceived knowledge gap surrounding the role and professional identity of these Australian and Danish CAMH nurses. Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory qualitative study within the social constructivist paradigm was undertaken. The method of data collection was two focus groups of CAMH nurses in Tasmania, Australia and Northern Denmark. The data were analysed using an adaptation of a six-phase thematic analysis process. Findings: The analysis of the data resulted in three themes: individual preparation and experience of CAMH nurses, knowledge transfer and nurses’ perceptions of their individual and team roles. The findings have contributed new knowledge of CAMH nursing.

Authenticity finds initial, shared significance in both religious traditions because of its critically important role in judgments concerning the legitimacy of source documents. It also stands in both traditions as an inspirational goal for human life. Design/methodology/approach: Particular issues of theological method for cross-cultural analysis are addressed by the use of insight-based critical realism as a transcultural foundation. Workplace parameters, the minimal enabling conditions for the possibility of authentic employment relations, are then identified and compared. The authors explore shared expectations for authenticity enabling conditions in terms of the direct and indirect employer: those national laws, systems and traditions that condition the functional range of authenticity that can be actualized within national or other work settings as experienced in the direct employment contract. Findings: The study found remarkable consistency in the minimal conditions identified by Roman Catholic and Sunni Islam social teachings for the prospects of authenticity in employment relations. These conditions addressed seven parameters: work and the concept of labor; private property; the nature of the employment contract; unions and collective bargaining; the treatment of wages; the relationship between managerial prerogative and employee participation; and the crucial role of the state as indirect employer. Practical implications: Specific minimal or threshold conditions of employment are described to ensure the prospect for authenticity in modern employment relations according to religious traditions. These include just cause employment conditions, unions and collective bargaining support, some form of management consultation/Shura, a living wage and a consultative exercise of managerial prerogative. Social implications: The study offers prescriptive and analytical aid to ensure assessment of circumstances fostering authenticity in employment relations. Originality/value: The method and findings are a first effort to clarify thought and aid mutual understanding for inter-faith employment circumstances based on Roman Catholic and Sunni Islam social teachings through a transcultural foundation in cognitional operations. The criterion variable specification of authenticity conditions offers a fully developed basis to support further empirical research in management spirituality, corporate social responsibility and enterprise sustainability. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Authenticity as a criterion variable in employment relations; Consultation/Shura in management practice; Management practice; Religion; Theology of the workplace",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029378514

Otherwise, credit ratings of SMEs mainly focus on financial information. Our research is limited by the number of interviewed banks and the concentration on creditworthiness assessments of SMEs.

The empirical focus is wages and working hours in three selected sectors within private services in the Danish labour market – industrial cleaning, retail, hotels and restaurants – and their agreement-based regulation of working time and wages. Theoretically, this analysis is inspired by the concept of living hours, which addresses the interaction between working hours and living wages, but adds a new layer to the concept in that the authors also consider the importance of working time regulations for securing a living wage. Design/methodology/approach: The paper builds on desk research of collective agreements and analysis of monthly administrative register data on wages and working hours of Danish employees from the period 2008-2014. Findings: This analysis shows that the de facto hourly wages have increased since the global financial crisis in all three sectors. This is in accordance with increasing minimum wage levels in the sector-level agreements. The majority of workers in all three sectors work part-time. Marginal part-timers – 15 hours or less per week – make up the largest group of workers. The de facto hourly wage for part-timers, including marginal part-timers, is relatively close to the sector average. However, the yearly job-related income is much lower for part-time than for full-time workers and much lower than the poverty threshold. Whereas the collective agreement in industrial cleaning includes a minimum floor of 15 weekly working hours – this is not the case in retail, hotels and restaurants. This creates a loophole in the latter two sectors that can be exploited by employers to gain wage flexibility through part-time work. Originality/value: The living wage literature usually focusses on hourly wages (including minimum wages via collective agreements or legislation). This analysis demonstrates that studies of low-wage work must include the number of working hours and working time regulations, as this aspect can have a dramatic influence on absolute wages – even in cases of hourly wages at relatively high levels. Part-time work and especially marginal part-time work can be associated with very low yearly income levels – even in cases like Denmark – if regulations do not include minimum working time floors. The authors suggest that future studies include the perspective of living hours to draw attention to the effect of low number of weekly hours on absolute income levels. © 2017, ©Anna Ilsøe, Trine Pernille Larsen and Jonas Felbo-Kolding.","Living hours; Low-wage workers; Private services; The Danish IR-model; Working time regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028950868

Secondly, there is a stronger organisational separation between the organisation of elite sports and the organisation of ‘Sport for All’. Thirdly, Denmark has a number of semi-governmental institutions for sports, which in other countries are either included as part of the national organisation of sport or as part of the state department responsible for sport. Fourthly, the Danish sport policy is particularly decentralised. Fifthly, there are essentially two separate support systems, one at the local level and one at the state level.

But not all innovation projects lead to commercialisation; some are abandoned, and these abandoned innovation projects can be classified as a waste of resources. Therefore, this paper studies the influence of different external sources and a firm’s decision to abandon an innovation project. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broader understanding of abandoned projects. Design/methodology/approach: The data applied are quantitative data and the empirical background is the Danish Innovation Survey 2009. The sample consists of Danish manufacturing firms with ten employees or more (n=840). The results are based on logistic regression analysis. Findings: Results reveal that firms should consider that the involvement of customers can lead them to abandon innovation projects. However, if firms combine customers with universities, it will decrease the likelihood of innovation projects being abandoned. A more in-depth analysis shows that the involvement of customers from “Europe” (countries in Europe excluding Denmark) and the “US” leads to innovation projects being abandoned while customers from “other countries” (the rest of the world, including China and India) have the opposite effect. Originality/value: The contribution is to the limited literature on abandoned innovation projects by suggesting that the type of external sources is a significant factor in firms’ decisions to abandon innovation projects. The paper identifies that the involvement of certain external sources leads firms to decide to abandon innovation projects, and that the country of origin of the external sources is an important criterion to consider in relation to a firm’s decision to abandon innovation projects. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abandoned innovation projects; Country of origin; External knowledge sources; Logistic regression analysis; Open innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028645252

A place many travelers pass through is the airport. Airports are places where travelers’ performances are restricted in many ways and waiting is a key element of the airport experience. This paper contributes with knowledge on what airport terminals “are”, not as designs or material objects but as places enacted by travelers. In doing so, the paper aims to emphasize on both how travelers “see” airports and how they use them. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses different qualitative methods and notions of time and waiting. Sources of data are small-scale netnography, focus group interviews, observations done at airports and qualitative interviews. Findings: The study shows that airport terminals are heterogeneously enacted environments that are heavily inscribed with the mundane act of waiting and travelers use a series of different strategies to “use”, “spend” and “kill” time. Furthermore, whereas more affluent travelers spend waiting time using airports’ commercial offerings (shopping, restaurants, bars, etc.), less affluent travelers do not have the same options. Research limitations/implications: The research points to airport terminals as not only “places of movement and mobility” but also “places of waiting” inscribed with boredom and travelers actively fight boredom by spending, using and killing time in a variety of ways. Furthermore, the study points to significant differences between affluent travelers and other travelers and differences between people travelling alone and in groups. Therefore, a call is made for research focusing on less affluent travelers, people traveling in groups and on waiting and waiting time. Practical implications: The study suggests that airports are more than consumerscapes and places of movement, hereby questioning the current focus on commercial revenues. Social implications: The study points to airport space as space “inhabited” not only by travelers willingly taking on the roles as consumers but also by travelers that kill, spend and use waiting time in other ways, hereby questioning the idea that airports are places for the “elite”. Originality/value: Travelers associate airports with boredom and inscribe them with waiting. However, travelers “fight” boredom and waiting with performances and acts designed to use, spend, pass and “kill” time. Hereby, travelers not only accept but also construct the seemingly mundane act of waiting as restricted, negotiated and confined, but nevertheless meaningful performances. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airports; Boredom; Experiencescapes; Qualitative research; Time; Tourist experiences","airport; knowledge based system; qualitative analysis; questionnaire survey; research work; shopping activity; tourist behavior; travel behavior; travel time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028634157

However, on several occasions the use by public authorities of information and communication technology (ICT) has caused unlawful administration due to deficient and faulty programming. In the 1990s and 2000s, the implementation of e-government mainly influenced procedural matters, and thus had little influence on the material decisions, but - from a legal point of view - the consequences of the rash transition of the former paper-based Danish public administration have changed in recent years. By 2014, automated decisionmaking affected the very content of a large number of decisions directed at citizens, causing downright unlawful administration and violating the very core of the rule of law. Aware of the potential risks, the influential Danish Parliamentary Ombudsman has been investigating the public authorities' use of ICT since the beginning of the 1990s. Due to the many instances of unlawful administration caused by inadequate design of ICT, it has been necessary for the institution to develop new principles of administrative law regulating the use of ICT in the public sector. The aim of this paper is to examine these new principles, through an examination of selected opinions of the Ombudsman. Ultimately, two are presented: Administrative law by design and good administration impact assessment. The principle of administrative law by design requires public authorities to apply a value-based approach to the development and use of ICT in the public sector. Relevant legislation and unwritten principles of public administrative law should be embedded into the design of ICT used by public authorities. The requirement for a good administration impact assessment was developed as late as 2014. A good administration impact assessment is a procedure-mapping of relevant legislation and principles of administrative law as part of the development of ICT, if the technology in question is to be used by public authorities. These new principles of administrative law are developed and based on one very simple premise: Public authorities are responsible for developing e-government in compliance with relevant regulation and unwritten principles of administrative law. © The Authors, 2017.","Administrative law; Administrative law by design; Digitalisation; E-government; Rule of law; The Danish Ombudsman","Government data processing; Laws and legislation; Public risks; Administrative law; Digitalisation; E-governments; Rule of law; The Danish Ombudsman; Public administration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028461400

We coin this type of secondary design deep secondary design. In this paper, we investigate how to enable deep secondary design by analyzing two cases where secondary designers fundamentally change functionality, content and technology complexity level. The first case redesigns a decision model for agile development in an insurance company; the second creates a contingency model for choosing project management tools and techniques in a hospital. Our analysis of the two cases leads to the identification of four principles of design implementation that primary designers can apply to enable secondary design and four corresponding design implementation principles that secondary designers themselves need to apply. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Case study; Design theory; Principles; Secondary design","Information systems; Insurance; Project management; Complexity levels; Contingency models; Design implementation; Design theory; Insurance companies; Principles; Principles of design; Project management tools; Social networking (online)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028348316

They only consider governance in the organization environment and rarely look beyond their immediate stakeholders. In many corporations, the immediate stakeholders are even considered to be the investors and only those regardless of the apparency of other close stakeholders such as workers, customers, suppliers, authorities, and interest groups or non-governmental organizations. Even corporations with such narrow views and organizations with a broader stakeholder view are relatively unrealistic and are inappropriate in the modern global world, which we inhabit.Organizations of any form and size need to recognize both the need to consider radical changes in the modern global environment and the opportunities and possibilities presented by the current environment. Therefore, this chapter takes a broad approach and considers governance requirements in the modern world seen from a global perspective for all forms of organization.With global perspective, organizational governance is, here, called New Governance, and it includes the idea, that even the smallest decision can have a dramatic social, economic, or geopolitical impact in other parts of the world. The idea of New Governance is to put on the global lenses when making decisions to consider the potential effect - positive as well as negative - on the local as well as the global perspective, even on the unknown future and on future generations to come. Some may call this sustainable governance, but in this chapter, it is embedded in the New Governance as a concept, which can be nothing else but sustainable in its core idea. The future requirements for New Governance in any kind of organization are discussed, as the relationship between organizations and its global and future stakeholders, and how they form these requirements.

However, the academic underpinning is still poor, and city branding needs a more critical conceptualization, as well as more complex management systems. This paper the use of a “one size fits all” city brand, which is still common practice in many places. The paper proposes that city branding involves much more complexity than is commonly thought and outlines a strategy that enables urban policy-makers, marketing researchers and (place) marketers alike to better deal with city branding. Design/methodology/approach: The authors integrate insights from literature on place branding, brand architecture and customer-focused marketing. Findings: The article argues that place brands (in general and communicated place brands in particular) are by definition very complex, due to their different target groups, diverse place offerings and various associations place customers could have. Thus, an advanced brand management including target group-specific sub-brands is needed. Practical implications: The model will be helpful for place brand managers dealing with a diverse target audience, and is likely to improve the target group-specific communication.

The development process was successful, with productivity increasing by 20% within 1 year. We found that productivity improvements and positive work environment changes were made possible by developing responsible autonomy through an employee-driven innovation process that led to a focus on quality and productivity throughout the organization. We also found that the development of responsible autonomy prevents defensive routines from disrupting the learning and development processes in the organization.

I discuss central tenets from leading scholars in relation to group norms, contextualized working tasks, and conflicts among groups. Although treated differently, the phenomena of the small group, group dynamics, resistance to change, and process consultation are throughgoing. These phenomena link the discipline together into a mutually discordant, but relatively consistent discipline. While the early currents focused on interpersonal process based on dialogue for the sake of satisfaction and efficiency, the latter sees movement as a goal in itself. The analysis exposes a decrease over time of analytical interest in group norms, contextualized tasks, and avoidance of conflict.

The purchase data are matched with information about labelling status. Other product and purchase characteristics, such as store-type and organic, are controlled for. Findings: Households with children tend to have a lower probability of purchasing labelled products compared to other household types, while urbanity increases the probability. This holds both across countries and across products. In Denmark education is positively correlated with label purchase, while in the Netherlands it is income. Generally, the observable characteristics of the consumers are poor in explaining the probability of purchasing labelled products which suggests that other aspects as the underlying attitudes and general health awareness may be of greater importance in identifying these consumers.

Based on a case of Danish manufacturing SMEs that developed their local ecosystem in an innovative automation project, we find key drivers and challenges that these companies encountered while creating and capturing value both for them and the ecosystem at large. While the value creation process is enabled by common goals and financial support, companies need to balance their core activities with their commitment to the joint initiative. Moreover, ecosystem development is centrally dependent on the value-capture process, which also takes place at the inter-organisational level. Such open innovation process implies a purposive management of knowledge flows at the level of the innovation ecosystem that fits a multi-layered structure of the business model.

Second, to highlight issues of project management, specially the risk management with its economic, social and political domains at the construction site and in France and America. Design/methodology/approach: The case study research method of qualitative research has been adopted when comparing two mega projects executed in different time and space. For the Panama Canal project documentation investigation was performed. However, a semi-structured interview data collection method was adopted for the Palm Diera Island project. A comparative study of two projects helps in deeper understanding of cross-project management dimensions. Findings: The research reveals that the French team failed to complete the Panama Canal construction project due to inadequate planning, inappropriate design, lack of risk management, health and safety of the staff and non-availability of finances. However, the Americans successfully completed construction of the canal within budget and time and this was due to the support of change in the purpose of the canal construction adding to achieve its commercial objectives and at the same time strengthen its naval presence. American took its construction as a national objective than the individual enterprise as executed by the French team. Research limitations/implications: Data collection for the Panama Canal was limited to only historical data available from the literature as documentary investigation. The researchers visited the canal to get in-depth understanding of the construction practices and the scale of construction. However, for the Palm Diera project, data collection was limited to three key personnel interviews. Practical implications: The Americans were successful in completing the canal due to the US Government control on management and finances of the canal construction and lessons learned during the French construction period. The paper serves as a benchmark for project management dimension in two different regions in different times. The paper bears economic implications for the construction of the mega projects both in South America and the Middle East. Cost overrun construction of the Panama Canal during the French period influenced political spectrum in France resulting into the defeat of the government. During the American period of construction first time out of country visit by the sitting president of the USA reflects its economic and social importance. The valley of death was converted into the valley comfort during the American period resulting into social welfare of the workers. Completion of the canal by the Americans helped them secure operations of the Panama Canal for the next 100 years, contributing to its economic and naval strength. Social implications: The paper reveals that safety and social implications for the work place in two different regions and at two different times. The impact of safe and improved working conditions at Palm Diera Island resulted into no injury or loss of life, however, during the Panama Canal construction more than 30,000 workers died affecting not only families of the respective workers but their nations as well. The impacts of both the projects on the society were also significant. The public opinion against the construction of the canal during the French period of construction was so significant that they had to abandon their construction equipment at the site. On the contrary, completion of construction of the Panama Canal during the French period helped secured political mileage for President Roosevelt and his party.

Design/methodology/approach: On the basis of a strong process view as the orienting paradigm, the authors demonstrate the need for the ESM by discussing the shortcomings of two specific spiral types in the organizational literature – the knowledge creation spiral and the efficacy spiral. Findings: A review of each spiral type through the lens of nonlinear assumptions reveals the treatment to date of organizational spirals as uni-directional and insufficient for understanding organizations. The authors propose that managers must undertake a paradigm shift in order to gain a greater awareness of both the environment in which they operate, as well as their process actions. To facilitate this shift, the ESM depicts choice points, chosen and rejected trajectories, and upward and downward environmental drafts, as well as a multi-dimensional environment, as a way of re-conceptualizing approaches to space, time, and change in organization studies. Originality/value: The authors propose that the model provides a way for scholars to enhance the study of organizations by understanding that organizations exist in a more dynamic environment than previously studied; recognizing that the organization has a wider range of choices available, and acknowledging the long-lasting ramifications of both choices made and choices discarded; and obtaining a more comprehensive look at the way the organization moves through space and time at any given moment.

Connectivity, risk, and performance have remained consistent concerns across the various market-based and/or network-based alternatives to bureaucracy found in New Public Management (NPM) and post-NPM reforms. In contrast to the image of a flexible compromise between bureaucracy, markets, and networks prevailing in current debate, the article suggests that the long-standing tension between technocracy and bureaucracy are of vital importance to the administrations of advanced liberal democracies. Indeed, the partial compromise between technocracy and bureaucracy reached in the earlier creation of a ""techno-bureaucracy"" designed for planning and social engineering has been largely supplanted by a more adversarial stance towards bureaucracy in late modern technocracy due to the requirements of connectivity, risk, and performance. © The Author 2016.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026898104

Design/methodology/approach - Representatives of two Finnish companies and their Chinese and Finnish suppliers were interviewed to collect qualitative data from 23 managers. Findings - The Chinese managers emphasized relationship-specific, personalized trustworthiness. They highlighted personalized communication and benevolence, which manifested in respect and reciprocity, rooted in the Chinese notion of ""guanxi"" as personal ties. In contrast, the Finnish managers' view of trustworthiness was more associated with depersonalized organizational attributes. They emphasized the dimension of integrity, especially promise-keeping. In addition, tentative signs of trust ambivalence, as a balance between trust- and distrust-related factors, were identified for both the Chinese and the Finns. Research limitations/implications - Due to the exploratory nature of this study the validity of the findings is limited to these data and context. Future studies could explore other national contexts as well as the effects of industry, market position, and position in the supply chain. Practical implications - The findings of this study bring a valuable understanding of the potential pitfalls and unique challenges in cross-border inter-firm transactions. These can enhance inter-firm trust building in a cross-cultural context. Originality/value - This study enriches the view of trust as a holistic process of simultaneous evaluation of both trustworthiness and distrustworthiness. In this process, trust ambivalence could serve as the intermediate construct between trust and distrust. These two contrary yet complementary opposites constitute a duality to be managed from the perspective of yin-yang balancing. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Buyer-supplier relationships; Cross-cultural; Distrustworthiness; Trust ambivalence; Trustworthiness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026857990

Effectuation is not only subjectified in entrepreneurship education, but has also become conceptualized as a method in the learning process. The purpose of this paper is to explore how students, who are novice entrepreneurs, react to working effectually and which barriers they face when applying effectual decision-making logics in a university course. Design/methodology/approach: A student-centered process course in entrepreneurship with 142 students provides a unique opportunity to explore the phenomena. Participant/teacher observations, written and oral work from the students and finally formal and informal written evaluations of the course by the students provide comprehensive data. Findings: The authors find that students experience three barriers to using effectuation. These are: noviceness, regarding the project as a “school project,” perceived lack of legitimacy of both the instructors and the process. Originality/value: The contribution of this study is threefold: first, to contribute to the understanding of the applicability of effectuation for novice entrepreneurs in the classroom; second, to articulate the factors that hinder entrepreneurial learning when effectuation is used in a process course; and third, to shed light on the importance of contextual factors for individual learning. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship education; Novice entrepreneur; Undergraduates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026475470

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the reflections, considerations, and experiences of such employees regarding the spaces of possibility open to them in which to act in accordance with this new role. Design/methodology/approach: Two ethnographic studies were carried out in drug and alcohol treatment services and in city and business development in the Danish welfare system. Findings: Although the areas of investigation are not related in their daily practices, the authors trace similar responses to the demands made of their respective employees as their role shifts from that of professional experts to include more entrepreneurial aspects. The authors observe that employees are often eager to align new demands and practices, and the authors identify various challenges in respect of the structural public set-up of these services, which often leaves the employees to operate in what could be described as a “twilight zone” between the public and the private. Originality/value: While scholars often have accounted for situations where such pluralistic roles create conflict, the authors also answer calls to capture moments of synergy where tensions of role paradox are constructively exploited. In this process of ongoing production, images of hierarchy and bureaucracy, rather than merely casting shadows over more bottom-up process of entrepreneurship, are actively used, alongside images of entrepreneurship, in the mutual construction of different roles and the constantly shifting relationality between them, conflicting or synergetic. The definitions and interpretations of the role of the public sector employee are not entirely fixed, but rather subject to ongoing (re)construction in the daily workings of public organizations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bureaucracy; Entrepreneurship; Expertice; Public vs private; Reform; Role paradoxes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025830437

The networking differs between men and women; notably, men are more often networking for advice in the public sphere and women are more often networking for advice in the private sphere. The purpose of this study is to account for how such gendering of entrepreneurs’ networks of advisors differs between societies and cultures. Design/methodology/approach: Based on survey data from the Global Entrepreneurships Monitor, a sample of 16,365 entrepreneurs is used to compare the gendering of entrepreneurs’ networks in China and five countries largely located around the Persian Gulf, namely Yemen, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Findings: Analyses show that female entrepreneurs tend to have slightly larger private sphere networks than male entrepreneurs. The differences between male and female entrepreneurs’ networking in the public sphere are considerably larger. Societal differences in the relative prominence of networking in the public and private spheres, and the gendering hereof, correspond well to cultural and socio-economic societal differences. In particular, the authors found marked differences among the religiously conservative and politically autocratic Gulf states. Research limitations/implications: As a main limitation to this study, the data disclose only the gender of the entrepreneur, but not the gender of each advisor in the network around the entrepreneur. Thus, the authors cannot tell the extent to which men and women interact with each other. This limitation along with the findings of this study point to a need for further research on the extent to which genders are structurally mixed or separated as entrepreneurs network for advice in the public sphere. In addition, the large migrant populations in some Arab states raise questions of the ethnicity of entrepreneurs and advisors. Originality/value: Results from this study create novel and nuanced understandings about the differences in the gendering of entrepreneurs’ networking in China and countries around Persian Gulf. Such understandings provide valuable input to the knowledge of how to better use the entrepreneurial potential from both men and women in different cultures. The sample is fairly representative of entrepreneur populations, and the results can be generalized to these countries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Arabian gulf; China; Entrepreneurs; Gender; Iran; Networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025820336

Descriptions of changes to the practice of social work which was observed empirically serve as a starting point for experimenting with how social scientists, though often exploring transformative study objects, can remain focused on describing the object, under study. Design/methodology/approach: The study was done through circa one year of fieldwork conducted with participant observation in two Danish municipal units offering services to socially marginalized people and interviews with social workers and employees in drug/alcohol treatment and psychiatric units. Findings: The object of study within social sciences, though changing, is able to be described. Through the theories of “Social Navigation” (Vigh) and “Strategy and Tactics” (de Certeau), the practice of social work can be described as one concrete bounded practice but one which is performed within a transformative/changeable environment that are capable of influencing it. In this case, the experience of a changeable seascape might serve as a metaphor for how study objects change within an environment of change; how they can be viewed as “motion within motion” (Vigh). Originality/value: Even though fields such as anthropology and organizational studies seem to rid themselves from their objects of study (culture and organization, respectively) and dissociate themselves from descriptions thereof these objects might still be of value to us. Even though the objects of study in postmodern anthropology and organizational studies are defined as unbounded, anti-essential, ephemeral, ever-changing non-objects, this might not be the entire picture. Despite their ever-changing shape, we might still be able to study and describe them if we take their changeable form and environment into account. © 2017, © Louise Christensen.","Anthropology; Change; Organizational studies; Social marginalization; Social work; Welfare state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025818853

The term “supplier-driven innovation” is coined in contrast to the current hype on user-driven innovation; this paper aims to discuss the wicked problems for suppliers to actively engage in customers’ innovations. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study of eight Danish suppliers. Findings: The wicked problem of supplier-driven innovation is generated by two intertwined constraints: the ability to engage customers in the co-creation of attractive offers and the ability to include technological knowledge and capabilities residing in the upstream network of suppliers. Research limitations/implications: This research combines an industrial network approach with perspectives generated through design management literature aiming to develop an innovative space for co-creation across diverse organizational, technological and managerial domains in the global production system. Practical implications: To participate in supplier-driven innovation, partners need to co-create an innovative space for joint development. Originality/value: Co-creation enriches the understanding of the diversity of forms of interaction, ranging from information and knowledge exchange and mutual adaptation processes to experimentation with processes of co-creation. Through a complementary view on how suppliers co-create innovative spaces of action in the upstream spaces of technical knowledge as well as the downstream spaces of preferential needs, the research contributes insights about the characteristics of the wicked problems that suppliers need to handle in bridging and expanding these spaces for innovative actions. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Co-creation; Innovation spaces; Self- and collective interests; Supplier-driven innovation; Wicked problems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025106419

Similar to the situation in Eastern Europe, this type of ownership was quite widespread in China, particularly during the 1990s. Based on the existing literature and available statistical data, the purpose of this paper is to identify drivers of, and barriers to, the development of employee ownership in China. Design/methodology/approach: The scattered evidence from the literature and official statistical sources are collected and structured in a systematic analysis where the drivers and barriers for employee ownership in the transition process from plan to market are identified at three levels: society, the company and the individual. Findings: Employee ownership developed as a transitory stage between state and private ownership; employees acquired ownership stakes as part of the privatisation of small- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises as well as collectively owned enterprises. However, in most cases the dynamics of ownership resulted in dominant ownership by managers. This trend became more noticeable at later stages of the privatisation process. Research limitations/implications: The paper shows how policies and institutional settings at the society level are determining for the development of employee ownership. Originality/value: The contribution of the paper is to give a general and systematic analysis of the development of employee ownership in China both based on a comprehensive literature review and by utilising existing statistical sources. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Corporate governance; Employee ownership; Privatization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024876108

Increasing functional specialization, multinational diversity and business acquisitions challenged the core values and called for more formal enforcement. Core values executed through investment in positive economic externalities enhanced the reputation and facilitated sustainable collaborative solutions. Design/methodology/approach: This single-case study collects evidence from experienced multinational executives for practitioner-based theory building. The information is interpreted against prevailing theory to gain deeper insights for practice. Observed phenomena are discussed in various managerial audiences and cross-checked against documents, news articles, books and involved external stakeholders. The case material and executive narratives are further assessed from storytelling and retrospective sense-making perspectives. Findings: The study illustrates how core values were enforced through concrete executive decisions driving corporate reputation and good stakeholder relationships. It provides evidence of positive outcomes as future conflicts are reduced while levering the reputation to deal more effectively with emergent risks. The core values influenced corporate responsible behavior and supported long-term adaptability, but increasing diversification and global expansion also diluted those values. Originality/value: Corporate responsible behavior is a significant challenge in large organizations with many and diverse multinational stakeholders. Ethical conduct derives from executive morality, but the role of leaders as instigators of responsible behavior has not been studied in the context of multinational enterprise. Hence, this article fills a need for more granular longitudinal studies of complex internationalizing organizations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Economic externalities; Leadership values; Multinational diversity; Organizational culture; Stakeholder theory; Values-based management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024831549

Design/methodology/approach: The paper investigates a strategic sourcing and procurement process in a large public organisation in Denmark based on participating in internal meetings, a workshop, document studies and interviews. The process is compared to a new ISO standard with guidance on strategic sourcing and development of FM agreements. Findings: A problem in the new ISO standard is that it is based on sequential model starting with detailing the demand and needs before investigating sourcing option. The case shows that the way needs are specified are depending on the chosen sourcing models. Based on a thorough analysis, the organisation decided to change the sourcing strategy with insourcing the most critical building-related activities and changing the procurement strategy from one integrated FM contract to three bundled and seven single-service contracts. The concept of right-sourcing is discussed. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on a study of one public organisation, which limits the possibility to generalise the results. However, it provides detailed insights into the strategic sourcing process in FM, which can give inspiration for practitioners and further research. Originality/value: The paper throws light on a strategic sourcing process which is rarely available in public because of confidentiality considerations, and it provides the first evaluation of the new ISO standard from 2016. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Benefits and Financial Results; New business or process or operations models; Process design; Qualitative; Supplier or partner selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024502564

Design/methodology/approach: Building on existing notions of responsibility proposed in the literature, the paper develops a theoretical account of “networks of responsibility” which capture the interlinked nature of responsibility relationships. The usefulness of the approach is evaluated by exploring two cases of R&I in industry deploying a qualitative research approach that involves interviewing and document analysis. For this, a multinational company from Germany was involved, as well as a small- and medium-sized company from Denmark. Findings: The study surfaced 68 responsibility relationships involving a range of different objects, subjects, authorities and norms. By describing overlaps in objects, subjects and other aspects across relationships, the theoretical model proved adequate in untangling and displaying interrelatedness of responsibilities. Furthermore, the analysis surfaced characteristics of responsible research and innovation (RRI) that are already in place in the R&I processes of two innovative companies, such as anticipation, foresight and stakeholder engagement. Not all aspects of responsibility outlined in the theoretical model could be extracted from the interview data for every responsibility relationship, pointing to the need for further research. Practical implications: The paper is practically relevant because it supports policy development on an organisational, as well as societal level. Moreover, the networks of responsibility model offer a fine-grained assessment of responsibilities in R&I practice by mapping existing responsibilities which supports translating RRI principles into everyday organisational practices. Social implications: RRI sets an ambitious agenda to ensure a more social and ethical R&I. Much work is still needed to bridge the gap between these theoretical and political aspirations and daily R&I practice, especially in non-academic contexts such as industry. By offering a way to understand and untangle the complexity of responsibility relationships, the networks of responsibility model seem to offer a promising approach that can support this endeavour. Originality/value: The paper offers a novel theoretical approach to understanding and analysing responsibility allocations in R&I in industry. It demonstrates the reliability of this theoretical position empirically. It is practically important because it supports policy development on an organisational as well as societal level. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Notion of responsibility; Research and innovation; Responsible research and innovation (RRI); Social desirability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024120896

The authors consider patents, industrial designs (i.e. design patents in the USA), trademarks, and copyrights. Design/methodology/approach: The relationships between open innovation, IPRs, and profitability are tested with random-effects panel regressions on data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey for 2,873 firms spanning the years 2008-2013. Findings: A key result is that SMEs do not benefit from open innovation or from patenting in the same way as larger firms. Furthermore, the results show that SMEs profit in different ways from IPR, depending on their size and the corresponding IPR. Research limitations/implications: The different impact of IPRs on the efficiency of open innovation in firms of varying sizes highlights the importance of further investigation into IP strategies and into open innovation in SMEs. Practical implications: Industrial designs are currently the most efficient IPR for SMEs to protect their intellectual property in open innovation collaborations. Depending on the company size, the use of different IPRs is recommended. Moreover, firms should seek to increase the efficiency of open innovation and the use of IPRs. Social implications: The high impact of SMEs on employment highlights the importance of fomenting efficient innovation processes in such firms.

The purpose of the paper is to elaborate on whether OR, such as related to internationalization strategies, by/in family businesses differs from OR by other companies or individuals, and if yes, to what extent. Design/methodology/approach: Taking a conceptual perspective, the authors combine OR and family business knowledge to develop propositions on how family entrepreneurs recognize opportunities. Findings: The authors develop three propositions about OR in entrepreneurial families. Specifically, they suggest that storytelling strengthens OR in family businesses and helps to hold on to tacit opportunities. They also address their special human capital resources. These advantages together with their long-term orientation lead to the proposition that family businesses are more likely to recognize opportunities than non-family businesses. Research limitations/implications: These findings contribute to an increased understanding of the role of OR in family business research and offer an operational base for future quantitative and qualitative studies. Practical implications: The insights in this paper are valuable for practitioners and policymakers as well. Practitioners will get feedback on their own family business management by reflecting on the findings reported and will be able to put the theses into a wider context.

Design/methodology/approach: A web-based e-mail survey was undertaken in the Sardinian accommodation sector in 2012. The sample included 224 accommodation firms and analyses were performed using ordered logit regressions. Findings: The results suggest no differential impact of EO on sales and profit depending on the attractiveness of the location in which the accommodation firm operates. Both EO and destination attractiveness were found to exert independent positive effects on firm performance. Furthermore, EO was found to have a larger effect on firm performance than destination attractiveness. Research limitations/implications: The study mainly considered hotels and camping accommodations in Sardinia. Additional investigations across accommodation types and geographic contexts are needed. Practical implications: The findings suggest that accommodation firms should focus on implementing entrepreneurial activities and not only, as frequently happens, concentrate on selecting attractive destinations in which to conduct their business. Moreover, the findings also suggest that accommodation firms that are located in less attractive areas may produce good performance if they are managed with an EO. Finally, training programs should be developed to improve the entrepreneurial abilities of accommodation managers. Originality/value: The specific topics of this paper have been understudied.

The research ambition of the paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the managerial decision-making made by family business managers, in this case farmers, and how these decisions may impact financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a case study including farmers, agricultural consultants and bankers. The analysis uses pragmatic constructivism to analyse the economic reality of the farmers included and the business topos among Danish farmers. Findings: The main finding of the paper is that the dominating non-financial performance management techniques and a historically based strong emotional emphasis on size and production volume as the main success criteria for being a good farmer have led to a neglect of economic rationality. In addition, this practice has made the farmers blind to alternative possibilities for taking advantage of the resources available. The result has been an un-economic utopian reality. Originality/value: The paper shows how the use of non-financial performance measures can lead to prolonging of a certain reality perception that may not be economically sustainable. Small family businesses such as family farms are likely to be more exposed to such risk because such businesses are run by a set of values that include more objectives that are more dominating than the profit objective. The paper concludes that family business managers must be open towards inputs from the society around the business, because family businesses may have a tendency tocreate their own reality thatat some point may comein conflict with society of which the family business has to co-exist within. © Emerald Publishing Limited 1176-6093.","Economic reality construction; Familiy farm holding; Non-financial performance measures; Pragmatic constructivism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021753432

However, many controversial policy problems regarding science and technology, such as agricultural biotechnology, are often characterised by low value consensus and high level of complexity. In these circumstances various policy actors legitimate their policy preferences using science. In this article, we challenge the linear model of science and policy and argue that the stakeholder model of science in policy is more appropriate for governance of controversial policy problems regarding science and technology. We build our argument on available literature and empirical data from interviews and two online surveys. We choose agricultural biotechnology as the case study to illustrate scientists' perception about their role in policy-making. Our study illustrates that agricultural biotechnology scientists sympathise with the stakeholder model of science and policy. However, there is a gap between perceived ideal role for scientists in policy-making and the role, which these scientists actually take. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Agricultural biotechnology; Policy-making; Regulations; Scientists","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biotechnology; Agricultural biotechnology; Linear modeling; Model of science; Policy decisions; Policy making; Regulations; Science and Technology; Scientists; Decision making; agricultural technology; attitudinal survey; biotechnology; decision analysis; governance approach; perception; policy making; regulatory approach; science and technology; stakeholder; traditional agriculture; biotechnology; case report; human; interview; management; perception; scientist; statistical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021160862

The national support scheme idea was to generate consumer confidence in organic food to develop a bigger market for such food. The chapter shows the relationships between conventional and organic food stakeholders can be characterised by elements of competition and cooperation and have been instrumental in shaping each other. The relative success of organic food has brought competition from ‘green’ concepts developed by conventional food companies. The knowledge system has played an important role in the development of organic food production and consumption. The analyses of organic agriculture and food have shown how governmental regulation has shaped the concept of organic agriculture.

VCB as a means to facilitate value realisation processes is gaining importance in service research and practice. Encouraging such enactments can be challenging, but can also offer competitive advantages. Design/methodology/approach: We empirically investigate a conceptual model by converging three contemporary concepts of co-creation research – embeddedness, VCB and value-in-context – and examining the interdependencies between them. Data were collected in an online forum of a leading international weight-management firm. Findings: Results suggest that customers’ embeddedness is a key antecedent of customers’ VCB in a service system. The three embeddedness dimensions – structural, relational and cultural – have a differential impact on customers’ VCB. Furthermore, findings illustrate that customers’ VCB has a significant impact on their object-oriented, self-oriented and brand-oriented social value-in-context outcomes. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes by empirically investigating and validating antecedents and consequences of VCB in a service system. In doing so, the study highlights the significance of the nature of customer’s social constellations to develop contexts where value outcomes are actualised. Understanding the factors that shape VCB offers insights for firms to recognise how and where value propositions can be deployed that drives on-going co-creation processes. Originality/value: This study is the first empirical research to offer insights into important pre-conditions and subsequent outcomes concurrently to illustrate how customers’ VCB can be managed and nurtured for sustainable value co-creation processes within service systems.

The argument is inspired by Austin's question of what it is that gives language its performative force. What are the conditions which connect sentences to certain effects? Advancing this question from the level of sentences to a societal level, and taking inspiration from the failure of Marxist notions of the relation between theory and practice, the paper suggests thinking critical performativity under the conditions of differentiation. This idea is qualified by means of Niklas Luhmann and his theory of a functionally differentiated - or polycontextural - society. Functional differentiation and polycontexturality mean that systems cannot communicate with each other; there is no real transfer of scientific knowledge into practice. Unhappy performativity is the rule. Based on this insight the paper discusses elements of a critical research strategy - under polycontextural conditions - and four guidelines for a critical science are suggested.","Critical management studies; Critical performativity; Critical theory; Functional; Luhmann; Polycontextural society; Polycontexturality; Science; Systems theory; Theory and practice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020659591

This study argues that Halal food certificate implementation positively influences business performance. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 210 Halal certified food manufacturing companies in Malaysia participated in the study. Data were gathered through a structured questionnaire and were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling technique. Findings: The study proved that HFC has a positive relationship with operational performance. Additionally, operational performance mediates the relationship between HFC and financial performance. Altogether, this signifies that Halal food certificate implementation positively influences business performance. Practical implications: By linking HFC and business performance, managers may be aware of the significant role of HFC in influencing operational and financial performance. It would entice more food companies to become Halal certified that opens up an opportunity to a lucrative Halal food industry. It also empirically justifies that a religion-based food certification has the ability to influence business performance, consistent with other established food standards such as ISO 22000 or HACCP. Originality/value: Although numerous studies have concentrated on well-established food certifications, the expanding Muslim population, rising demand for Halal food, and lucrative Halal food market have raised the attention on HFC research among academicians and practitioners.

The purpose of this paper is to elaborate on the roots of the emerging research stream on service modularity, provide a concise overview of existing work on the subject, and outline an agenda for future research on service modularity and architecture. The articles in the special issue offer four diverse sets of research on service modularity and architecture. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is built on a literature review mapping the current body of literature on the topic and developing future research directions in service modularity and architecture. Findings: The growing focus on services has triggered needs to investigate the suitability and implementation of physical-product-focused modularity principles and theories in service contexts, and to search for principles/theories that enhance services. The expanding research stream has explored various aspects of service modularity in empirical contexts. Future research should focus on service-specific modularity theories and principles, platform-based and mass-customized service business models, comparative research designs, customer perspectives and service experience, performance in context of modular services, empirical evidence of benefits and challenges, architectural innovation in services, modularization in multi-provider contexts, and modularity in hybrid offerings combining service and tangible product modules.

Previous studies indicate that risk communication not always is able to influence people's behavior and that pre-existing attitudes may influence people's reactions and reflections. In this study, we investigate how consumers critically reflect and emotionally react to a food scare, here defined as risk communication that spirals public anxiety over food safety incidents, and leads to an unwanted escalation in media attention. Fall 2014, a researcher from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a newspaper interview that she never touched chicken with her bare hands. This interview was the beginning of a media storm, which resulted in a dramatic drop in sales of chicken. In this study, we explore a small group of consumers' reflections and reactions to this news article. Data from five focus group interviews with Norwegian consumers of chicken were transcribed, content analyzed, and coded, before we conducted a multiple correspondence analysis and a hierarchical cluster analysis in JMP Pro 12.

This idea is anchored in the observation that most institutions of higher education tend to teach their students to become employees, whether in the public or private sector, rather than to become employers. Thus, the mindset with which we equip our students is not sensitised to entrepreneurial action. Therefore, the aim of this chapter is to propose and illustrate a more comprehensive approach to teaching entrepreneurship, which aims to transform the way that students think about entrepreneurship. In order to achieve this objective, we identify and develop techniques for promoting entrepreneurial awareness and preparedness in our student population, and provide tools for educators to promote the individual’s innate drive to perfect him/herself, thus recognising his/her own need for personal growth. At the theoretical level, we build on the authors’ teaching experiences from different cultural contexts, which show ways in which alternative learning initiatives may enhance enterprising thinking among students. Based on our experiences with the influence of context, we propose that it is necessary to consider seven different, yet interconnected teaching principles, which may influence the impact of entrepreneurship education and which relate to the why; where; when; what and how of entrepreneurship. In continuation, on a practical level, we suggest a coherent system of innovative educational techniques, so-called Verwunderungsübungen, or wonderment exercises, that can be used individually or in combination. By creating a comprehensive teaching paradigm for entrepreneurship we pay tribute to entrepreneurship being an inherently dynamic phenomenon, which goes beyond exclusively focusing on new venture creation. © 2017 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Entrepreneurship education; Teaching principles; Wonderment exercises",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019733640

Emerging market multinationals (EMNCs) in specific are deploying increasingly activist measures to harness foreign sources of knowledge and innovation as a strategy to build up their firm-specific resources and capabilities. In the following, we argue that EMNCs' strategic asset-seeking investments constitute a particularly interesting class of investments, as it presents important challenges to international business theory, firm strategy and public policy. We argue that outward investment to acquire strategic assets abroad at the scale we observe today is a recent addition to the instrument set deployed by emerging economies for development. We proceed to discuss how this type of investments does not sit well with mainstream international business theory and propose ways in which this disagreement can be reconciled through recognition of other EMNC advantages, particularly abilities to leverage country-specific assets, and possession and development of dynamic capabilities. Finally, we identify a set of core themes in the recent literature on strategic asset-seeking investments and relate them to the contributions in the current special issue.

Inattention to this question renders incomplete current perspectives on democratic processes of accountability, even as politicians are increasingly provided with performance data to hold bureaucrats accountable. We shed light on this issue using a survey experiment of elected officials featuring actual performance data. We find that the provision of performance data makes elected officials more willing to attribute causal responsibility to bureaucratic leaders, but only in cases of low performance, suggesting a negativity bias in public sector responsibility attribution processes.

Findings: The findings show that when the assortment size increases, consumers acquire information from more products and cues but sacrifice product attributes. In particular, this sacrifice comes at the expense of secondary product attributes (e.g. nutrition information, country of origin), whereas primary product attributes (e.g. brand name, price) remain constant. Attribute quantity does not have a significant effect on information search. Practical implications: Provided that several strategies rely on providing more information to consumers with the aim of making more deliberate and better choices, the findings suggest that they may have a limited effect in product categories in which the assortment size is wide.

It is the purpose of this paper to describe the methods for reducing health inequity developed in the study and to discuss how action learning methodologically contributed to achieving these results. Design/methodology/approach: In the study, the front-line staff from 19 health and social service units in six different municipalities, in Denmark, each formed an action learning group to develop methods for reducing health inequity in a municipal health setting. Each group was guided by an external facilitator, according to an Action Learning Action Research phase model (ALAR-model), which structured the cyclical development of methods into four phases: diagnosing, planning action, taking action and evaluating action. Findings: Two types of results of the study are reported in the paper. First, the authors present an overview of the results the 19 participating municipal units have achieved in their action learning processes, as well as two case examples of how two units have worked with action learning and the concrete methods and tools they have developed in this process. Second, they report the challenges and dilemmas the 19 units faced when working with action learning in the study.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design was adopted for this study. A total of 30 executives from textile manufacturing suppliers in China, India, and Bangladesh were interviewed to determine their perceptions of distributive justice in relation to their key customers’ sustainable sourcing initiatives. Findings: Most of the interviewees perceived that their customers’ assessment of governance initiatives was unfair. Four types of suppliers are identified based on their varying perceptions of the equity equation. Research limitations/implications: The findings introduce distributive justice as an important mediating variable between assessment-based governance and compliance. They also provide insights into the various types of perceived costs, rewards, and investments related to sustainable sourcing, and how they form varieties of the equity equation. The findings rely on a limited number of respondents and should, therefore, be researched further. Practical implications: Assessment based on codes of conduct and auditing is the most prevalent sustainable sourcing governance approach, but suppliers may perceive this as an injustice leading to non-compliance. Buying companies are therefore advised to consider supplier perceptions of costs, rewards, and investments and adapt their sustainable sourcing initiatives accordingly. Social implications: Increased consideration of distributive justice in sustainable sourcing should increase the likelihood of supplier compliance, improving conditions for employees in global textile plants. Originality/value: Extant research has studied the connection between assessment-based sustainability governance and compliance or overall performance.

The result is a juxtaposition of shared value from either a corporate or a societal perspective, providing only little attention to the actual communication processes supporting the creation of shared value. The purpose of this paper is to re-conceptualize shared value creation from a communicative approach as an alternative to the current situation caught between the management and societal perspectives.

Findings: The study finds that the nursing staff and their frontline leaders experience challenges in regard to visibility and role of the leader, e.g., in creating overview, coordination, setting-up clear goals, following up and being in touch. However, large wards also provide flexibility and development possibilities. Practical implications: The authors discuss the implications of these findings for decision makers in deciding future SOC and for future SOC research. Originality/value: Only few studies have qualitatively explored the consequences of large SOC in hospitals. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Leadership; Nurse leader; Nurses; Organization; Size; Span of control","hospital; hospital management; hospital personnel; human; leadership; nurse administrator; nursing staff; Hospital Administration; Hospitals; Humans; Leadership; Nurse Administrators; Nursing Staff; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Personnel, Hospital",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019083914

In other words: A clash occurs between business and morality. In this chapter, we explore how this fundamental dilemma is replicated in CSR communication contexts. The purpose is to conceptually explore CSR dilemmas in communication contexts in order to develop an integrative framework for understanding the complexity of and communicative dilemmas embedded in CSR. Framed by three communication disciplines (integrated marketing communication, organisational communication and corporate communication), we outline how CSR is applied, and how it changes and redefines key concepts within each discipline. CSR generates new stakeholder demands and social expectations towards the organisation; the question is how the organisation manages and communicates this new role of responsibility. On that basis, we discuss how the CSR dilemma manifests as three communicative dilemmas: A self-promotion dilemma related to challenges of promoting CSR without simultaneously demonstrating its organisational anchoring; an identification dilemma related to the challenges of creating CSR value for employee identification without becoming a normative tool of employee identity control; and a relation dilemma, which is concerned with the challenges related to stakeholder engagement and the balancing of how to integrate the multivocality of different, opposing stakeholders without compromising the ideal of representing one unified corporate entity. The insights of the chapter contribute to the literature on CSR and CSR communication by providing a more nuanced understanding of the challenges and complexity of CSR communication, manifested as communicative dilemmas. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Communicative dilemmas; Corporate communication; CSR communication; Ethics; Integrated marketing communication; Organisational communication",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019072657

In this editorial, the authors take the opportunity to share the latest knowledge, research and insights on CSRCom as presented at the third International CSR Communication Conference held in Ljubljana 17-19 September 2015. Design/methodology/approach: Many efforts have been made to map the research field of CSRCom. Two major ontological streams seem to stand out in CSRCom research: functionalism vs constructivism. In this editorial, the authors describe each of them, address the factors which contributed to their implementation within the CSRCom field and provide a rationale for bridging the two approaches. Findings: The papers selected for the issue demonstrate that recent studies of CSRCom are anchored both in functionalism and constructivism but that the attention towards using CSRCom in organisational processes of collaboration and networking is growing. This growth is aligned to the changes in the wider social environment. In this editorial, the authors are bridging both approaches and relating them to the most recent developments in CSR and CSRCom. Originality/value: This paper concludes that a growing body of empirical studies contributes to an increased understanding of how both functionalistic and constitutive perspectives are relevant and provide key insights for communication managers. It also accentuates the idea that the ability to expand the understanding of CSRCom from that of a means to an end to one, according to which communication represents an important end/goal in itself, that can play a crucial role in dealing with the growing complexity of CSR processes. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility communication; CSR; Value creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019066178

The authors aim to adopt a novel approach to stakeholder measurement, as the traditional stakeholder model is constrained by its static two-dimensional nature, which captures neither the nuances of the stakeholder literature nor the dynamics of the firm's stakeholder universe. Design/methodology/approach - Empirically, the paper is based on findings from a survey among 492 Swedish fashion manufacturers and retailers. Findings - The paper reports significant discrepancy between the conventional stakeholder model and the perceptions of real-life managers of the stakeholder environment. On the surface, their understanding is more in line with the managerial model of the firm from which the stakeholder literature originally departs. It is argued, however, that the discrepancy may be rooted in technology rather than theory as the stakeholder model is constrained by its static two-dimensional nature, which captures neither the nuances of the stakeholder literature nor the dynamics of the firm's stakeholder universe. The paper, therefore, introduces an animated alternative to the conventional stakeholder model that provides a richer graphical representation of a firm's stakeholder universe. Research limitations/implications - The paper refers to the open-ended questions in the survey in terms of descriptive statistics, and not the entire quantitative measures in the survey. This is because these questions are crucial to the authors' approach to the suggested new stakeholder model, which is not tested quantitatively, but should be perceived as explorative - as a qualitative outcome of the survey. The survey is conducted through the web in the Swedish fashion industry only; thus; the authors' suggested model needs further quantitative qualification, which the authors plead for in future research. Originality/value - The originality of the paper is its novel approach to stakeholder measurement based on the perceptions of real-life managers of the stakeholder environment of the Swedish fashion industry. The traditional stakeholder model is constrained by its static two-dimensional nature, which the paper's animated three-dimensional alternative provides a richer graphical representation of a firm's stakeholder universe. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Fashion; Stakeholder management; Stakeholder model; Stakeholder salience; Sweden",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019014906

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on literature within framing, digital issue arenas and critical discourse, this study analyses qualitative hypermodal data retrieved from two websites: Protect Mauna Kea, and Maunakea and Thirty Meter Telescope. These two websites frame the internationally renowned telescope’s construction on Mauna Kea Mountain in Hawaii from alternative perspectives. Findings: On each website, frame articulation attempts to connect the event to specific concerns, values and beliefs in order to construct alternative versions of reality which can possibly fit with those of supporters. Simultaneously, this is reinforced by frame amplification concretized in selected discursive and interactive strategies that highlight or downplay the issue from particular perspectives. Originality/value: The study offers a deep insight into the complexity and dynamic nature of framing, in particular into how framing can vary and compete across actors.

Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based mainly on archival data, but supported by interview material as well as participant observation data. The authors do this from the assumption that the culturally constructed notion of the ideal soldier is based on a historically constructed professional narrative. Findings: The authors show how a historically produced gender narrative – based on (fictional) stories on what women can and cannot do – is perceived as true and thereby casts women as less suitable for a military career. Thus, despite the current equal legal rights of men and women in the military, the power of the narrative limits female soldiers’ career possibilities. Originality/value: The paper is unique as it, in drawing on archival data, is able to trace how an organizational narrative comes to be and due to its ethnographic data how this creates limitations for women’s careers. This narrative is stronger and much more powerful than management is aware of.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors used a qualitative approach to understanding low-intensity conflict relying on 170 interviews in four Danish MNCs. Findings: They describe consequences of low-intensity conflict and identify three types of actions by headquarters’ representatives that could lead to the development of low-intensity conflicts, namely, ignoring, bypassing and educating.

The purpose of this paper is to examine two types of corporate responses to these expectations: overt and covert responses. Specifically, it examines oil companies’ involvement in multi-stakeholder initiatives and sponsorships (overt responses) and their monitoring of critics, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and activist organisations (covert responses). Design/methodology/approach: Theoretically, the paper draws on theories of visibility and post-political regulation. Empirically, it focuses on case studies of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), Shell and BP, drawing on qualitative methods. Findings: The paper demonstrates that overt responses create an impression of consensus between antagonistic interests and that covert responses support this impression by containing deep-seated conflicts. Research limitations/implications: Corporate responses have implications for the role of the corporation as a (post-)political actor. By containing antagonism and creating an impression of consensus, the interplay between overt and covert responses open up further possibilities for the proliferation of soft governance and self-regulation through participation in voluntary transparency and corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. Data on covert practices of corporations are difficult to access. This impedes possibilities for fully assessing their extent. The findings of this paper support trends emerging from recent research on covert corporate intelligence practices, but more research is needed to provide a systematic overview. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the understudied area of covert corporate activity in research on the political role of multinational corporations. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate and social responsibility; Corruption; Social action; United Kingdom; World Wide Web",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018281768

However, it remains challenging for them to actually capture that value using traditional Intellectual Property (IP) tools. In this paper, we document the strong growth in patents, trademarks, and industrial designs used by firms to protect their IP globally. We then show that IP protection remains fragmented; the quality of IP applications might be questionable; and developing a comprehensive IP footprint worldwide is very costly. Growing numbers of applications are causing backlogs and delays in numerous Patent and Trademarks Offices and litigation over IP rights is expensive, with an uncertain outcome. Moreover, local governments can succeed in transferring value to local firms and influencing global market positions by using IP laws and other regulations. In essence, the analysis shows a global IP environment that leaves much to be desired. Despite these challenges, there are successful strategies to capture value from know-how and reputation by leveraging an array of IP tools. These strategies have important implications for management practice, as we discuss in our concluding section. Global companies will need to organize cross-functional value capture teams focused on appropriating value from their know-how and reputation by combining different institutional, market, and nonmarket tools, depending on the institutional and business environment in a particular region.

That is, how can one make a critical difference without becoming embroiled with or turning into the powers that be? This chapter offers suggestions for how to remain critical and queer by first introducing the notion of queer posing then exploring its conditions of possibility in terms of performativity and affectivity, respectively. Here, we encounter another seeming impasse between the epistemological voluntarism of which studies in the performative vein are sometimes accused and the charge of ontological determinism that is often levelled against affect theory. Turning from vain dichotomies to productive tensions, we propose that potential for critical performativity is inherent to affective organizing of materiality as events in relation to which action becomes possible. The concept of plasticity, we suggest, enables investigations of the simultaneously formed and formative character of being and, further, the explosive potential of critique - the shaping of corporeal events is not only confining, but also holds potential for blowing up existing configurations. On this basis, we sketch three plastic relations of affectivity and performativity, three modes of organizing material assemblages as actionable events: invitation, intervention, and celebration. We illustrate the performative power and critical potential of these three modes of affective organizing by indicating how they give form to, are formed by, and become explosive to Sabaah, a Danish activist network and community for LGBT people with minority ethnic background. © 2017 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","CMS; LGBT; Minority ethnic; Organizing; Plasticity; Queer",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017454725

This longitudinal study used a mixed method approach to examine the social support benefits of expatriate contact with a local host. Western expatriates in the Netherlands were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group (n = 33), that had contact with a Dutch host during 9 months, and a control group (n = 32) with no host. Qualitative methods such as interviews and diaries were included to shed light on the various types of social support that occurred. Results show that local hosts offered all four types of social support: social companionship, informational support, emotional support, and instrumental support. Furthermore, expatriates with a host increased their social capital; they received significantly more social support from host nationals than did those without a host. This study shows that HRD professionals may develop the social capital of expatriates by bringing them into contact with a local host, which can produce more social support from host nationals.

Building on the stimulus-organism-response framework and theories of emotional contagion and feelings-as-information, the main hypothesis was that a smiling (vs non-smiling) employee significantly increases customer satisfaction through the mediating influence of pleasure. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a quasi-experimental two-group between-subjects design. A total of 210 customers at a large retail bank had a brief service encounter at the store entrance with a smiling (vs non-smiling) bank teller. Customers then went into the bank to do what they came to do. Before leaving the bank, customers completed a survey that included demographic information, affect (pleasure, arousal, and dominance), and measures of customer satisfaction. Findings: A smiling (vs non-smiling) employee had a significant positive impact on customer satisfaction. This effect was mediated by pleasure, but also, to a weaker extent, by dominance. These results contradict previous claims that smiling-induced emotional contagion does not remain throughout the completion of a service encounter. Practical implications: Managers should encourage, and potentially train, employees to act in ways associated with positive emotions. Managers could also hire employees based on how good they are at acting and expressing themselves in a genuinely positive manner and create a pleasant store atmosphere so that the feelings and behaviors displayed by frontline employees are genuine rather than inauthentic. Originality/value: This is the first experimental field study to examine the isolated effect that employee-displayed smiling has on customers’ affective states and satisfaction. The results provide more direct evidence for the psychological processes justified by emotional contagion and feelings-as-information theories. Furthermore, the finding that dominance mediates the smiling-satisfaction link has never been shown before. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affect; Customer satisfaction; Emotional contagion; Feelings-as-information; Field study; Smiling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017311807

Practical implications: The research leads to the development of a tool for uncertainty management for sustainability of complex projects, which is termed “UMSCoPS”. The model provides a guide for insight and understanding of uncertainty management. Originality/value: The previous knowledge on managing uncertainty for sustainability of complex projects is enhanced regarding the uncertainty management in complex projects. The approach to uncertainty has returned to the original notion of the “unknown unknowns”, and project management thereby leaves the widely used stage gate approach. The developed tool provides a fresh understanding of the challenges of uncertainty. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ambidextrous organization; Complex projects; Exploration and exploitation; Frontload; Project management; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016772578

The authors also endeavor to uncover the role gender plays in moderating the aforementioned relationship between e-WOM and distrust. Design/methodology/approach - The research model was validated via a field survey administered on 115 college students and faculty members, who had been exposed to a custom-developed online restaurant review website. SmartPLS 2.0.M3 was employed to verify both the measurement and structural properties of the research model. Findings - Distrust reduces male consumers' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use toward an online service provider while increasing their adoption intention. For their female counterparts, distrust reduces both perceived ease of use and adoption intention for an online service provider. Additionally, for male consumers, only opinionated review aids in alleviating distrust. Conversely, both numerical rating and opinionated review aid in alleviating the distrust of female consumers. Moreover, in contrast to their female counterparts, male consumers are less susceptible to the influence of cognitive dissonance between numerical rating and opinionated review. Research limitations/implications - This study integrates distrust with the technology acceptance model (TAM) in an attempt to gain a deeper appreciation of technology acceptance behavior. Furthermore, this study builds on the confirmation bias theory to delineate e-WOM into numerical rating and opinionated review in order to better explicate variations in how males and females react to these two distinct forms of e-WOM. Consistent with the cognitive dissonance theory, the distinction between numerical rating and opinionated review enables further exploration of the impact of cognitive dissonance between these two forms of e-WOM on male and female consumers' distrust of online service providers. Finally, this study unveils contrasting conflict resolution strategies adopted by male and female consumers to cope with cognitive dissonance in e-WOM. Practical implications - Findings from this study yield prescriptions for practitioners in terms of how e-WOM can be harnessed to alleviate consumers' distrust of online service provider. Whereas it is crucial for online service providers to draw on opinionated review to reduce distrust for male consumers, numerical rating should be emphasized for female consumers. This study also sensitizes practitioners to the drawback of providing both numerical rating and opinionated review at the same time due to the potential for cognitive dissonance. Originality/value - This study is the first to: position distrust within the well-accepted TAM in order to enrich the understanding of technology acceptance behavior; testify to the importance of delineating between numerical rating and opinionated review due to the possibility of cognitive dissonance between these two distinct forms of e-WOM, as well as; uncover contrasting conflict resolution strategies adopted by male and female consumers to cope with cognitive dissonance in accordance with the confirmation bias theory. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cognitive dissonance; Confirmation bias theory; Distrust; E-WOM; Numerical rating; Opinionated review","Rating; Students; Cognitive dissonance; Cognitive dissonance theories; Confirmation bias; Design/methodology/approach; Distrust; Electronic word of mouths; Numerical rating; Technology acceptance model; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016390108

To answer this question, a conceptual framework is developed, based on an extensive literature review. Additionally, the authors introduce how adidas, as one of the world's top sports brands, is managing such a transformation. Data were gained from direct observations of the project on-site and expert meetings, as well as from analysis of internal company documents. This results in an extension of the conceptual framework by adding case specific characteristics. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to deliver a model that can be used as an orientation in today's corporate environment to follow all steps of the learning transformation in proper sequence and to consider all relevant elements. One finding is that companies have to be aware of the demands of new learners, which needs to be a leading principle for companies that implement a learning transformation. In subsequent processes, the organisation has to create clear objectives, implement a suitable corporate culture and establish learning spaces, followed by launching and promoting all the various ways of learning.

Nevertheless, business cases are often poorly linked to value creation activities and organizations struggle to develop business cases that are useful and express more than simple cost savings. This action research study seeks to improve the usefulness of business cases in IS projects. We used collaborative action research with Danish municipalities to improve their practices when developing and using business cases and to change their perceptions of what constitutes a good business case that is useful during implementation and value creation. This article presents lessons learned from our action research, lessons that we incorporated into a business case method and subsequently evaluated with IS managers. There are three lessons on (1) improving the content of business cases, (2) how to develop business cases, and (3) the use of business cases in subsequent value creation. These lessons summarize our findings and the contributions are that we in the business case method propose to (1) include minimal contents, (2) develop social commitment, and (3) structure for dynamic use during value creation.

Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework based on review of theory is applied within an empirical multi-case study that is part of a health intervention research project on increased physical activity among office workers. The study involves six Danish organizations. Findings - Middle managers play a key role in successful implementation of WHP, but feel uncertain about their role, especially when it comes to engaging with their employees. Uncertainty about their role appears to make middle managers reluctant to take action on WHP and leave further action to top management instead. Research limitations/implications - Limitations included the middle managers' low attendance at the half-day seminar on strategic health (50 percent attendance), the fact that they were all office workers and they were all from Denmark. Practical implications - Middle managers ask for more knowledge and skills if they are to work with WHP in daily business. Social implications - Implementing and embedding WHP as a health strategy raises ethical issues of interfering with employees' health, is seen as the employee's personal responsibility. Originality/value - This study adds to knowledge of the difficulties of implementing and embedding WHP activities in the workplace and suggests an explicit and detailed research design. ©Emerald Publishing Limited.","Implementation; Leadership; Middle manager; Physical activity; Work health promotion; Workplace health management","attendance rate; commercial phenomena; conceptual framework; controlled study; empiricism; exercise; health promotion; human; interpersonal communication; interview; knowledge; manager; normal human; office worker; personnel management; priority journal; questionnaire; Review; running; skill; training; workplace; yoga",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016135283

Analysis is conducted on survey data from a sample of wine consumers in Ontario, Canada. Product choice cues are grouped into extrinsic, intrinsic and marketing mix. The importance of how these cues are influenced from different dimensions of consumer involvement is illustrated. Findings: The results show that product knowledge has a positive impact on intrinsic product cue utilisation and further moderates this relationship improving the predictability of the hypothesised model. Implications for theory and practice are also discussed.

Based on the job demands-resources model the authors predict that good teacher-student relations, as a supportive job resource, will have a positive effect on expatriate academics’ job satisfaction. This effect, however, will be even stronger for individuals experiencing high job demands and challenges in terms of intercultural job adjustment. In other words, expatriate academics that have difficulties adjusting will benefit more from the social support that can originate from good relations to their students. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: The authors surveyed expatriate academics adjusting to a university position in China by use of 124 responses from foreign university employees. Findings: The authors found that teacher-student relations had a positive association with job satisfaction and that positive teacher-student relations increased job satisfaction more for individuals being slow to adjust.

The purpose of this paper is to traverse the fantasy of the heroic entrepreneur by offering a reading of Richard Branson’s autobiography, Losing My Virginity. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical approach of this paper is informed by Slavoj Žižek’s concept of fantasy and his critical analytical strategy of “traversing the fantasy”. Žižek offers a theoretical framework that allows us to understand how narratives of famous entrepreneurs create paradoxical fantasies that produce desire. Findings: By offering a reading of Richard Branson’s autobiography, Losing My Virginity, this paper serves to illustrate how the fantasy of the heroic entrepreneur creates the injunction to overcome oneself and become true to oneself, but also how this figure is ridden with contradictions and impossibilities. Branson’s book will eventually be shown to be a religious narrative, where the entrepreneur is responsible for redeeming the crises not only of the economy, but of being as such. Originality/value: Rather than striving towards a processual approach that lays emphasis on the collective effort involved in entrepreneurship, this paper critically engages directly with the heroic entrepreneur by exploring how this figure is a fantasy that structures desire. This paper shows how critical entrepreneurship studies could benefit from an approach that analyses how the cultural representation of business celebrates the heroic entrepreneur as a source of value creation.

The Hospitable Meal Model transcends and transforms existing meal models by presenting a more open-ended approach towards meal experiences. The underlying purpose of The Hospitable Meal Model is to provide the basis for creating value for the individuals involved in institutional meal services. The Hospitable Meal Model was developed on the basis of an empirical study on hospital meal experiences explored through different epistemological positions and inspired by a sociomaterial assemblage approach.

The key question explored is whether internationalisation of PSFs is a passive strategy driven by clients' internationalisation or if it is a deliberate search for opportunities that drives the internationalisation processes. This is being analysed by scrutinising the literature to check if this perspective can be understood and explained from an opportunity angle. The paper shows that there is no apparent pattern among the various PSF articles that relates to opportunities. Instead, it seems to be a very scattered landscape. However, the analysis reveals that there seems to be a focus on sub-industries or businesses rather than looking on PSF as a whole. In addition, the analysis indicates that opportunities are dealt with as an underlying issue closely related to the particular take on internationalisation for the individual article and therefore shows the same variation. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","internationalisation; opportunity; professional service firm",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014613706

One of the oft-listed explanations is the ability of public employees to block privatization. However, many studies on the influence of public employees on privatization do not use very precise measures of the influence of public employees, they have been unable to isolate a one-way effect, and the studies have not been attentive to whether the effect varies for different market forms. In this article, we focus on privatization in Denmark through a voucher market without price competition for eldercare services. Using new data for all 98 Danish municipalities in 2012, we are able to measure the strength of the public eldercare union as well as the number of the public eldercare workers relative to the number of local voters. We find that the increased union strength measured in terms of union density at the municipal level leads to substantially and significantly less privatization through the voucher market. By comparison, the estimated relationship between the relative number of public workers and privatization does not reach statistical significance. Features of the voucher market and qualitative evidence suggest that the union influence primarily goes through a direct user channel, that is through union influence directed at the service users, whereas a minor effect possibly runs through a political channel, that is lobbying directed at the local politicians. © The Author 2016.

Examining the effect of entrepreneur-, firm- and context- specific factors, it provides an insight into the start of internationalisation via exporting and its initiating features. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a qualitative research approach. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews from informants with conclusive decision-making power and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive coding. Findings: The findings show that the sample firms internationalise early exhibiting mostly proactive behaviour in finding international clients. Owner-manager international orientation and commitment combined with contacts in his or her social spaces lead to early export inducement despite the fusion of ownership and control, and regardless of transition context volatility and inefficiency. Research limitations/implications: The limitations include the sample size and its industry embeddedness limiting generalisability. The key implications are that family firms need support to develop their social spaces through encouraging and enabling linkages between socio-economic actors that can expand the bounded sociality of the firm. Originality/value: The owner-manager orientation, objectives, commitment and characteristics, coupled with the straightforward decision-making process that is safeguarded by full family ownership, can abate the dissuading role of the perceived lack of institutional support for small and medium-sized enterprise internationalisation in a transition context. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Family-owned firms; Inducing internationalisation; Owner-manager; Transition country context",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014012624

And given this shift in understanding, is there a need for a new paradigm in entrepreneurship learning? Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on ethnographic data from entrepreneurship education (EEd) at a summer school in Denmark. The purpose of the summer school was to bring the students from an awareness of their own competences to a shared understanding of resources, relationships and opportunities for becoming enterprising. Findings: Drawing on the recent developments in understanding creativity, the authors’ explore the potential for similarities between becoming an entrepreneur in collaboration with others and being creative in collaboration with others. The authors’ found that a focus on the collaborative and distributed character of entrepreneurship, as within the We-paradigm from creativity, does not exclude the importance of perceptions of individuals’ self-images as part of a course in entrepreneurship. Yet, a reformulation of these could be an entry point for richer group work and articulation of diverse group potential. Research limitations/implications: This study suggests that it is possible to take at least one step further in what can be achieved during an EEd course. Rather than remain a focus on individual learning and treating group work a didactics instrument, team formation processes can be used as a pedagogy/andragogy experiential tool in the classroom with its own learning outcomes, as presented and discussed above. For educators, this means that they have an additional tool to aid the complicated task of bringing EEd to students across campus. For students, this new approach means that the often dreaded and frustrating process of classroom team formation can become a positive experience of purposeful team assembly and collaboration. Two possible limitations regarding the findings of this paper can be identified: for students with extensive experience in forming teams and working in groups, taking them through this process may not have the desired effect as they may rely on habits and known mechanism without much reflection; it may be difficult to achieve the desired effect with students that know each other well before the course starts, as they may have too strong hidden agendas about who they want to work with and who they do not want to work with that this will over-power the idea/opportunity/subject-matter driven approach (Aldrich and Kim, 2007). Educators should consider if they may be subject to these limitations as this may have an effect on the use of active, opportunity-driven team formation in practise. To counter the second limitation, educators may want to consider how far into a course they want to facilitate the team formation; especially for courses running over significantly longer periods than two weeks. Future research may be able to assess the significance of these limitations. Practical implications: This paper explores how students experience and handle a shift from an individual to a collaborative understanding of entrepreneurship imposed on them by the novel and unique design of a course that explicitly incorporates the team formation process into the curriculum. This is undertaken to gauge the extent to which students experience this shift as fitting the actual and perceived need for shared practices in developing enterprising behaviour, and to shed light on what action/process-based EEd courses may benefit from actively including a team formation process in the course design. Social implications: EEd may be offered for a number of reasons. New enterprises are seen as a potential source of economic wealth and for the student, this type of education offers the possibility of using their knowledge in new ways, becoming entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs. Also, from the perspective of both the higher education institution and the student, in the fast changing world in which we live, the digital mobility and multiplicity of work environments requires a workforce that possesses a range of individual competences. Such as being persistent, engaged and having good ideas, competences that are difficult to teach and hard to learn. Adding to our knowledge of how to handle these concerns, the paper points at a number of social implications of EEd. Originality/value: The research conducted in this research paper contributes to the field of EEd by exemplifying how conceptual understandings of entrepreneurship as a collective enterprise, rather than an individual one, impact students’ understanding and experience of entrepreneurship. Furthermore, it provides a foundation for expanding research aimed at providing students with a learning experience more in line with the everyday life of an entrepreneur. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaborative; Course design; Entrepreneurship; Higher education; Learning; Student’s perception",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013031223

However, decision fatigue related to the time of day when respondents answer questionnaires has been largely overlooked in this literature even though time of day related fatigue effects are well known in the psychology literature. The purpose of this paper is to hypothesize that variations in the time of day when respondents answer an online food choice experiment will translate into observable fatigue effects in the food choices. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical SCE concerning food choices is conducted using a web-based questionnaire for interviews in a pre-recruited online panel of consumers. Timestamps collected during the online interviews provide knowledge about the time of day at which each respondent has answered the survey. This information is linked with knowledge from a food sociology survey on typical meal times as well as biophysical research linking food intake to blood sugar and mental energy in order to generate a proxy variable for each respondent’s level of mental energy when answering the food choice tasks in the questionnaire. Findings: Results show evidence of a time of day effect on error variance in the stated food choices as well as the subsequently estimated market share predictions. Specifically, respondents provide less consistent answers during the afternoon than at other times of the day. Originality/value: The results indicate that time of day can affect responses to an online survey through increased fatigue and correspondingly less choice consistency. Thus, especially online surveys might account for this in data analysis or even restrict accessibility to the online survey for certain times of day. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Error variance; Fatigue effects; Food choice; Online surveying; Paradata; Stated choice experiments; Time of day",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012928454

With wages in former low-cost countries and automation/robotization increasing, these decisions are increasingly contested. Re-evaluations of “shoring” decisions inherently create a need to re-examine theoretical and academic contributions to this rapidly changing phenomenon. Therefore, the special issue sought manuscripts that added to the exciting and dynamic body of knowledge on “rightshoring”. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The paper starts out by delimiting outsourcing/insourcing and offshoring/reshoring as part of a conceptual “rightshoring” framework to establish a common terminology and context for the insights gathered in the special issue. It illustrates that “shoring” options can be classified along geographical and governance dimensions. Findings: Both the geographical and governance dimensions are part of the rightshoring decision which is an important conceptual foundation for this special issue, as it invited insightful pieces on all of these phenomena (e.g. outsourcing, insourcing, offshoring, reshoring), acknowledging that these decisions are embedded in the same context – firms making governance and location decisions. Therefore, papers 1-4 primarily focus on offshoring, whereas paper 5 focuses on insourcing and paper 6 on reshoring. Their main findings are summarized in Table II. Research limitations/implications: Suggestions for future research out of the six papers are summarized in Table III. There is ample opportunity to further shed light on these suggestions as well as to cover parts of the “rightshoring” framework presented, that remain less covered here (e.g. insourcing and/or reshoring). Practical implications: The array of potential “rightshoring” options fosters clarity about the phenomena studied and their implications.

The purpose of this paper is to understand how such a service production system changes as a consequence of offshoring. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on practice theory, the paper investigates how offshoring leads to reconfiguration of the service production system. Through a multiple case methodology, the authors demonstrate how agents and structures interact during reconfiguration. Findings: The paper analyses the reconfiguration of components of a service production system in response to change ignited by offshoring. The authors find recurring effects between structures that enable and constrain agents and agents who shape the structure of the production system. Research limitations/implications: The paper offers a novel contribution to the service operations management literature by applying practice theory. Moreover, the authors propose a detailed, activity-driven view of service production systems and service offshoring. The authors contribute to practice theory by extending its domain to operations management. Practical implications: Service production systems have the ability to self-correct any changes inflicted through offshoring of the systems, which helps firms that offshore. Originality/value: The paper is aimed at service professionals and offshoring managers and proposes a novel presentation of the service production system with a description of how it responds to offshoring.

Employees tend to have much less autonomy in their jobs. Conceivably, employees who lack job-autonomy may be motivated to seek autonomy and become entrepreneurs. Conversely, employees who have some job-autonomy may develop competencies and interest in becoming entrepreneurs. These two opposite arguments leads to ascertaining how young employees' job-autonomy discourages or encourages a vocational intention to become entrepreneur, and how such coupling is embedded in gender and culture. The sample is young employees in many countries, surveyed in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor Culture is measured in the World Values Survey. These two-level data reveal that job-autonomy promotes intention to become entrepreneur, especially for men. This gendering of the coupling between job-autonomy and entrepreneurial intention prevails in the world as a whole. Culture moderates effects, in that job-autonomous and female employees are more likely to become entrepreneurs in traditional culture than in modern culture. The findings enhance understanding of attraction to entrepreneurial careers, and especially attraction from employment to self-employment, and understanding the embeddedness of attraction in gender and culture.

A sample of 53,775 youths, including 6,117 immigrants, has been surveyed around Europe in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Although immigrants have less education and financial capital than indigenous youth, they have more entrepreneurial competencies and intentions, especially those originating from Africa and Middle East. Second generation immigrants are opportunity-alert and network more than indigenous and first generation immigrants, enhancing their entrepreneurial intention. Complementing the focus on immigrants' education and status attainment in earlier studies, this study focuses on their entrepreneurial competencies and intentions as shaped by their embeddedness in entrepreneurially intense home-societies.

The authors call these elements potentially misleading elements (PMEs) as they can give customers false expectations.

Combining different pairs of products, where one product had a PME, whereas the other did not, the authors could evaluate if preference correlated with the presence of a PME. Findings: The authors found both types of PMEs to have analogous effects on participants’ preferences and correlate with participants’ visual attention.

After its inception in the late 1990s, the concept of brandfests was quickly folded into the concept of brand community, leaving conceptual and strategic opportunities untapped. The purpose of the paper is to suggest a broadened conceptualization of brandfests based on the play theory and the notion of ludic interagency. Design/methodology/approach: This paper includes a longitudinal study and ethnographic method. Findings: Unlike previously studied brandfests, this context entails a low-involvement product, a brand that is not the focal point for participants, a broad range of market-facing enactors, shifting roles and the realization of multiple meanings and values for multiple enactors. The findings demonstrate that brand meaning and value can be constituted through ludic engagement of a broad range of market-facing enactors through a ludic spectacle such as a brandfest. Moreover, the authors find that this can go on outside the established spatial and temporal frames normally considered by the marketing literature. Research limitations/implications: This has implications for theories of emplacement (servicescape) and brand meaning actualization in terms of where, when and whom is involved in brand meaning actualization. Practical implications: The paper develops four strategic propositions which broaden the type of brandfests that allow managers to define a range of potential strategies for engaging consumers and other enactors in a broader range of brandfests. Originality/value: The paper reconceptualizes a dormant concept in the marketing literature to develop strategic implications based on the play theory.

Dual leadership means two leaders share the leadership task and are held jointly accountable for the results of the unit. To better understand how dual leadership works, this study aims to analyse three different dual leadership pairs at a Danish hospital. Furthermore, this study develops a tool to characterize dual leadership teams from each other. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews. Six leaders were interviewed to clarify how dual leadership works in a hospital context. All interviews were transcribed and coded. During coding, focus was on the nine principles found in the literature and another principle was found by looking at the themes that were generic for all six interviews. Findings: Results indicate that power balance, personal relations and decision processes are important factors for creating efficient dual leaderships. The study develops a categorizing tool to use for further research or for organizations, to describe and analyse dual leaderships.

However, the literature on this topic is sparse and offers only little support for store designers to deal with such challenges. To address this issue, the purpose of this paper is to identify the most important constraint generators, investigating the types of constraints they generate, and providing guidelines for how to deal with constraint elicitation. Design/methodology/approach: The three contributions mentioned above are developed through discussions of the literature and eight case studies of fashion store design projects. Findings: The paper shows that the influence of the constraint generators decreases during the design process except for supplier-generated constraints, which increase in the final stages of the design process. The paper argues that constraints should be elicited close to their occurrence, and that doing so requires a solid understanding of relevant constraint generators. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides a structured basis for further research and identifies areas warranting further study. Although, the paper’s focus is on fashion store design, the findings may, to some degree, be applicable to other types of store design projects. Practical implications: The understandings provided by this paper may help designers to deal proactively with constraints, reducing the use of resources to alter design proposals.

These innovations, such as mobile/SMS payments and online banking, contain features that are likely to influence how people choose to pay. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors that impact payers’ choice of payment instruments. Design/methodology/approach: Through in-depth interviews using the repertory grid technique, the authors explored 15 payers’ perceptions of six payment instruments, including coins, banknotes, debit cards, credit cards, mobile payments, and online banking. The approach draws heavily on organizational systematics to better understand payers’ choice of payment instruments. Findings: A four-category taxonomy of payments was developed. The authors refer to the taxonomy as the 4Ps: the purchase, the payer, the payment instrument, and the physical technology. The taxonomy comprises 16 payment characteristics consisting 76 payment features that influence payers’ instrument choice. One characteristic not known in prior research was identified – that is, “cancellation” – a characteristic more frequently associated with digital payment instruments than with cash or checks. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest that payers view payment instruments in a much broader sense, including context, control, or cultural beliefs. Consequently, the authors suggest that researchers try to understand the essence of an innovation before assuming any economic rationalism in human or organizational behavior. The authors also urge researchers to understand the underlying meaning behind constructs of interest; as this study has shown that concepts like context and convenience have many different interpretations. Practical implications: According to McKinsey (2014) there are over 12,000 startups in the payment arena. For them, the taxonomy can function as a template for the design of payment instruments, as well as understanding the various factors that influence payer choice of payment instruments. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is the 4Ps taxonomy of payments. The taxonomy builds on and extends the work by Hirschman (1982).

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an exploratory study in ten organizations. The data were collected in semi-structured interviews with ISM coordinators in Spring 2014. Findings: According to the ISM coordinators, four challenges were associated with introducing ISM: coworkers could perceive communication on ISM as not work related; coworkers might not understand the informal nature of communication on ISM, and self-censorship might stop them communicating on ISM; ISM was not considered a “natural” part of the daily routines in the organizations; and top managers mainly supported ISM in words, not in action. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on the perceptions of ISM coordinators. Further research is called for to explore both coworker perceptions and actual communication on ISM. Practical implications: Practitioners introducing ISM should be aware of these four challenges, and should help coworkers to make sense of communication on ISM as work-related communication among coworkers. ISM coordinators’ perceptions of their own role in relation to coworker communication on ISM make a difference.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on data obtained from 21 semi-structured interviews with respondents in 16 companies. The respondents were contacted following a genealogical exercise carried out on the 102 companies involved in the DGP between 1999 and 2003. Findings: The interviews suggested a rather critical perspective towards IC reporting using the ICS framework. Despite the attempt of the DGP to establish a reporting standard, a range of experiments resulted in changes to the framework’s original structure. Overall, a trend towards more integrated forms of reporting was discernible, in some part being motivated by the need to reduce the levels of reporting overload. Examples of integration designed to legitimise IC or corporate social responsibility reports, involving issuing them in tandem with a recognised reporting vehicle such as the annual report, were also encountered. Research limitations/implications: The implications of this study are that timely, value-relevant IC disclosures and compliant reporting, primarily for accountability purposes, have the potential to coexist. In addition to the usual limitations of a semi-structured interview research design, respondents’ difficulties in clearly recalling events during the project after some 10-12 years is a further potential limitation. Additionally, the use of internet-based communication channels for disclosure purposes was in its infancy at the time of the DGP. Originality/value: The paper provides important insights into the mechanisms of IC disclosure and IC reporting as seen from a practitioner perspective.

First, the level of abstraction from which internal management disclosures are constructed using current frameworks is too generic; and second, the current process of identifying relevant management disclosures is outdated. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to discuss whether contemporary conceptions of value creation from the field of business models can improve the currently applied frameworks used for generating internal management disclosures on intellectual capital. Hence, this paper offers a timely critique of the balanced scorecard, and other performance measurement concepts developed over the last 25 years. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews contemporary literature on the balanced scorecard, and related concepts, for generating internal management disclosures relating to intellectual capital. Furthermore, the problems that balanced scorecard type frameworks have as vehicles for constructing relevant internal management disclosures are explored. Findings: This essay argues that internal management disclosures need more precise underpinnings of value creation than offered by current frameworks. An empirically validated structure that establishes alignment between value creation and internal management disclosures, through the mechanism of business model configurations, is applied to overcome the two identified drawbacks of current practices. Research limitations/implications: This is a conceptual/normative offering. Practical implications: Following the critique, this essay prompts a new way forward for identifying internal management disclosures and performance measures, their validation, and subsequent benchmarking by expanding upon the concept of business model configurations. This concept offers a value driver platform with related clusters of KPIs connected to each of the 71 identified business model configurations as a starting point for management’s identification of relevant KPIs, and their analysis, benchmarking, and application for performance management. Originality/value: The arguments offered in this essay illustrate how it is possible to enhance the relevance of internal management disclosures by challenging and changing the normative level of abstraction applied. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced scorecard; Business models; Disclosure; Levels of abstraction; Performance measurement; Representation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009168857

Design/methodology/approach: A multiple case study based on semi-structured interviews with eight female entrepreneurs in the Danish fashion design industry. Findings: The results show that contrary to the traditional emphasis placed on the role of networks in the internationalization literature, the focal female entrepreneurs only spartanly used networks to expand into new foreign markets. Indeed, networks were used in only 24 of the 116 FMEs. The respondents largely attributed this reluctance to use networks to work-life balance issues and misgivings about knowledge misappropriation. In contrast, the focal entrepreneurs strongly attested to the decisive role played by information and communication technology (ICT) in allowing firms to enter foreign markets without incurring the costs of network membership or compromising their work-life balance.

Design/methodology/approach: Through an in-depth case study in the non-profit housing sector in Denmark, the research explored how residents perceive and co-create value in a long-term service relationship. The point of departure is an understanding of value co-creation as a phenomenological construct determined by the beneficiary, and the research is based primarily on the perspectives of service-dominant logic and customer-dominant logic. Findings: The research elucidated how value is both socially created and deconstructed through stories. Moreover, narrative analysis revealed how residents’ perceptions of services are deeply embedded in context and time. In this way, the study highlighted that the co-creation of value is inherently social and temporal. Practical implications: Understanding how value is perceived and negotiated by customers might assist practitioners to refine their understanding of value co-creation and lead them to address customers in more nuanced ways.

In this process students negotiate between the two identities of “student” and “entrepreneur”, both demanding in time, effort and commitment, and they in different manners struggle with balancing university belonging and entrepreneurial distinctiveness. Originality/value: The framework serves as a point of departure for discussing the psychological processes and tensions associated with students’ entrepreneurial identity construction, and what it means to entrepreneurship education. It is suggested that universities to a higher degree have to view themselves as psychological institutional moratoriums and thus as platforms of identity explorations rather than deterministic systems preparing students for certain careers to support students in becoming entrepreneurs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship education; Multiple identities; Student entrepreneurship; University",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008386011

The authors focus on three influential aspects, namely: the highest valued employee skills, main triggers for learning and investment in learning, as well as the most successful types of learning. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical research was designed according to abductive reasoning. The data draw on research we undertook between 2013 and 2015, including semi-structured interviews with management, human resources and union representatives, as well as questionnaire responses from a total of 31 EU and 163 EU-competitors, across 53 industries and 22 countries. Findings: Competence development requires flexible, learner-centred strategies for initiatives that respond to immediate business needs. Additionally, despite soft competences being so highly valued and sought after, investment (financial and other) by enterprises in developing them is low, relative to the investments poured into hard competences. Also, there is a clear employee demand gap for learning that develops soft competences. Originality/value: Findings and recommendations are based on a large-scale empirical study, providing state-of-the-art knowledge, upon which we can renew our current learning strategies in workplaces. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competence development; Empirical research; Learning strategies; Training and development; Workplace learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007569904

An analysis of public administration topics through a psychological lens can be useful to confirm, add nuance to, or extend classical public administration theories. As such, behavioral public administration complements traditional public administration. Furthermore, it could be a two-way street for psychologists who want to test the external validity of their theories in a political-administrative setting.

It is well-established that size effects due to large strain gradient effects play an important role at this scale and the present study aims to quantify these effects for the wire drawing process. Focus will be on investigating the impact of size effects on the most favourable tool geometry (in terms of minimizing the drawing force) for various conditions between the wire/tool interface. The numerical analysis is based on a steady-state framework that enables convergence without dealing with the transient regime, but still fully accounts for the history dependence as-well as the elastic unloading. Thus, it forms the basis for a comprehensive parameter study. During the deformation process in wire drawing, large plastic strain gradients evolve in the contact region. This creates a need for a higher order plasticity theory to accurately predict the material behaviour across the multiple scales involved. The present study reveals that the contribution from an energetic (recoverable) length parameter is limited, while the corresponding dissipative contribution dominates and tends to shift the drawing force to a higher level. As a direct consequence, the strain gradient hardening effect reduces the most favourable tool angle of a sharp tool with up to 50% (in terms of the required drawing force), whereas a circular shaped tool is proven less sensitive to scaling effects. By considering the contact force profile between tool and material it becomes clear that the strain gradients have a smoothing effect and both the magnitude and position of the peak pressure are affected significantly. A round tool is found to reduce the peak force, while the location of the peak is found to move from outlet to inlet depending on the tool geometry. © 2016 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Metal forming; Size effects; Steady-state; Strain gradient plasticity; Wire drawing","Drawing (forming); Metal forming; Plasticity; Size determination; Unloading; Wire; Wire drawing; Comprehensive parameters; Deformation process; Electrical components; Material behaviour; Plastic strain gradients; Size effects; Steady state; Strain-gradient plasticity; Metal drawing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007109380

Therefore, it is strongly recommended for small firms to open up for the external sources of knowledge, which could be obtained through network interaction. Based on two extreme cases of SMEs representing low-tech industry and an in-depth analysis of their manufacturing facilities this paper presents how collaboration between firms embedded in a regional ecosystem could result in implementation of new automation solutions. The empirical data collection involved application of a combination of comparative case study method with action research elements. This article provides an outlook over the challenges in implementing technological improvements and the way how it could be resolved in collaboration with other members of the same regional ecosystem. The findings highlight two main automation related areas where manufacturing SMEs could leverage on external sources on knowledge - these are assistance in defining automation problem as well as appropriate solution and provider selection.

These are as oriented toward politics and governance as they are toward more traditional utilitarian policy goals concerned with project delivery, or value for money (VfM). Indeed, governments have dozens of different goals in mind. Given mixed international results to date for VfM, it is posited that to the extent that infrastructure P3s continue to show popularity, governments may stress P3 success more on the basis of political and governance strengths, than utilitarian characteristics. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","contracting; infrastructure development; performance; policy; public–private partnerships",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006373487

One possibility is a more successful implementation of the state socialist vision of a centrally managed economy, possibly controlled by an AGI “Nanny” instead of a central committee of politicians. An alternative outcome, more in keeping with the original Marxist vision of the withering away of the state, may be the mutualist vision of organizing economic and social life along voluntary lines. A number of recent developments and new ideas may facilitate this outcome. The institution of the commons, in the past available only to small geographical communities, can now be used by global communities. Open collaboration and exchange networks facilitate voluntary cooperative activity by people at dispersed physical locations. Open Production Networks can make the most complicated economic exchanges transparent to consumers, allowing them to factor ethical and sociological considerations into their purchasing decisions. Offer Networks can help people with similar interests and complementary abilities to organize joint projects and organizations. Blockchain technologies could be used to create transparent currencies in which transactions can be done openly. These and other related technologies have the potential to humanize global economic interactions, giving them more emotional resonance, as increasing affluence lessens individual and societal preoccupation with maximizing economic gain. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Artificial general intelligence; Mutualism; Offer Networks; Open collaboration; Open exchange networks","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Artificial general intelligences; Cooperative activity; Exchange networks; Mutualism; nocv1; Open collaboration; Physical locations; Production network; Purchasing decisions; Economics; artificial intelligence; economic development; global economy; Marxism; voluntary approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85002601735

Therefore, a systematic and sustainability-focused evaluation system for supplier selection is needed from an organizational supply chain perspective. This work proposes a framework to evaluate sustainable supplier selection by using an integrated Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), ViseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR), a multi-criteria optimization and compromise solution approach. Initially, 22 sustainable supplier selection criteria and three dimensions of criteria (economic, environmental, and social) have been identified through literature and experts' opinions. A real world example of an automobile company in India is discussed to demonstrate the proposed framework applicability. According to the findings, ‘Environmental costs,’ ‘Quality of product,’ ‘Price of product,’ ‘Occupational health and safety systems,’ and ‘Environmental competencies’ have been ranked as the top five sustainable supplier selection criteria. In addition, out of the five sustainable supplier's alternatives, supplier number ‘three’ got the highest rank. The work presented in this paper may help managers and business professionals not only to distinguish the important supplier selection criteria but also to evaluate the most efficient supplier for sustainability in supply chain, while remaining competitive in the market. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to test the proposed framework robustness. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","AHP; Indian automobile industry; Supply chains; Sustainability; Sustainable supplier selection; VIKOR","Automotive industry; Commerce; Hierarchical systems; Industrial hygiene; Multiobjective optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Business organizations; Business professionals; Integrated frameworks; Multicriteria optimization; Occupational health and safety; Sustainable supplier selections; VIKOR; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994631181

Following this theoretical perspective, management forms the intended brand identity in a deliberate process and articulates this identity, surfacing as values and artifacts. Stakeholders develop and articulate values and artifacts in their own manner, but enact the brand identity at the same time. On the basis of data from a participatory ethnographic study, this research compares individual and collective articulations of a Nike related brand community with articulations of the intended brand identity. While earlier findings solely emphasize inside-out brand management or outside-in brand community perspectives, the findings of this article reveal a nested system of identities in the interplay between brand identities and community identities. This interplay creates synergy and tensions. Tensions in the nested system are important drivers for synergy. Due to the widespread and visible presence of brand artifacts on the collective identity level, coping with the resulting tensions is more urgent on the collective as compared to the individual level of the community.

In this paper, we present opportunities for future research on OI, organised at different levels of analysis. We discuss some of the contingencies at these different levels, and argue that future research needs to study OI–originally an organisational-level phenomenon–across multiple levels of analysis. While our integrative framework allows comparing, contrasting and integrating various perspectives at different levels of analysis, further theorising will be needed to advance OI research. On this basis, we propose some new research categories as well as questions for future research–particularly those that span across research domains that have so far developed in isolation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business model; collaboration; contingencies; crowdsourcing; ecosystems; entrepreneurship; governance; knowledge; Open innovation; organisation; platforms; research; review; strategy; theory","business; crowdsourcing; entrepreneur; governance approach; innovation; knowledge; research; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994613879

A replenishment problem based on joint pricing, dynamic investment in green operations, preservation technology, and optimal replenishment times for deteriorating items is considered as a way to maximize retailer profit. In this problem, the demand rate depends on the sales and reference prices as well as green concern level. Optimal control theory is employed to obtain a dynamic investment rate, and a simulated annealing algorithm is used to find the solution of the nonlinear constraint optimization problem, which determines the price, preservation technology investment, and replenishment cycle time. In addition, computational simulations and sensitivity analyses are carried out to offer managerial insights. The findings suggest that continuous investment in green operations and preservation technology can significantly improve the retailer's financial performance. The consumer reference price is an important influence on the retailer's decision to invest in green operations. Furthermore, results show that the higher price sensitivity of the market always discourages the retailer from investing in green operations. The retailer needs to invest more in green operations for products with relatively high unit value. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Green retailing; Optimal control; Preservation technology investment; Reference price; Simulated annealing algorithm","Computation theory; Constrained optimization; Costs; Deterioration; Investments; Optimization; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Simulated annealing; Green retailing; Optimal controls; Preservation technologies; Reference prices; Simulated annealing algorithms; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994592465

The article uses pesticides as case of hazardous products and identifies mechanisms in the downstream social and environmental management of a Danish pesticide company in vulnerable countries and especially in Brazil. The identified mechanisms are: the transnational company's on-going interpretation of the regulatory and ethical obligations for development and use of its hazardous products in vulnerable countries, path dependency and path creation in the business strategy, geographical and organisational coverage of the management systems and practices, the willingness of the company to address social and institutional vulnerability in use countries, and the roles of users and other actors in development and facilitation of more sustainable practices.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Nitrate concentration and runoff are site-specific and driven by climatic factors and crop management. As such, nitrate emissions may increase in the future due to climate change, affecting the marine eutrophication mechanism. In this context, and considering the case of spring barley production in Denmark, the paper has two objectives: (i) to estimate the present and future marine eutrophication impacts by combining a novel Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) modelling approach with a quantification of the effects of climate change on its parameterisation, and (ii) to discuss the implications of different normalisation references when comparing future Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) scenarios with current production systems. A parameterised characterisation model was developed to gauge the influence of future climatic-driven pressures on the marine eutrophication impact pathway. Spatial differentiation was added to the resulting ‘present’ and ‘future’ characterisation factors (CFs) and calculated for the Baltic and North Sea. The temporal variability of both midpoint normalised impact scores and damage scores reflect a 34% and 28% increase of the CFs in the North Sea and Baltic Sea, respectively. The temporal variability is mostly explained by CF variation and increasing future nitrogen flows. The marine eutrophication indicator scores at both midpoint and damage levels suggest that the differentiation of impacts to various receiving (and potentially perturbed) ecosystems is relevant. Damage scores are quantified with a factor 2.5 and 2.3 differentiation between the Baltic (higher) and North Seas (lower) for the present and future scenarios, respectively. The comparison of the normalisation methods, either based on total annual impacts (domestic inventory of background interventions), on ecological carrying capacity, or on the presently proposed method, point to the value of adding spatial differentiation to LCIA models. The inclusion of time variation and spatial differentiation in characterisation modelling of marine eutrophication and the identification of a paucity of adequate inventory data for future scenario analysis constitute the main outcomes of this study. Further research should aim at reducing the uncertainty of the parameterisation under future conditions and strengthening emissions projections. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Damage modelling; LCIA; Life Cycle Assessment; Marine ecosystems; Normalisation","Aquatic ecosystems; Characterization; Crops; Damage detection; Ecology; Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Life cycle; Nitrates; Damage modelling; Ecological carrying capacity; LCIA; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Nitrate concentration; Normalisation; Spatial differentiation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994043347

Applying motivation crowding theory to trust processes, we develop theoretical logic explaining how and under what conditions such third-party financial support negatively affects the local partner's trust. Our assertions were tested using archival and survey data on 105 international strategic alliances. We find that amount of support is detrimental to local partner trust but that the negative relationship can be dampened via interaction between partners and agreement throughout these interactions. This shows a need for partners to think through trust development consequences of external interventions during the setting up of their alliances, in order to be able to act in a manner which promotes trust. © 2016 British Academy of Management",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994013337

Therefore, a Life Cycle Assessment was carried out for the production of 1 kg of spring barley in Denmark, at farm gate. Both under 2010 and 2050 climatic conditions, four subscenarios were modelled, based on a combination of two soil types and two climates. Included in the assessment were seed production, soil preparation, fertilization, pesticide application, and harvest. When processes in the life cycle resulted in co-products, the resulting environmental impacts were allocated between the main product and their respective by-products using economic allocation. Impact assessment was done using the ReCiPe (H) methodology, except for toxicity impacts, which were assessed using USEtox. The results show that the impacts for all impact categories, except human and freshwater eco-toxicity, are higher when the barley is produced under climatic circumstances representative for 2050. Comparison of the 2010 and 2050 climatic scenarios indicates that a predicted decrease in barley yields under the 2050 climatic conditions is the main driver for the increased impacts. This finding was confirmed by the sensitivity analysis. Because this study focused solely on the impacts of climate change, technological improvements and political measures to reduce impacts in the 2050 scenario are not taken into account. Options to mitigate the environmental impacts are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Attributional LCA; Barley; Climate change; Future climate; Life Cycle Assessment","Climate change; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Toxicity; Attributional LCA; Barley; Climatic conditions; Future climate; Impact assessments; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pesticide applications; Technological improvements; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993958926

Little is known, however, about the lived experiences of this age group. In this article, we share information about the health- and ageing-related attitudes of women aged 45–55 years who took part in a physical activity intervention in Denmark. Drawing on Foucault’s concepts of disciplinary power and governmentality, we explored via 15 semi-structured interviews the women’s reasons for participation and their experiences with playing a team game. The interviews revealed that they had internalized the messages of ‘healthy ageing’ and felt guilty about their previous inactive lifestyle. However, their participation was also influenced by changing life circumstances.

The purpose of this study was to develop a functional unit to be used in LCA of foods that builds on the nutritional value of food products. We used the content and quality of proteins as a basis, and included dietary context as part of our method, since the nutritional value of a nutrient depends on the total dietary intake. Our method uses the digestible intake of the nine essential amino acids in the product and relates these values to the equivalent total dietary intake of the same amino acids. We also employed simpler functional units such as “gram (g) protein” and “g digestible protein.” We quantified the functional units for three dietary contexts and applied it on LCA results for bread, chicken fillet, minced pork, minced beef, milk and pea soup. The results showed that the relative differences between products changed when using a protein-based functional unit, with the largest change occurring when going from mass as the functional unit to g protein. By introducing protein digestibility, the systematic under-valuation of the animal products was partly avoided with little additional effort. The most advanced functional unit affected the results compared to the mass-based functional unit most, but required significantly more data. The impact of dietary context was smaller than expected; hence, it might be possible to simplify the inclusion of dietary context by using aggregated descriptions of diets. The method presented is valuable for adding an important aspect of nutrition (protein quality and content) to the LCA results of single products, but there is a large scope for development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Food; Functional unit; LCA; Nutrition; Protein","Amino acids; Animals; Environmental impact; Food products; Life cycle; Meats; Nutrition; Proteins; Animal products; Essential amino acids; Functional units; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methodological frameworks; Nutritional benefits; Nutritional value; Protein digestibility; Functional food",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84977151162

As business model design plays a key role for Born Globals, we link these two concepts. For this, we propose hypotheses about the influence of efficiency-centered and novelty-centered business model design on international firm performance. To test these hypotheses, we performed a quantitative survey with 252 founders of international companies in Germany, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Additionally, we gained further insights through a case study analysis of 11 Born Globals. The results show that business model design matters to international firm performance and the business model design of Born Globals tends to be more efficiency-centered. Based on a multiple case study, we analyzed business models in a more sophisticated way and derived propositions that yielded in an archetype of a Born Global's business model. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Born global; business model; international new venture; international performance; internationalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975470698

This article focuses on whether the policy positions of bureaucrats at the front lines of government are susceptible to frames and cues embedded in communication. Based on the notion that bureaucrats often adhere to certain professional norms when developing their attitudes toward policies, the authors hypothesize that communication frames and cues that align policies with such norms move bureaucrats’ policy positions in favor of the policy. Results of four studies in European and American settings among mid- and street-level bureaucrats show support for the hypothesized effect.

Its object is goodwill impairment tests (IAS 36) under the influence of International Financial Reporting Standards, which it uses to illustrate how financial accounting is produced. The aim is to investigate how accounting standards are translated into accounting practices, and to investigate how this is reliable. Drawing on actor network theory, the paper proposes calculative practices to be a networked and distributed affair. The study has two main contributions. Firstly, it shows that in the case of goodwill impairment tests, financial accounting is a process of finding, qualifying, stabilizing and calculating traces that often have to be found beyond the company infrastructure of sheets of accounts and the financial ledger. Secondly, it shows that these traces increase reliability when they are recognisable and impersonal. No single person is responsible for the financial calculation and the traces used assume that a firm cannot systematically outperform the broader economy or the history of the firm. It also helps to increase reliability if institutional roles such as auditors and valuation experts tolerate the calculation. Reliability increase when traces and supporting institutional actors that take part in the calculation are at a distance. Because of this production process, readers of financial statements face the following paradox: the things they see are less associated with specific entrepreneurial activities in the firm and more with normalised trends inside and outside the firm. Seeing the firm requires them to look at its past, at negotiated budgets, at its competitors, at industrial outlook, and at the statistical bureaus that compile information on the economic development of industries and countries; they may also have to listen to valuation experts and auditors. Seeing the value of a firm requires actors to look elsewhere. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963981972

In this paper the Cluster Support Vector Machine (CLSVM) methodology is proposed with the aim to increase the sparsity of the SVM classifier in the presence of categorical features, leading to a gain in interpretability. The CLSVM methodology clusters categories and builds the SVM classifier in the clustered feature space. Four strategies for building the CLSVM classifier are presented based on solving: the SVM formulation in the original feature space, a quadratically constrained quadratic programming formulation, and a mixed integer quadratic programming formulation as well as its continuous relaxation. The computational study illustrates the performance of the CLSVM classifier using two clusters. In the tested datasets our methodology achieves comparable accuracy to that of the SVM in the original feature space, with a dramatic increase in sparsity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","0-1 programming; Categorical features; Classifier sparsity; Clustering; Quadratically constrained programming; Support vector machine","leisure; support vector machine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957631525

The problem is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program under stochastic and highly time-variable demands. To deal with the stochastic demands, a Latin Hypercube Sampling method is applied to generate a fan of scenarios and then, a backward scenario reduction technique reduces the number of scenarios. Weighted mean-risk objectives by using different risk measures and minimax objective are examined to obtain risk-averse and robust solutions, respectively. Computational results are presented on a real-life case study to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approaches. To compare these different decision-making situations, a simulation approach is used. Furthermore, by several test problems, the performance of the stochastic model is investigated and the scenario generation method is evaluated in terms of in-sample and out-of-sample stability. Finally, sensitivity analysis on main parameters of the problem is performed to drive some managerial insights. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Risk consideration; Scenario reduction; Simulation; Solution׳s robustness; Stochastic programming; Supply chain network design","Decision making; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Computational results; Latin hypercube sampling methods; Manufacturing process; Scenario reduction techniques; Scenario reductions; Simulation; Supply chain network design; Two-stage stochastic programs; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950290578

This article reports research on exactly how, and how much, trust influences consumer decisions to buy new green products. It identifies consumer trust as a distinct volition factor influencing the likelihood that consumers will act on green intentions and strongly emphasizes the needs to manage consumer trust as a prerequisite for the development of a market for green products. Specifically, based on a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that lack of consumer trust is a barrier for the development of a market for organic food in Thailand. Two focus groups and ten in-depth interviews revealed low knowledge about and low trust in organic food, certification, control, and labeling. Further, a mall-intercept survey (N = 177) revealed that lack of (especially) system trust reduces consumer expectations about benefits of buying organic food, and it makes them less likely to buy organic food. Mistrust in the control system and in the authenticity of food sold as organic has a significant negative impact on self-reported buying behavior. Implications for policy and future research are discussed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consumer trust; Credence goods; Green products; Organic food; Survey study; Thailand; Theory of planned behavior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929678290

The most important policy statements include: The above-cited statement adopted at the WSSD, and the subsequent development of this 10-year framework under leadership of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the UN Department of Environmental and Social Affairs (UN DESA) through the Marrakech process3 The clear place for SCP in the sustainable development strategy adopted by the European Council in June 2006,4 which includes the task to develop an action plan for sustainable production and consumption in Europe by 2007 So, the change to sustainable production and consumption patterns has an important place on various policy agendas, but is it clear how to govern this change, and what such changes imply? The editors of this book, all affiliated to a major EU-funded project called Sustainable Consumption Research Exchanges (SCORE!), think that this is a hard and far from trivial nut to crack. They hence decided to dedicate the first of the two books that will be produced in the project to the question of how radical changes to SCP can be governed. Follow-up books will apply the lessons learned in the field of food, mobility, and energy and housing.
