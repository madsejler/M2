Currently, a range of frameworks exists that propose a vision for how to operate in a CE, by identifying and organising relevant circular strategies. However, these frameworks have a limited applicability for specific business types, in particular manufacturing, and are unsuitable for use in CE oriented innovation, due to a lacking ability to support innovation processes through: 1) creating a comprehensive understanding of circular strategies, 2) mapping strategies currently applied and 3) finding opportunities for improved circularity across a range of business processes. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a circular strategies framework for the manufacturing context, titled the Circular Strategies Scanner, which provides a comprehensive set of definitions of circular strategies and directly supports the early stages of CE oriented innovation. With this, the paper contributes to the body of work that develops CE transition methodology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular strategies framework; Closed loop; Innovation; Manufacturing companies; Resource productivity","Scanning; Business Process; Circular economy; Circular strategies; Closed loops; Innovation process; Manufacturing companies; Mapping strategy; Resource productivity; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072171339

A wide range of approaches have been proposed to help businesses plan for and implement circular strategies. Despite positive claims about the potential of circular economy implementation to simultaneously reduce environmental burden whilst enhancing business benefits, not all circular solutions (or circumstances) bring the desired positive effects, especially in the broader context of sustainability. For this reason, any decision to adopt a circular economy strategy ought to be carefully assessed with regards to its potential sustainability performance, prior to its implementation. While several attempts to measure or estimate the sustainability effects of circular economy strategies have been made, they often deploy methodologies that rely on multifaceted input information. Furthermore, such efforts provide results by means of employing lagging indicators, which are complex and may not be easily understood by decision-makers in a manufacturing company context. This paper provides a review of leading sustainability-related performance indicators, identified through a systematic literature review. As a result, more than 270 leading performance indicators have been retrieved and consolidated in a database. Subsequently, these indicators have been classified according to three categories: sustainability dimensions; business processes; and circular economy strategies. The key findings show that leading sustainability-related performance indicators are available for a wide range of Circular Economy strategies, thus making it possible to measure the potential sustainability performance of circular strategies prior their implementation. Furthermore, the specificities of leading indicators available for each classification category are presented, several gaps are identified and direction for future research is established. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Leading indicators; Manufacturing; Performance indicators; Sustainability screening","Benchmarking; Decision making; Manufacture; Circular economy; Environmental burdens; Leading indicators; Manufacturing companies; Performance indicators; Sustainability dimensions; Sustainability performance; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072017996

Despite good intentions, however, Corporate Sustainability strategies come with the risk of being decoupled from organizational practices. This article addresses this inconsistency by examining how Corporate Sustainability strategies are transformed into organizational work practices in the hospitality sector, where waste generation and the consumption of water and energy are major environmental liabilities. This paper is based on a micro-level inquiry into three Danish hotels in which the translation perspective in organizational research is adopted to analyze how both managers and front-line employees engage in translation work. Two modes of organizational translation are distinguished: first, high-mode translation, signifying upper management's transformation of ideas about sustainability into strategies, standards and new labels in order to signal uniqueness; and secondly, operational-mode translation, where lower-level managers and front-line employees (a) adapt and appropriate sustainability strategies designed by top management, and (b) themselves engage as employees in bottom up-driven sustainability translation. This study offers new insights into the micro-level translation of Corporate Sustainability, complementing the strategic perspective that has hitherto dominated research into Corporate Sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corporate sustainability; Denmark; Environmental sustainability active translators; Hospitality; Sustainability practices; Translation","Human resource management; Managers; Translation (languages); Corporate-sustainability; Denmark; Environmental sustainability; Hospitality; Sustainability practices; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071890307

At the end, they go to their laboratory to update the patients' health records. In addition to scheduling and routing of the caregivers, there are some other optimization decisions which can increase the competitive advantages of HHC organizations as a supply chain network. The location decisions of the pharmacies and laboratories and the assignment of patients to the nearest pharmacies are two of the several important logistics factors for an HHC organization. The literature shows that the green emissions and sustainability achievements for HHC logistics are still scarce. To cover more logistics and sustainability factors and make the HHC more practical, this study contributes a Green Home Health Care Supply Chain (GHHCSC) for the first time by a bi-objective location-allocation-routing model. Already applied successfully to this research area, the Simulated Annealing (SA) is also employed in this study. Another main innovation of this paper is to propose a set of new modified SA algorithms to better solve the proposed NP-hard problem. As a bi-objective optimization model, the epsilon constraint method is also utilized to check the algorithms’ results in small sizes. By using some multi-objective assessment metrics, the algorithms are compared with each other and their performance is evaluated. As such, some sensitivity analyses are performed to reveal the efficiency of the developed model. Finally, some managerial insights are deployed to achieve the sustainability for the HHC organizations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Green emissions; Home health care supply chain; Location-allocation-routing model; Modified simulated annealing algorithms; Sustainability","Competition; Computational complexity; Location; Sensitivity analysis; Simulated annealing; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bi-objective optimization; Competitive advantage; Epsilon-constraint method; Green emissions; Routing model; Scheduling and routing; Simulated annealing algorithms; Supply chain network; Home health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071639294

Meanwhile, local authorities in these countries often lack the human resource with the requisite technical capacity to analyse situations and recommend appropriate solutions. This calls for guidance in the most crucial technical decisions that affect the safe usage and environmental sustainability of on-site sanitation technologies.

Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth multiple-case study of four purposefully selected departments from four different hospitals is conducted. The selected cases had actively developed and embedded scheduled meetings as structural means to achieve coordination of daily operations. Findings: Health care professionals and managers, next to their traditional mono-professional meetings (e.g. doctors or nurses), develop additional operational, daily meetings such as work-shift meetings, huddles and hand-off meetings to solve concrete care tasks. These new types of meetings are typically short, task focussed, led by a chair and often inter-disciplinary. The meetings secure a personal proximity which the increased dependency on hospital-wide IT solutions cannot. During meetings, objects and representations (e.g. monitors, whiteboards or paper cards) create a needed gathering point to span across boundaries. As regards embedding meetings, local engagement helps contextualizing meetings and solving concrete care tasks, thereby making health care professionals more likely to value these daily meeting spaces. Practical implications: Health care professionals and managers can use formal meeting spaces aided by objects and representations to support solving daily and interdependent health care tasks in ways that IT solutions in hospitals do not offer today. Implementation requires local engagement and contextualization. Originality/value: This research paper shows the importance of daily, operational hospital meetings for frontline coordination. Organizational meetings are a prevalent collaborative activity, yet scarcely researched organizational phenomenon. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Coordination; Hospitals; Implementation; Meetings","article; doctor nurse relation; embedding; human; manager",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075622650

The study is positioned within critical hermeneutics; thus, a hermeneutic review strategy is applied and the subsequent critical discussion is inspired by a Habermasian understanding of society as composed of a system and lifeworld. The findings of the study are twofold; they reveal how different underlying assumptions frame the perception of the unit of analysis when focusing on value co-creation and how that the relocation of the locus of value creation from the company to the customer sphere hides that value is an economic concept in service marketing research. Moreover, the analysis reveals that in services market research, the concept of value co-creation in a company is applied to analyze the customer domain. This dimension has not received much academic attention despite that the existing concept might be applicable neither analytically nor empirically. Extant literature on value co-creation acknowledges that the meaning of the concept is still obscure. The present study therefore contributes to literature with a refined conceptual understanding of how the underlying perceptions of the concept lead to different analytical foci in existing research and by identifying questions for further research. Moreover, the review and the discussion are based within a hermeneutic paradigm and contribute as such with a rarely applied review methodology within the field of service marketing. © 2019 KeAi Communications Co., Ltd","Critical hermeneutics; Customer dominant logic; Service dominant logic; Service logic; Value co-creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100809823

We argue that purpose-driven behaviour among medical doctors serves as a counterforce to brain drain, fostering human stickiness in a developing country context. A sense of purpose provides a novel lens to understand voluntary non-migration of highly-skilled professionals under extreme conditions. Furthermore, incoming expatriate doctors build local capacity by sharing skills and expertise with Tanzanian doctors. This affects the medical doctors’ motives to migrate, further reducing brain drain. These individual-level decisions not to migrate find their application in policy. We advocate policies that support purpose-driven behaviour and generate long-term commitment to a location, while advancing short-term mobility for knowledge sharing. The policy initiatives are targeted at actors in the sending and receiving countries as well as in international organisations, covering concerted multi-layered policies to support family and community embeddedness, to facilitate the incoming of expatriate doctors and foreign exchange, and to cultivate benefits of circular migration. We argue that migration behaviour is more individually grounded and socio-emotionally constructed than what dominant economic-based explanations suggest. © 2019, The Author(s).","brain drain; faith; medical doctors; migration policy; purpose; stickiness; Tanzania",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093091006

Organizational design has traditionally been concerned with how top management designs organizations, and little is known about the role of middle managers in organizational design. Based on a case study of a reorganization in a leading food production company, this paper contributes to existing research on organizational design by advancing the knowledge of the role of middle managers in organizational design. It contributes to an understanding of organizational design as an iterative process that require active involvement of middle managers in designing micro dimensions of a macro design. In doing so, I provide an extension of prior work, which mainly focuses on vertical interactions and middle managers’ efforts to implement the intent of top management. I introduce a new middle manager role, designing, that relies on lateral rather than vertical coordination and interaction. I show how this role creates micro-level organizational elements needed to realize the intent behind top management’s strategy and make the macro structural arrangements work. These findings elevate the importance of middle managers in new forms of organizing. © 2019, The Author(s).","Macro design; Micro design; Middle manager strategic influence; Organizational design; Reorganization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089598334

Why the weekend effect exists remains unclear. Based on an ethnographic field study conducted in an emergency department and by applying an information processing perspective, my findings indicate multiple changes in the organizational design that leads to substantial misfits which appears to be an explanation to why the quality of care provided by the emergency department differs on weekdays and weekends. The findings provide a new and more nuanced perspective on the causes of the weekend effect by investigating the setting in which patient care is delivered, and how it varies between weekdays and weekends. © 2019, The Author(s).","Hospital emergency department; Information processing perspective; Organizational design; Organizational fits and misfits; Weekend effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089583555

Accurate measurements of the frequency response can be used as an intermediate step towards a parametric transfer function model, or provide an effective mechanism for model validation. This paper concerns several aspects of nonparametric frequency domain identification. We review developments in frequency response estimation for a class of linear or weakly nonlinear systems. We examine some properties of the associated confidence bounds. We describe an approach to localize resonant behavior without estimating a parametric model first, and demonstrate its use on experimental data of a steel beam. As models become more complex and diverse in response to the challenges of modern control strategies there will be an increasing need for a greater range of model validation procedures. We draw attention to the appearance of multiple testing problems in system identification, propose one method and contrast with another approach found in the statistics literature. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Dynamical systems; Frequency response; Uncertainty analysis; Frequency response estimation; Frequency response functions; Frequency-domain identification; Multiple testing problems; Non-parametric estimates; Nonparametric frequency domain identification; Transfer function model; Weakly nonlinear systems; Frequency estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087774854

The size of these benefits is also related to the maturity of the organization with regards to configuration lifecycle management. Therefore, this paper examines an operational approach to assess the level of configuration lifecycle maturity. The focus is on how to guide manufacturing companies to achieve the full potentials from operating configurators across all lifecycle phases of their products. Furthermore, how to assess and improve the utilization of configurators across all product's lifecycle phases within manufacturing companies will be elaborated.

Thus far, the literature on IT-enabled idea competitions has focused mainly on engaging external actors; consequently, we know less about the internal engagement of employees. Moreover, although the literature reveals several challenges in managing internal IT-enabled idea competitions, there are no comprehensive empirical accounts of how these challenges manifest in organizational contexts. Against this backdrop, we investigate how an engineering consultancy adapted an IT-enabled idea competition to support innovation, innovation awareness and knowledge sharing. This descriptive case study provides a detailed analysis of the breakdowns that manifested, what triggered the breakdowns, and how the organization responded. Our analysis reveals that the system required substantial adaptation, and, although it addressed well-known challenges in managing idea competitions, other challenges surfaced. We combine these empirical insights with extant literature to propose a model for understanding and explaining how our case organization handled the breakdowns that occurred while implementing the idea competition system. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076584786

Monitoring the agents’ efforts is costly. Therefore the principal rewards the agents based on their (noisy) relative outputs. This study addresses the question of whether the principal should evaluate the outputs of each task separately and award two winner prizes, one for each task, or whether it is better to award only one winner prize to the agent who performs the best over the two tasks. There are two countervailing effects. First, there is a prize-diluting effect, because for a given budget, the prizes will be smaller when there are two winner prizes than when there is only one winner prize. The prize-diluting effect reduces the agents’ incentives to invest their effort when there are two winner prizes. Second, there is a noise effect because the noisiness of the evaluation is reduced when there are two winner prizes. The main contribution of this study is to show that the prize-diluting effect dominates the noise effect. Hence, in general, principals will award prizes for combined tasks, and not for separate tasks. Several extensions are considered to test the robustness of this dominance result. © 2019","Contests; Head starts; Log-concavity; Multi-task environments; Tournaments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075776379

Such automation of human tasks and decision making can of course be beneficial through saving human resources, and through (ideally) leading to better solutions and decisions. However, to guarantee better decisions, the current AI techniques still have some way to go in most areas, and many of the techniques also suffer from weaknesses such as lack of transparency and explainability. The goal of the paper is not to argue against using any kind of AI in organisational decision making. AI techniques have a lot to offer, and can for instance assess a lot more possible decisions—and much faster—than any human can. The purpose is just to point to the weaknesses that AI techniques still have, and that one should be aware of when considering to implement AI to automate human decisions. Significant current AI research goes into reducing its limitations and weaknesses, but this is likely to become a fairly long-term effort. People and organisations might be tempted to fully automate certain crucial aspects of decision making without waiting for these limitations and weaknesses to be reduced—or, even worse, not even being aware of those weaknesses and what is lost in the automatisation process. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Algorithmic bias; Algorithmic decision making; Artificial intelligence (AI); Connectionist AI; Explainability; Human decision making; Symbolic AI; Trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075380361

This study bridges this gap through a four-level conceptual model of the role of uncertainty avoidance in the formation of employees’ intrapreneurial intentions, differentiating among unit- and country-level uncertainty avoidance. Using the established relationship between behavioral control and intentions, we consider how employee creativity and self-efficacy influence intrapreneurial intentions. Following the person-environment fit paradigm and the resulting fit traditions of complementarity and supplementarity, we narrow in on how these processes operate within specific (stimulating or inhibiting) cultural settings in terms of uncertainty avoidance at both the unit and country levels. Using data from 787 employees on the first level nested into 73 units on the second level, 19 organizations on the third level, and eight countries on the fourth level, study shows evidence for a beneficial interplay between unit-level uncertainty avoidance and creativity or self-efficacy when there is a supplementary or complementarity fit. The interplay between behavioral and contextual factors is negative, however, when neither type of fit applies. Finally, country-level uncertainty avoidance seems to be irrelevant to intrapreneurial intentions. © The Author(s) 2019.","creativity; intrapreneurial intentions; national culture; self-efficacy; uncertainty avoidance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075373170

I suggest and investigate different organizational characteristics as contextual factors. I find that executive turnover reduces future sales and employment growth, and show that three organizational characteristics (the firm's age, top management tenure, and employee tenure) moderate this effect. These results contribute to our understanding of the role of context in moderating executive turnover. Previous studies that examined the performance effects of executive turnover have often struggled to prove the causality between this event and a firms' post-turnover performance conclusively. The problem is that executive turnover is often correlated with a firm's current performance and expected future challenges. I address this endogeneity problem by exploiting the exogenous variation in firms' performances following 516 top managers' unexpected deaths. I use a matched sample to investigate which organizational characteristics that mitigate the negative effect on the firms' subsequent performances resulting from these executive turnovers. I obtained this sample randomly from a comprehensive dataset containing yearly observations of all Danish firms from 1995 to 2007. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Context-emergent turnover (CET); Employee tenure; Executive turnover; Organizational change and performance; Organizational disruption; TMT tenure; Top management succession",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075197477

However, the necessary precision needed to exploit the advantages of process simulation is challenging the software simulation technology. High accuracy μIM process control is a key aspect when performing micro molding simulations. Hence, data analysis and simulations of μIM experiments have been conducted. Micro molding simulations have been executed by implementing in the software the actual processing conditions. Various aspects of the simulation set-up have been considered in order to improve the simulation accuracy (i.e. to decrease deviations from experimental values): injection speed profile, pressure at injection location, melt and mold temperatures, three-dimensional mesh parameters, and material rheological characterization. Quality factors investigated for the quantitative comparisons were: short shot length, injection pressure profile, molding mass and flow pattern. Inconsistencies and uncertainties in the experimental data must be minimized to avoid introducing uncertainties in the simulation calculations. In this work, simulations of bulky sub-100 mg micro molded parts have been validated.

While affect theoretical approaches often emphasize precognitive intensities and their transformative potential, the novel foregrounds how affective intensities stay and stick as they are entangled with powerful socio-political conventions, such as investments in the American Dream or the idea of stable employment.

Managers in thrall to the digital language of control accessible via IT can use it to create operational paths that crowd out the free cognitive conceptual habitus of the university scholars.

Although the importance of a long-term vision and planning is widely acknowledged, the idea to speed up the energy transition with binding targets and timetables has also been criticised. Instead, societal transformations are created by the messy combination of actors and networks, stories and visions, regulations, agreements, local and regional initiatives, etc. Yet, there is still a lack of systematic analyses of how futures become mainstream in policy and practice. This article analyzes the context and actors in which the Danish energy transition emerges. We describe this process as materialization, referring to the process in which different representations of a future come together and incrementally organize the future. Although the Danish energy case has been analyzed by many authors over the last years, most analyses of the Danish energy transition are done from an institutional perspective. The importance of stories (about the future) has been mentioned as an important factor, but it has not been the focus of research. This research combines a discursive dimension with an institutional perspective to analyze how the future of renewable energy materialized and consolidated in Denmark. The case not only shows different phases of materialization, it also shows that different combinations of the interplay between actors, context and stories led to materialization and consolidation of the energy transition in Denmark. © 2019","Consolidation; Future frames; Green energy transation Denmark; Materialisation; Stories about the future","alternative energy; energy policy; energy resource; institutional framework; renewable resource; research work; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073523184

However, results on the PSM–absenteeism association are inconclusive. One reason could be that PSM increases presenteeism (going to work even when ill), which in turn increases absenteeism and counteracts—or even exceeds—PSM-based reductions of absenteeism. Based on a three-wave panel study of Danish public and private sector employees, we find a strong positive association between PSM and presenteeism and indications that the PSM–absenteeism link is mediated by presenteeism. The findings suggest that going to work even on days when employees feel ill is a potential dark side of PSM and that it may have long-term consequences for the extent to which employees are absent from their jobs due to sickness. This cautions managers not to expect that high PSM automatically guarantees high performance and low absence. © The Author(s) 2017.","panel data; presenteeism; public service motivation; sickness absenteeism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073015700

Further, despite the known benefits of innovation, not all innovations are adopted and the ones that are do not always have a successful outcome. Through a qualitative case study of the US aerial adventure industry, this paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages innovation may have on operational risk management as well as understanding why seemingly critical innovations are not adopted. Unlike tourism in general, the industry is relying heavily on radical innovations as it continues to grow. Numerous benefits are highlighted, yet also indicate a resistance to adopt innovations. The study demonstrates how adventure tourism, in its adaption and managerial processes, seeks balance by using well-tested safety technologies and measures against the incentive to enhance such thrill effects that will appeal to customer. Management implications: • This paper documents the advantages and disadvantages of innovation within adventure tourism, in particular the US aerial adventure industry, and it demonstrates the managerial ambiguities. • The paper finds that whilst innovations have had positive implications upon the industry, they have also led to further challenges in terms of changes in competitions. • The adventure tourism industry seeks to balance its cycles of innovation, and safety is a contributing factor that stimulates innovative activity, alongside the concern for customer thrill experiences. © 2019","Adventure tourism; Aerial adventures; Innovation; Operations risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072278437

The presented and applied model is pertinent to the theory-oriented evaluation tradition using a logic frame and a theory of change approach adapted to the special requirements of ex-ante evaluation. The model is illustrated by the case study of a program for the promotion of women entrepreneurship in the STEM fields.

Using the resource dependence and agency views, this paper examines how business group affiliation influences the relationship between board diversity and firm performance as a contextual/confounding factor. Based on data for listed firms in India, we find that board demographic diversity is positively associated with the firm performance (Tobin's Q) of standalone firms, but this association is negative for group-affiliated firms. This negative effect of group affiliation is confirmed in a test based on a novel measure of firm performance using the stock market reaction to the announcement of mergers and acquisitions. For both measures of performance, we show that business group affiliation impairs the positive firm value effects of board demographic diversity. These findings imply that the relationship between board diversity and firm performance requires re-examination in the many countries where group affiliation is common. Our results also provide evidence of a new cost of group affiliation and show in a fresh context that cross-country studies should account for international variations in ownership and institutional structures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Board diversity; Business groups; Corporate governance; India; Institutional structure; Mergers and acquisitions (M&A)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072153789

In light of recent developments in the workplace and the external environment, the question of what PSM competencies are needed now, as well as in the future, becomes one of increasing importance. Analysing qualitative data from 46 interviews from 16 companies, this paper identifies what current and future competencies are required by PSM professionals, categorizes PSM competencies according to the framework established by Tassabehji and Moorhouse (2008) and establishes how these competency requirements have changed over the last ten years. The most important current competencies required by PSM professionals are negotiation, communication and relationship management (e.g. ‘Interpersonal communication’), strategy and analytics (e.g. ‘Strategic thinking’), as well as professional knowledge requirements (e.g. ‘Basic knowledge on PSM role & processes’). When looking at future requirements, competencies in the areas of sustainability and digitisation were identified as becoming increasingly important. Overall, 17 competencies in addition to those shown in Tassabehji and Moorhouse (2008) were identified. The most prominent new competency areas are related to digitisation (e.g. ‘eProcurement Technology’, ‘Automation’), innovation (e.g. ‘Innovative sourcing’) and sustainability. The interviewees also identified 11 new competencies within the interpersonal skills cluster, most of them at the intersection between competencies and traits (e.g. ‘Deal with Ambiguity’, ‘Curiosity’, ‘Passion’). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Current and future competencies; Interviews; Procurement; Purchasing and supply management; Skills",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071876110

This study explores how the presence of the digital platform manifests itself in workers’ perceptions of their work in the context of ride-hailing. We draw on the literature on work relations and theorize how the dimensions of work relations manifest themselves in work done for a digital platform. We employ the Gioia method to analyze 39 interviews conducted with Uber and Lyft drivers, and we identify six key mechanisms of platform-enabled work, namely self-employment, time management, income, information control, pricing, and rating. Our results illustrate that from workers’ perspective, flexibility in work relationships is a key positive element of platform-enabled work. The stark power disparity between workers and the platform is, in turn, a major source of discontent among workers. As a result, we put forward two key dimensions of work relations in the context of platform-enabled work: digital temporality and algorithmic administrativity. The study furthers understanding of the implications from the platform economy and sharing economy on work relations. © 2019","Digital platform; Digitalization; Gig economy; Lyft; Platform economy; Ride-hailing; Sharing economy; Taxi; Uber; Work","Taxicabs; Digital platforms; Digitalization; Gig economy; Lyft; Platform economy; Ride-hailing; Sharing economy; Taxi; Uber; Work; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071386088

Firstly, the aim was to explore if involving 39 local fifth-grade children (10–11 years old) from a deprived neighbourhood in creating playable installations in a public open space influenced their use of this space. Secondly, we wanted to explore if the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework (RE-AIM) was useful for evaluating different stages in the intervention project. RE-AIM was applied through a convergent mixed-methods triangulation design using survey, accelerometer, GPS, and interviews as data sources. Effectiveness outcomes revealed that on average the space was used less by the 39 children after the intervention. The implementation and maintenance dimensions revealed aspects of why most children involved in the project did not use the space after intervention. The evaluation cast light on children's perceptions of their role, and importance of maintenance when the intervention was completed.

This electricity storage system produces heat as it charges and cogenerates cold and power when discharging. Therefore, it is most appropriate for locations with district heating and cooling systems besides electricity grids. Although subcooled compressed air energy storage system offers the high overall coefficient of performance of about 1.5 in a full round-trip operation, the power-to-power efficiency of this system is far lower than that of the advanced isentropic compressed air system. Considering the facts that the electricity sector is extremely more important than other energy sectors in the future energy systems, this study proposes the combination of a subcooled energy storage unit with an Organic Rankine Cycle for improving the electricity efficiency of this compressed air concept. The proposed hybrid system is thermodynamically analyzed and the exergetic and energetic performances of the system under uniform and fluctuating operation conditions are evaluated. The results show that not only this hybridization leads to enhanced electricity and cold efficiencies by around 20% each, but also the heat production does not fall significantly owing to the heat supply potential of the Organic Rankine Cycle condenser.

For example, uncertainty of market prices in energy markets with capitalist characteristics can negatively affect decisions of aggregators participating in such markets to make profits. In fact, uncertainty in capitalist energy markets should be controlled since many individuals who participate in such markets have specific expectations (economic goals in most cases) and this may result in some concerns over the future performances of mentioned markets under uncertainty. It should be noted that aggregator can be a person or an authority who is responsible for a group of energy consumers/resources like electric vehicles (EVs) and seeks to participate in energy markets in order to get to some expected goals that can be economical, technical and etc. Moreover, attitude to risk of a decision-maker can change in different working conditions which needs to be considered through various decision-making criteria. In this paper, robust performance (optimal/stable operation against the worst possible condition of uncertainty) of an EV aggregator against the uncertainty of market price is studied by incorporating robust optimization method. The aggregator willing to participate in energy market can benefit from the provided strategies created by this optimization model to satisfy the expected economic goals and control the uncertainty of energy market. In detail, specific plans and strategies are determined toward possible values of uncertain market price that satisfy economic goals of aggregator and keep the uncertainty under control. Mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) is used to model the problem which is solved in general algebraic modeling system (GAMS) software. A microgrid system composed of distributed generation units (local generation units that can be either renewable or non-renewable) including dispatchable and non-dispatchable ones, EVs and storage system is studied, and the results are presented.

However, little is known about how companies consider moral objectives for their research and development (R&D) activities, or the basis upon which these activities are chosen. This research involves qualitative investigation into Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry, comprising 30 in-depth, pan-European interviews with key personnel in the industry, and focus groups with employees at 14 different companies. Through investigation of the ‘responsible’ activities these companies currently undertake, we shed light on the types of moral goals they set and their underlying ethical standpoints. By reviewing both the responsible innovation and sustainability discourses, and presenting phenomenological evidence, we demonstrate that companies have adopted some aspects of RRI, even though it might not be recognised as such. Our findings indicate that these innovators recognise some of the ethical and societal concerns associated with their activities but their approach is often piecemeal; primary focus is upon the most immediate issues and on legal compliance, to the detriment of broader societal issues and wider challenges. We recommend explicit mechanisms that draw upon established ethical thought and practical academic work to improve companies' abilities to carry out their sustainability activities, and incorporate them into a responsible business strategy. We conclude with recommendations for innovators, corporate research and development, and policy. © 2019","Ethics; ICT; Research and development; Responsible research and innovation; Sustainability","Personnel; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Corporate research; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Ethical considerations; Ethics; Information and Communication Technologies; Innovation approach; Research and development; Societal concerns; Philosophical aspects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070978260

First, based on a literature overview, key circular product characteristics are identified, namely modularity and robustness. Then, a survey has been distributed to practicing mechatronic engineers. Based on the survey, it is found that mechatronic systems are currently designed for long-term circular strategies, while the end-of-life is rarely considered. Furthermore, it is found that one issue in designing mechatronic devices is that they are prone to electronics obsolescence, and that safety regulations may prevent to design for circularity. Moreover, it is reported that customers do not currently require circular aspects in the mechatronic products and thus there is no incentive to designs according to circular principles. Finally, the paper discusses on new research ways of improving the circularity aspect of mechatronic devices, such as by facilitating remanufacturing or by using distributed system. © 2019","Circular economy; Engineering design; Mechatronics","Mechatronics; Obsolescence; Surveys; Circular economy; Circular strategies; Distributed systems; Engineering design; Exploratory research; Mechatronic devices; Mechatronic products; Product characteristics; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070920338

The article elaborates on the concept of service for the circular economy, partly through a literature study, which argues for an extension of the understanding of the roles of services in the circular economy. This involves services aimed at the consumer's person in addition to recirculating consumer waste products. The second part of the study takes the first steps to building a typology for understanding value creation processes in the circular economy. Here, it is argued that the success of advancing services in the circular economy hinges not only on providing value-in-use, but equally so on the ability to provide contextual value that supports consumers' identity and role enactment. Furthermore, cases are used to illustrate and exemplify practical ways to further deepening the service engagement in the circular economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Consumers; Contextual value; Service systems; Service valorization; Typology","Production engineering; Circular economy; Consumers; Contextual value; Service systems; Service valorization; Typology; Industrial engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070895512

We begin to unpack the role of unemployment duration in necessity entrepreneurship by asking how it affects one of the most fundamental decisions in start-ups: “what business should I be in?” Analyzing primary data on 576 necessity entrepreneurs combined with three secondary data sets, we find that unemployment duration affects whether ventures are launched in “home” or in external industries, and moderates the extent to which founders' industry experience and the attractiveness of external opportunities relative to those in the “home” industry shape industry choice. Managerial Summary: Necessity entrepreneurs—individuals who create new firms because they have no other options for work—represent a substantial proportion of world-wide entrepreneurial activity, and, in developed countries, often come from the ranks of the unemployed. We analyze these entrepreneurs by answering the question “what business should I be in?,” a fundamental strategic decision that founders make. Our findings reveal that duration in unemployment is a key, hitherto unexamined factor that systematically affects the industry-choice decision in startups. Moreover, we find that duration of unemployment moderates the founder's industry experience and the attractiveness of external opportunities relative to those in the “home” industry, with a markedly different picture for the long-term unemployed—suggesting the need for customized government policies for formerly unemployed entrepreneurs. © 2019 The Authors.

Although the literature discusses collaborative challenges, issues related to resistance are largely unexplored and mostly regarded as destructive. However, we argue for understanding resistance more dynamically – as a co-constructive aspect of collaboration. Drawing on extant resistance studies, we combine concepts of meaning negotiation and counter-narrative to examine power-resistance relations in a case study of collaborative forms of governance in the Danish education sector. The findings elucidate how resistance complicates, yet also co-constructs collaboration in governance processes; discursive struggles over meanings of collaboration and a quality model invoke power-resistance relations that destabilize a dominant narrative and enable counter-narratives, which influence future collaborative processes. Hence, we suggest understanding resistance as a constitutive feature in collaborative forms of governance, rather than a destructive obstacle. This contributes with empirical and theoretical insights into the complex role of resistance in collaboration and governance processes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative governance; Counter-narrative; Education sector; Meaning negotiation; Organizational discourse; Resistance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070271138

The study finds that the linkages between three innovation-related dynamic capabilities (innovativeness, supply-chain agility, and adaptability) and international performance are positively and negatively moderated by institutional development and institutional distance, but that their influences are opposite.

Such models have recently appeared in the literature, but parameters were often defined ad-hoc or without documentation. This paper presents approaches to derive important parameters for such models based on commonly available data. We apply logit regression models considering four high-level characteristics of the urban landscape (distance from main station, accessibility to motorway, accessibility to marine and green spaces) to predict location of urban development for different building types, estimate characteristic building footprint and floor space areas for different building types depending on their location in the city, derive building coverage ratios using Voronoi polygons and estimate the number of buildings in new developments using hierarchical clustering. The applicability of all methods is demonstrated in a case study in Odense, Denmark. The derived parameters are case-specific, while the methods can easily be transferred to different case studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building density; Exploratory modelling; Location choice; Urban development size; Urban hydrology","building; cluster analysis; data set; greenspace; infrastructural development; landscape structure; urban development; Denmark; Fyn; Odense; Syddanmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067864858

This study uses the most widely adopted definition and operationalization of control in IJVs by Geringer and Hebert (1989), including the three dimensions: mechanisms, focus, and extent of control. These relationships are further analyzed by integrating internal and external moderating factors and their connections with IJV performance. Our theoretical analysis proposes that various control strategies differently influence an IJV's innovation activities under various internal environmental moderating factors. These, in turn, differently influence the IJV performance. Furthermore, we suggest that the external environmental factors moderate the relationship between innovation strategies and performance of IJVs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Control strategies; Incremental and radical innovation; International joint ventures; Performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067560260

We study how two strategic options emerged and were valued differently in a protracted case regarding sourcing by the Danish Defence Force. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory we show how the two strategic options emerged and were pitted against each other in what Callon describes as ‘trials of strength’. The contribution of the paper is in three actions: First, it develops the concept of ‘trial of strength’ for accounting and organizational research by showing that extant literature can be enhanced with the conceptualization of a typology of trials that distinguishes between prototype trials and trials of incompatibility. Second, it shows that accounting inscriptions may play changing roles which we label ‘versatile’ when forged in the contested circumstances and resultant pressure of a trial of incompatibility. Third, it highlights how accounting inscriptions take part in (re)formulating, evaluating and advancing mutually exclusive reform options in a series of trials of strength involving both a prototype trial and trials of incompatibility. In addition to the frequency, number and intensity of the inscriptions there appears to be an increased prospect of unfaithful behavior by some inscriptions.

Supporting conventional wisdom, entrepreneurs report a stronger Faith in Intuition than others. Their actual choices are partly in line with this: entrepreneurs make indeed more intuitive choices than managers, but are equally intuitive as employees. At the same time, entrepreneurs have response times and a self-reported Need for Cognition that exceeds those of employees. Together, these findings tentatively suggest that entrepreneurs start from a stronger predisposition to choose the intuitive action, but share with managers that they take more time to think things over and thereby are more inclined to move away from their instant intuitive choice. © 2018, The Author(s).","Contemplativeness; Entrepreneurs; Faith in Intuition; Lab-in-the-field experiment; Need for Cognition; Response times",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056663027

Unlike conventional approaches that focus only on armed conflict and treat all other cases as ""at peace"", we first distinguish cases with and without contested incompatibilities (Stage 1) and then whether or not contested incompatibilities escalate to armed conflict (Stage 2). This allows us to analyze factors that relate to conflict origination (onset of incompatibilities) and factors that predict conflict militarization (onset of armed violence). Using new data on incompatibilities and armed conflict, we replicate and extend three prior studies of violent civil conflict, reformulated as a two-stage process, considering different estimation procedures and potential selection problems. We find that the group-based horizontal political inequalities highlighted in research on violent civil conflict clearly relate to conflict origination but have no clear association with militarization, whereas other features emphasized as shaping the risk of civil war, such as refugee flows and soft state power, predict militarization but not incompatibilities. A two-stage approach to conflict analysis can help advance theories of civil conflict, assess alternative mechanisms through which explanatory variables are thought to influence conflict, and guide new data-collection efforts. © 2018 The IO Foundation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053191234

The papers identify challenges for evaluation by highlighting the variety of approaches towards cluster policies addressed at different policy levels. Additional challenges for an identification of policy impact result from the complexity as well as the timing of policy effects. Thus, proper evaluations should employ and combine a broad set of evaluation methods.

The empirical analysis is based on original data that was collected in fall 2011 and late summer 2013 with cluster actors (firms and public research organizations) who received government funding. Our results show that over time the program was effective in initiating new cooperation between cluster actors and in intensifying existing linkages. A substantial share of the newly formed linkages is among actors who did not receive direct funding for a joint R&D project, which indicates a mobilization effect. Furthermore, we observe differential developments regarding clusters’ spatial embeddedness. Some clusters tend to increase their localization, whereas others increase their connectivity to international partners.

A cluster is ambidextrous if it manages to balance innovative activities that exploit existing competencies and is open to novel technological approaches by means of exploration. In this context, we are interested in the supportive role of cluster management, assuming that a cluster organization can only persist sustainably if exploitation and exploration are pursued in an appropriate balance. Our analysis is based on surveys conducted between 2011 and 2012 with ten cluster managements and their respective cluster firms of the first two waves of the German Leading Edge Cluster Competition. Our results indicate that the demand for services offered by the cluster management depends on companies’ strategies with respect to exploration, exploitation, and ambidexterity. In turn, the priorities set by the cluster management can be explained by the firms’ needs. Accordingly, we argue that cluster management acts as a service provider, helping the cluster companies to become ambidextrous which, in turn, makes the cluster as a whole ambidextrous. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Ambidexterity; Cluster; Cluster management; Exploitation; Exploration","Natural resources exploration; Technology transfer; Ambidexterity; Cluster; Cluster management; Cluster organizations; Exploitation; Exploitation and explorations; Exploration and exploitation; Inter-organizational process; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027024295

While there is ample empirical evidence on the constituent force of co-location for the formation of research alliances, little attention has been paid to the actual consequences of geographical concentration of alliance partners for the subsequent performance of these linkages. In this paper, we address this underexplored issue and aim to complement the rare examples of studies on the relevance of geographical proximity for research outputs. We utilize original and unique survey data from collaborative R&D projects that were funded within the “Leading-Edge Cluster Competition” (LECC)—the main national cluster funding program in Germany in recent years. We find that the perception of the necessity of geographical proximity for project success is rather heterogeneous among the respondents of the funded projects. Moreover, the relationship between geographical distance and project success is by no means univocal and is mediated by various technological, organizational and institutional aspects. Our findings strongly support the assumption that the nature of knowledge involved determines the degree to which collaborators are reliant on being closely located to each other. The relevance of geographical proximity increases in exploration contexts when knowledge is novel and the innovation endeavor is more radical, while this effect is less pronounced for projects with a stronger focus on basic research. Moreover, geographical proximity and project satisfaction foster cross-fertilization effects of LECC projects. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Geographical proximity; Innovation policy; Project performance; Research collaboration","Cross fertilization; Geographical proximity; Innovation policies; Institutional aspects; New economic geographies; Project performance; Regional networks; Research collaborations; Technology transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023191521

A literature search resulted in the selection of 74 articles, published between 1990 and 2016, which focus on E-L interactions that influence the success of an organisation. The overview shows most of the research has been done at the individual level of analysis, examining the impact of contact with HCNs on expatriate adjustment and performance. Several avenues and suggestions for future research are listed; an important starting point for future research is to clearly delineate which aspect of expatriate-local interactions is investigated–the frequency, depth, or breadth of the contact. This review counterbalances the predominant IHRM focus on expatriates as sole actors in expatriate success by specifically including another important stakeholder, the HCN.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the university–industry collaboration (UIC) drivers from the industry side. It analyses how, and to what extent, policy interventions could increase the engagement of industry actors in UICs. Design/methodology/approach: An experimental research design has been used involving a feasibility and pilot study (January to June 2018) with 36 firms, in a non-urban region context, with a satellite university campus. The pilot study explores a randomised control trial (RCT) design, with a training intervention to a randomized group of participants in the pilot study. Findings: Firms involved in universities’ students (academic forms of UICs) might not necessarily consider the university as a research partner, even in a geographic proximity setting. In addition, there is a potential “dark-side” to proximity, when industry participants build their perceptions using second-hand experiences or indirect information. A training intervention facilitates to overcome pre-existing biases but does not trigger a substantial change in the UIC’s behaviour of the firms in the short-term. Research limitations/implications: The pilot study provides valuable insights for researchers interested in a larger RCT. It also provides insights for university managers who want to understand the motivations of industry participants in UICs. Originality/value: The experimental approach of the research generates evidence on the feasibility to intervene in the activation of UICs from an industry perspective, a central aspect in transition towards an entrepreneurial university model. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration; Entrepreneurial university; Pilot study; Randomized-control trial; University–industry",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067860069

Marketers strive to develop a unique value proposition to satisfy the needs of customers in order to create a differentiated offering to targeted customers, be they end consumers or business users. It is the unique value delivered by products and services that defines firm's competitive market positioning. Recent advances in marketing theory have enhanced the interpretation of value in terms of its types, manifestations and determinants. Value in marketing is delivered to customers, stakeholders, shareholders, ecosystems and society. While the literature has been unanimously emphasizing the economic interpretation of value, measured in money terms, marketing has been at the forefront of critical thinking bringing to the fore new meanings and interpretations of value that have unlocked the psychological, emotional, social and ecological value of products and services to customers. It is the marketing thought that has extended the understanding of value-in-use and has indisputably positioned value in context. Marketing has developed the notion of value delivered by intangible assets that can create much greater value than the tangible product and/or service. Marketing has unravelled the multi-layered nature of value to the customer and thus augmented the meanings and interpretations, as well as the analytical and practical potential of this notion. Consequently, we see the need to revisit the concept of value in marketing in order to address its complexity. This book sets to provide an insight in the concept of value in marketing in its contemporary interpretation and level of development. The aim is to offer an overview of debates and developments in our understanding of value in marketing that can raise the awareness of the scholarly and business communities of its pivotal importance for businesses and consumers. Value in Marketing presents reflections and analysis of value in marketing by consecutive generations of scholars who have made theoretical contribution to the contemporary understanding of the concept, its interpretations, dimensions and importance. The chapters address various issues including: customer value development, implications, and trajectories; intra-variable and inter-variable perspectives of value; the importance of the value concept in the international marketing context; value developed in networks that is intrinsically associated with knowledge creation in the internationalization, meanings and interpretations of value in diverse contexts that help us develop further the dimensions of the concept. We trust the book will be of interest to researchers, scholars and students in the fields of marketing management and international business, and to people who wish to have a better understand what marketing really brings to consumers. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of five volunteer engagement dimensions (cognitive, affective, behavioral, social and spiritual engagement) on perceived value-in-context, and its subsequent role for volunteer retention. Thus, providing for the first time an understanding of how unique types of value are determined through different facets of volunteer engagement. Design/methodology/approach: To establish the nature and consequences of volunteer engagement, the authors collaborated with an Australian not-for-profit service organization. Using a survey method, the authors studied the organization’s volunteer workforce resulting in 464 usable responses. To capture volunteers’ degree of spiritual engagement, this paper introduces a rigorously developed unidimensional measure. Findings: The results demonstrate the importance of the five engagement dimensions on volunteers’ perceived value-in-context, while highlighting significant effect differences including some counterintuitive consequences. The authors also establish the role of spiritual engagement and demonstrate the impact of value-in-context for volunteer retention. Originality/value: This research explores the volunteer engagement-retention chain, by empirically studying the role of value-in-context. The authors provide first evidence for the relationship between volunteer engagement and value-in-context, examining the independent yet relative effects of various facets of volunteer engagement. In doing so, the authors offer new insight into the dimensionality of the volunteer engagement construct, broadening its conceptualization to include spiritual engagement as a core constituent. The authors further demonstrate the impact of value-in-context on volunteer retention, helping organizations to better make sense of meaningful volunteer experiences with long-lasting impacts and mutual benefits. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Engagement; Not-for-profit; Spiritual engagement; Value; Volunteer; Volunteer engagement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074033218

In the charging mode, the system stores the surplus power of a renewable energy system in the form of compressed air in a cavern and generates much heat as well. In the discharging mode, when the renewable power plant demands extra electricity, the system reclaims the compressed air to be expanded through a specific type of turbine and thereby generates electricity as well as a large amount of cold. At nominal load, when all the components are working at their optimal states, a high coefficient of performance of about 1.5 has been achieved for the system over a complete charging-discharging round. This paper, however, investigates thermodynamically and environmentally the performance of this technology while working at off-design conditions. For this, realistic performance curves for various components of the system are employed and the system operation is simulated for various operational conditions. The results show that the storage unit is best to work on its highest possible charging-discharging loads; otherwise, the overall efficiency would fall remarkably. The trigeneration/storage system overall performance coefficient will decrease to 1.27% and 1.05% if the operational load drops to 50% and 10%, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Environmental analysis; Partial load operation; Performance curve; Subcooled compressed air energy storage; Trigeneration","Compressed air; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Pressure vessels; Renewable energy resources; Environmental analysis; Partial load; Performance curve; Subcooled; Tri-generation; Compressed air energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070514883

Based on a survey of around 600 biogas plant operators, the fractions of excess heat from the cogeneration units in these plants are analysed. A heuristic is developed to match biogas plants (heat sources) with local settlements (heat sinks) in order to determine a least-cost district heating supply for residential buildings. Two criteria are employed, namely the CO2 abatement costs and the payback period, which represent the macro- and microeconomic perspectives respectively. Based on the survey, the mean fraction of excess heat is 40%, which is in agreement with other empirical studies. Extrapolating this fraction to the German biogas plant stock, which is selected as a case study, leads to technically feasible CO2 savings of around 2.5 MtCO2/a. Employing the criteria of CO2 abatement costs and payback period yields about 2 MtCO2/a below CO2 abatement costs of 200 €/tCO2 and below a payback period of 9 years. This represents about 0.25% of the total German CO2 emissions in 2016 or around 2.5% of all CO2 in residential buildings. Alternative threshold values of 80 €/tCO2 and 5 years payback period reduce the carbon reduction potential to about 0.5 MtCO2 and 0.75 MtCO2 respectively. These relatively high average costs are related to the typically low population density in rural regions where biogas plants are located. These potentials are concentrated in around 3,500 of 11,400 municipalities, where district heating from biogas plants could reduce CO2 emissions per capita by an average of 250 kgCO2/a and cover 12% of the total heating demand. Apart from a methodology that can be transferred to any country with comparable data availability, the present study demonstrates that the use of excess heat in biogas plants can contribute to global decarbonisation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas plant; CO2 abatement costs; District heating; Energy autonomy; Excess heat","Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; District heating; Housing; Investments; Population statistics; Surveys; Biogas plants; Carbon reduction potentials; CO2 abatement; Energy autonomies; Excess heats; Population densities; Residential building; Technical potential; Biogas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070188355

The study also analyses the impact of customer involvement in sourcing decisions and project execution on project performance (PP) of ETO shipbuilding projects by considering project and customer characteristics. The contributions of this study to the current body of knowledge on customer involvement in ETO projects are twofold. First, it demonstrates that customer involvement at different stages of shipbuilding projects have differential impacts on PP. Customer involvement in sourcing decisions during the early stages of the project has a positive impact, whereas involvement in project execution during the later stages of the project has a negative impact on PP. Second, it reveals that project complexity and customer type together significantly affect the PP. Therefore, the role of project complexity and customer type as potential contingent factors in explaining PP is emphasised.

A conceptual framework is developed and typical sourcing strategies and business models for FM are investigated. Archetypical value chains are established by a combination of sourcing strategies and business models.

The automatic classification of corals species based on underwater images is important as it can help experts to track and detect threatened and vulnerable coral species. However, this classification is complicated due to the nature of coral underwater images and the fact that current underwater coral datasets are unrealistic as they contain only texture images, while the images taken by autonomous underwater vehicles show the complete coral structure. The objective of this paper is two-fold. The first is to build a dataset that is representative of the problem of classifying underwater coral images, the StructureRSMAS dataset. The second is to build a classifier capable of resolving the real problem of classifying corals, based either on texture or structure images. We have achieved this by using a two-level classifier composed of three ResNet models. The first level recognizes whether the input image is a texture or a structure image. Then, the second level identifies the coral species. To do this, we have used a known texture dataset, RSMAS, and StructureRSMAS. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional Neural Networks; Coral images classification; Deep learning; DenseNet; Inception; ResNet; Structure coral images","Autonomous underwater vehicles; Autonomous vehicles; Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Image texture; Neural networks; Textures; Convolutional neural network; DenseNet; Images classification; Inception; ResNet; Image classification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069960975

Findings: The results revealed that the level of awareness of standards is low and the compliance level is even lower at the same time as the data indicated a positive relation between awareness and compliance. Attending seminars, knowledge dissemination by extension agents, farmers’ awareness of the existence of other standards and health consciousness have a significant and positive influence on awareness of feed standards while the age of the farm and dependence on farm formulated feeds have a significant negative influence on awareness of standards. On the other hand; knowledge dissemination by TBS, awareness of chicken feed standards and awareness of the existence of other standards apart from chicken feed standards, have a significant positive influence on compliance with feed standards. Research limitations/implications: These findings indicate that regulators should invest more in awareness creation campaigns to enhance compliance with feed standards at the same time as feed processors should develop closer knowledge and learning links to farmers. Originality/value: The findings of the study are expected to positively contribute to performance of chicken industry in Tanzania by promoting production of products that are of quality accepted domestically and abroad. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Awareness; Chicken Tanzania; Compliance; Feed; Quality; Standards",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074045579

The present study therefore aimed to assess the environmental impact associated with dietary intake across four European countries, and to explain sources of variations in environmental impact by energy intake, demographics and diet composition. Individual-level dietary intake data were obtained from nationally-representative dietary surveys, by using two non-consecutive days of a 24-h recall or a diet record, from Denmark (DK, n = 1710), Czech Republic (CZ, n = 1666), Italy (IT, n = 2184), and France (FR, n = 2246). Dietary intake data were linked to a newly developed pan-European environmental sustainability indicator database that contains greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and land use (LU) values for ∼900 foods. To explain the variation in environmental impact of diets, multilevel regression models with random intercept and random slopes were fitted according to two levels: adults (level 1, n = 7806) and country (level 2, n = 4). In the models, diet-related GHGE or LU was the dependent variable, and the parameter of interest, i.e. either total energy intake or demographics or food groups, the exploratory variables. A 200-kcal higher total energy intake was associated with a 9% and a 10% higher daily GHGE and LU. Expressed per 2000 kcal, mean GHGE ranged from 4.4 (CZ) to 6.3 kgCO2eq/2000 kcal (FR), and LU ranged from 5.7 (CZ) to 8.0 m2*year/2000 kcal (FR). Dietary choices explained most of the variation between countries. A 5 energy percent (50 g/2000 kcal) higher meat intake was associated with a 10% and a 14% higher GHGE and LU density, with ruminant meat being the main contributor to environmental footprints. In conclusion, intake of energy, total meat and the proportion of ruminant meat explained most of the variation in GHGE and LU of European diets. Contributions of food groups to environmental footprints however varied between countries, suggesting that cultural preferences play an important role in environmental footprints of consumers. In particular, Findings from the present study will be relevant for national-specific food policy measures towards a more environmentally-friendly diet. © 2019","Dietary quality; Energy intake; Greenhouse gas emission; Land use; Sustainability","Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Meats; Nutrition; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Dependent variables; Energy intake; Environmental footprints; Environmental sustainability; European Countries; Individual levels; Regression model; Sources of variation; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070526608

Recent and on-going efforts to address excessive residential energy use have taken various forms and have been initiated by a range of different actors. This paper presents evidence from the analysis of a database of 249 recent sustainable energy initiatives that have been implemented at various scales in and across urban areas in Europe. The paper examines common trends and characteristics in the type of initiatives that are promoted, including the problem definition, general approach, and implementation method. A second focus of enquiry centers on the governance mechanisms that underpin these initiatives. Here, attention turns to the main actors responsible for driving initiatives, the frequency and various forms of implementing partnerships, and the funding source through which the selected initiatives are financed. Two major themes emerged from reviewing the data, namely stratification and integration. Stratification or integration was evident across five key areas including problem framing, general approach, engagement mechanisms, governance, and evaluation frameworks. A corresponding typology of initiatives is presented under four categories: Enhancing; Directional; Experimental; and Responsive. Applying the typology to the dataset shows that enhancing initiatives aimed at optimizing technology or individual behavior are most prevalent (56%). Experimental initiatives that deliberate with new ways of living (16%) or responsive initiatives that consider contextual-needs (14%) are less prevalent and are more likely to occur at a smaller scale. Overall, we argue that integration across key areas can increase the success of initiatives that aim to achieve long-term sustainable transformation in household energy use. © 2019 The Authors","Characteristics; Governance; Integration; Socio-technical; Sustainable energy; Urban","Energy conservation; Housing; Integration; Characteristics; Governance; Sociotechnical; Sustainable energy; Urban; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069894976

This case is particularly relevant as the entire railway signalling system is currently being upgraded to the new European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) standard. This upgrade has significant implications for signal maintenance scheduling in the system. We formulate the problem as a multi-depot vehicle routing and scheduling problem with time windows and synchronisation constraints, in a multi-day time schedule. The requirement that some tasks require the simultaneous presence of more than one engineer means that task synchronisation must be considered. A multi-stage constructive framework is proposed, which first distributes maintenance tasks using a clustering formulation. Following this, a Constraint Programming (CP) based approach is used to generate feasible monthly plans for large instances of practical interest. Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can generate feasible solutions and schedule a monthly plan of up to 1000 tasks for eight crew members, in a reasonable amount of computational time. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

While they may be able to build on a base of existing sub-solutions, e.g. standard product structures, modules or parts when engineering a customer-specific solution, they often have to create something completely new to satisfy customers’ requirements. However, it is not always clear to ETO companies what the costs associated with making customer specific solutions are, or which product or project characteristics drive costs and in what business processes. Therefore, it is not clear to companies if it is actually profitable for them to fulfil all of their customers’ requirements. Hence, making it relevant to understand how creating non-standard customisations impact project profitability. This paper presents a framework for how ETO companies can quantify the impact of the complexity associated with non-standard customisations when cost data is only available at the project level. The framework is theoretically founded; it is based on statistical regression and a definition of a complexity index for non-standard customisations. The framework is validated in the context of an ETO case company and empirical data is presented. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","complexity analysis; engineer to order; impact analysis; mass customisation; product customisation","Costs; Digital storage; Engineers; Profitability; Sales; Complexity analysis; Engineer to orders; Impact analysis; Mass customisation; Product customisation; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046645467

Otherwise, costs might be cut without considering the long-term effects and, consequently, the overall cost of the pathway could increase. Unfortunately, current methods of evaluation present several issues: (1) they do not provide valid insights regarding the effects of a given improvement effort until several years later, (2) they provide imprecise and biased results, and (3) the aggregated results are not useful for identifying and disseminating the best practices that lead to an improvement. In this article, the accelerated longitudinal design with decomposition of total costs (ALDD) method is applied to evaluate the effects of improvement efforts on inpatient utilization for long cardiac pathways at a Danish hospital. The results show that the ALDD method can deliver valid results much faster than traditional methods and can uncover hidden improvements in the local work processes of clinical teams. Application of the ALDD method at a hospital in Denmark identified a significant reduction (15.4%) in the mean total bed utilization per cardiac pathway and revealed that this reduction was caused by improvements in the work processes. © 2019 Foundation of the American College of Healthcare Executives.

A sample of N = 180 Lebanese consumers was interviewed in several retail outlets using a hard laddering questionnaire. The data were subjected to frequency analysis, cluster analysis, and structural equation modelling. Hierarchal value maps constructed from the laddering interviews revealed that “quality of life,” “pleasure,” and “peace of mind” are the main values driving organic food consumption in Lebanon. Frequent organic consumers displayed higher concern for their family's health and for the environment, whereas occasional organic consumers cared more about their own pleasure and were more likely to perceive organic food as a traditional and nostalgic product. Structural equation modelling revealed that “care for nature” and “care for children's health” significantly affect consumers' (self-reported) purchasing behaviour. The found means-end chains are a useful basis for marketing campaigns for organic food products in the Lebanese market. One focus of marketing campaigns should be raising consumers' awareness on the environmental benefits of organic production and the fact that it does not allow the use of harmful chemical products. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074556562

We construct a game-theoretic model of the interaction between HQ and subsidiaries, and, building on procedural justice theory, we analyze the motivational costs that can result from the anticipation or realization of HQ intervention in subsidiary initiatives. We also analyze the implications for MNC-level value creation when HQ managers, fearing subsidiary managers’ emotion-based reactions, refrain from intervening. We derive a number of counter-intuitive results, for example, that good HQ behavior may involve forgoing opportunities for value creation, and that procedural justice systems may sometimes be counterproductive. Managerial Summary: Headquarters (HQ) in multinational corporations are required to balance global integration and local autonomy within the organization. This balancing act sometimes requires HQ to intervene in subsidiary matters and to overrule the subunits’ decisions. While an intervention might create integration advantages, it may also have a negative impact on the motivation of subsidiary managers, who might feel that their effort and their decisions are overruled. We focus on such motivational issues and investigate how fair decision-making processes applied by the HQ influence subsidiaries’ entrepreneurial behavior and their reactions to the overruling. Our findings show that, under specific conditions, HQ need to forgo value-creating interventions, and that a strong focus on a procedural justice culture within the firm can be detrimental. © 2019 Strategic Management Society","headquarters; initiatives; motivation; procedural justice; subsidiaries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074354075

Until now it has been theoretically unclear and insufficiently empirically tested whether affiliation advantages extend to the foreign subsidiaries of group members. We attempt to determine if they do, and if so, to identify the boundary conditions that matter. We analyze a large panel of 451 foreign subsidiaries of 136 Indian multinational firms over the 2003–2012 period and find that BG affiliation does enhance foreign subsidiary performance when host-market institutions are weak and when the parent is in manufacturing. Managerial Summary: Our research speaks directly to managers of multinational firms who seek to leverage the benefits of BG affiliation across national borders. We show that BG affiliation is only beneficial when the foreign subsidiary is located in a country characterized by weak institutions and when the parent is in manufacturing. If, on the other hand, the foreign subsidiary is in a country with well-functioning institutions and the parent in services, managers will not be able to count on BG advantages, rather they will have to develop competitive capabilities locally, that is, the foreign subsidiary will have to function more like a standalone firm. © 2019 Strategic Management Society","business groups; foreign subsidiary; institutional quality; subsidiary performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074080716

One of the major challenges of these processes is related to the quality assurance of the manufactured surfaces: the time needed to perform accurate 3D surface acquisitions is typically much longer than a single moulding cycle, thus making impossible to integrate in-line measurements in the process chain. In this work, the authors proposed a novel solution to this problem by defining a process monitoring strategy aiming at linking sensitive in-line monitored process variables with the replication quality. A nano-structured surface for antibacterial applications was manufactured on a metal insert by laser structuring and replicated using two different polymers, polyoxymethylene (POM) and polycarbonate (PC). The replication accuracy was determined using a laser scanning confocal microscope and its dependence on the variation of the main μIM parameters was studied using a Design of Experiments (DoE) experimental approach. During each process cycle, the temperature distribution of the polymer inside the cavity was measured using a high-speed infrared camera by means of a sapphire window mounted in the movable plate of the mould. The temperature measurements showed a high level of correlation with the replication performance of the μIM process, thus providing a fast and effective way to control the quality of the moulded surfaces in-line. © 2019 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Flow visualization; In-line quality assurance; Micro-injection moulding; Surface replication","Acetal resins; Design of experiments; Flow visualization; Infrared imaging; Injection molding; Nanostructures; Process monitoring; Quality assurance; Sapphire; Temperature measurement; Experimental approaches; High-speed thermal imaging; In-line process control; Laser scanning confocal microscopes; Micro-injection mouldings; Nanostructured surface; Replication accuracies; Surface replications; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073598003

This strategy for financing garnered significant attention because acute care hospitals in the state transitioned from a fee-for-service hospital payment system to a prospective frame-based budget. Applying the conceptual framework of Miller and Power [Academy of Management Annals, 7(1), 557–605], we emphasise how calculative practices actively influence organisational structure decision-making. The study investigates the reciprocal role of accounting practices in the facilitation of hospital policies. Findings demonstrate that accounting practices recursively constitute and reshape the organisation of hospitals. The policy change to Global Budgets has influenced accounting practices, which likewise have promoted large organisational changes that increase engagement with external stakeholders. The consequences of the Global Budget policy have been significant, leading to highly complex administrative practices while also necessitating a cost shifting in order to subsidise physician costs, due to the separation of hospitals and physician organisations. However, we also witness how Global Budgets and the combination of centralised monitoring with decentralised managerial freedom substantiate remarkable holistic quality initiatives. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","accounting; budgeting; costs; hospitals; quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073543591

Among these biases is herding behavior; that is, the tendency to imitate the funding decisions of others. Herding is a very robust phenomenon in crowdfunding and uniformly characterized as a positive reinforcement effect. We challenge this characterization and ask whether the funding decisions of others may in fact have a negative effect and lead to a reduction of follow-up funding decisions if they are very small – a phenomenon to which we refer as reverse herding. We conducted a field experiment at a reward-based crowdfunding platform by randomly contributing small funding amounts to some campaigns while keeping track of a non-manipulated control group. Our findings support the notion of reverse herding. The number and amount of contributions by the crowd following our small funding amounts were fewer and smaller than in the control group. We discuss reverse herding in relation to established crowdfunding concepts and formulate a dilemma of small contributions: Although small contributions are a fundamental part of crowdfunding, they can also cause the detrimental effect of reverse herding.

In the investigated SC, the manufacturer produces a good with an arbitrarily green level and sells it to the distributor. The distributor has two choices: (1) selling product through a direct e-channel, or (2) selling product to a retailer. Demand in both e-channel and retail channel depends on price and green level of the product. The manufacturer, the distributor, and the retailer decide on the green level of product, the price in e-channel, and the retail price of the product, respectively. The problem is investigated in three different decision-making structures. At first, the open triad and the closed triad decision structures are analyzed and optimal decisions for all SC members are extracted. This study contributes to the literature by developing a coordinated, environmentally friendly decision model for a multi-tier dual-channel SC structure. According to the findings, compared to the open triad, the closed triad structure is profitable for the SC at the expense of one or more members, who will thus not adopt it. Secondly, a mathematical programming model, labeled as transitional model, is proposed to achieve coordination. The transitional triad guarantees the manufacturer's profit, while keeping customer prices lower and greenness higher than the open triad. The numerical studies and sensitivity analyses show that the proposed model not only is profitable for all SC members, but also increases green level of the product and reduces prices in both the e-channel and retail channel. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dual-channel; Green product; Multi-tier supply chain management; Pricing; Supply chain coordination","Costs; Decision making; Mathematical programming; Profitability; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Telecommunication industry; Coordinated decision; Decision-making structure; Dual channel; Dual channel supply chain; Green products; Mathematical programming models; Multi-tier; Supply chain coordination; Green manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072716341

In this study, we argue that electrified, automated LRT systems can fulfill private functional frames, private symbolic frames, societal functional frames, and societal symbolic frames. In particular, we argue that light rail can fulfill private functional frames (making passengers feel safe, offering a cheap and efficient mode of transport), private symbolic frames (signifying political identity or exclusionary planning), societal functional frames (environmental stewardship), and societal symbolic frames (such as modernism or innovativeness, or the lack of it). Essentially, these frames encompass not only what light rail is and does, but what it means and represents, and even some of its failures and challenges. The article then identifies ten specific frames associated with two case studies of automated light rail systems, the established Docklands Light Rail (DLR) in the United Kingdom, and the emerging Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) in Poland. We find that the DLR is not only a vital part of meeting (functional) demand for mobility, it is innovative and exciting to ride, legitimation of a conservative approach to project development, a social injustice (to some), an environmentally friendly alternative to cars, and a perceived magnet for global investment into the greater Docklands area. Similarly, the PRT is not only a reliable and safe mode of transit, but also a technical marvel, a monopoly breaking symbol, a clean and sustainable form of mobility, and a reflection of either progressive Polish innovation and entrepreneurship, or enduring failure. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Automated mobility; Light rail; Light Rail Rapid Transit (LRRT); Light rail vehicles (LRVs); Light Rapid Transit (LRT); Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)","Automation; Electric lighting; Railroad transportation; Rapid transit; Urban transportation; Conservative approaches; Environmental stewardship; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Light rail; Light rail vehicle; Personal rapid transits; Project development; Technological frame; Light rail transit; development project; mobility; political integration; railway transport; transportation planning; transportation technology; urban transport; Docklands; England; London [England]; Poland [Central Europe]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072318451

One recent trend in the takedown of unlawful online content is the emergence of models, where trusted third parties – private or public – are given privileged notification channels for flagging infringing content. Despite increasing practical importance, these arrangements have received little scholarly attention. This article explores the functioning of trusted notifier-models and how they are addressed by the European lawmaker in the context of two intermediaries, online platforms and domain name registries. Depending on intermediary, trusted notifier-models can both be seen as extension of the existing notice-and-takedown regimes and an additional voluntary expedited-enforcement layer. The author argues that these trusted notifier-models are problematic given the broad room of autonomy that the legislator is leaving to private parties. Whereas models involving public authorities are subject to general administrative law principles as well as constitutional and human rights safeguards, the framework for private regulation (i.e. without intervention of public actors) is less clear. In the field of domain names, these legitimacy issues give raise to special concern given the detached relation between domain names and website content. The paper criticizes the lack of insights into existing arrangements and calls for increased transparency. The author concludes that a legislative minimum framework is desirable. © 2019 Sebastian Felix Schwemer","Domain name system; Online enforcement; Online platforms; Private ordering; Privatization of enforcement; Recommendation (EU) 2018/334; Trusted notifiers","Privatization; Websites; Domain name system; Online enforcement; Online platforms; Private orderings; Recommendation (EU) 2018/334; Trusted notifiers; Laws and legislation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071138500

As sharing is a predominately urban phenomenon in modern societies, cities around the globe have become both locus of action and central actor in the debates over the nature and organization of the sharing economy. However, cities vary substantially in the interpretation of potential opportunities and challenges, as well as in their governance responses. Building on a qualitative comparative analysis of 16 leading global cities, our findings reveal four framings of the sharing economy: ‘societal endangerment,’ ‘societal enhancement,’ ‘market disruption,’ and ‘ecological transition.’ Such framings go hand in hand with patterned governance responses: although there is considerable heterogeneity in the combination of public governance strategies, we find specific configurations of framings and public governance strategies. Our work reflects the political and ethical debates on various economic, social, and moral issues related to the sharing economy, and contributes to a better understanding of the field-level institutional arrangements—a prerequisite for examining moral behavior of sharing economy organizations. © 2019, The Author(s).","Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (f-s QCA); Global cities; Governance strategies; Public governance; Sharing economy; Urban governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069729855

Performance evaluation has emerged as a viable solution for this problem, but no universal ST assessment model has yet been developed for this purpose. Various authors have proposed different approaches, but these still exhibit limitations, especially regarding criteria selection and weighting. This study sought to create an assessment system for ST by combining cognitive mapping and the Choquet integral (CI), providing a rational, transparent foundation for the selection and weighting of evaluation criteria. The development of the proposed assessment system involved group meetings with a panel of ST experts, as well as a final validation session with a senior representative of the Portuguese Tourism Confederation. The results of a practical application of the system developed show that its process-oriented nature facilitates the ranking of tourism regions according to their degree of sustainability (i.e., Lisbon and Tagus Valley is the Portuguese tourism region with the most ST, whereas Alentejo comes last compared to the other alternatives). No prior research was found that has applied cognitive mapping and the CI in this study context, and new insights into ST can be obtained through an analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships between evaluation criteria. The contributions and implications of the proposed system are also discussed. © 2019","Choquet integral; Cognitive mapping; Sustainability; Sustainable tourism; Tourism","Cognitive systems; Integral equations; Mapping; Cause-and-effect relationships; Choquet integral; Cognitive mapping; Evaluation criteria; Socio-technical approach; Sustainability practices; Sustainable tourism; Tourism; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069633368

However, efficiency of this food waste avoidance action can be improved by knowing for which product category, which store type, which accompanying communication, and which consumer characteristics this action works best. This study uses an experimental online survey conducted in five North western European countries to investigate the effect of communication appealing to either self- or others-centred motives in either supermarkets or farmers' markets, for packaged and for fresh food. It is found that both messages – communicating budget saving or an emotional appeal - are effective in increasing choice likelihood. Store type affects choice likelihood of suboptimal packaged, while others-centred values and trust in the store affects choice likelihood for suboptimal fresh food. Communication improves quality perception of suboptimal fresh food. Findings imply that fresh suboptimal foods lend themselves more to be promoted with others-centred messages, or to be targeted at consumers with others-centred values. Sales of suboptimal food in the store should be accompanied by communication, and such efforts to tackle food waste in the store should focus on fresh food in particular. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Communication; Food waste; Quality perception; Store type; Suboptimal food; Value orientation","Communication; Industrial engineering; Production engineering; European Countries; Food waste; Online surveys; Price reductions; Product categories; Quality perceptions; Store type; Value orientation; Budget control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068898567

In this paper, I take it as my starting point that both costing and caring vary as they are combined in professional decision-making processes. I use the broad and processual definition of calculation from the work of Callon and Muniesa to analyze how distinctions about vulnerable children's situations are made relevant for the choice and delimitation of social services.

Recent studies on future employment discuss whether growth in computer power and advances in artificial intelligence enable the automation of non-routine tasks, including tasks that require creativity and innovation, which are among the most unique human capacities. However, this discussion generally lacks research-based concepts of creativity and innovation. In order to clarify the discussion on the division of labor, relevant theories of creativity and innovation are introduced. The inquiry shows that creativity and innovation consist in making new connections between domains or practices. While computers and robotics are capable of operating only within specific domains, in which rules apply or data are available, creativity and innovation operate beyond the boundaries of such domains and must be guided by emotions and driven by moods. This suggests that computers and robotics make rapid change possible, but cannot solve the task of creating change themselves. The educational implications are that it is vital to cultivate the unique human capacities of sensing, understanding, handling and creating change, and to teach students and employees to collaborate with computers and robotics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Creativity; Digitalization; Division of labor; Educational implications; Innovation","Education; Computer power; Creativity; Digitalization; Division of labor; Educational implications; Robotics; artificial intelligence; educational development; employment; future prospect; labor division; machinery; robotics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065625351

Particularly, decision makers are being increasingly motivated to improve their supply chain activities in coping efficiently with the objectives of sustainable development. Where the era of sustainability threatens the current supply chain partners to either cope with the new regulations of sustainability or leave the field for new players. Notwithstanding, most of the recent studies considered economic and green criteria in handling sustainable supplier selection and order allocation (SSS/OA) problems overlooking the social criteria which represents the third pillar of sustainability. This work aims at putting forward a hybrid Multi Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)-Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) approach for a sustainable supplier selection and order allocation problem by considering economic, environmental and social criteria. Thus, an integrated Fuzzy AHP-Fuzzy TOPSIS is proposed to assess and rank suppliers according to three sets of criteria (i.e. conventional, green and social). A Multi-Objective Optimization Model (MOOM) is developed for choosing suppliers and allocating the optimal order quantities. To cope with the multiple uncertainties in the input data, the MOOM is reformulated into a Fuzzy Multi-Objective Optimization Model.

IS research has expanded far beyond its initial focus by generating new knowledge within but also attracting increased attention from adjacent fields. As a result, the broad understanding of IS and its diversity in applications has resulted in blurry boundaries of the field, making its contemporary delineation, synthesis, and assessment of its progress challenging. Using a combination of data-driven techniques from bibliometrics, natural language processing, and network analysis, this paper maps and analyzes the structure of knowledge production and the process of knowledge integration in current research. We find an overall growing tendency toward increasing diversity in the knowledge bases from which the field draws, accompanied by a decreasing coherence of collective research efforts. We point to the crucial role of institutions and academic entrepreneurs in shaping these developments in interdisciplinary and diverse fields, illustrating this by the role of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bibliometrics; Coherence; Diversity; Innovation systems; Knowledge bases; Networks","Coherent light; International cooperation; Networks (circuits); Bibliometrics; Diversity; Innovation system; Knowledge basis; Knowledge integration; NAtural language processing; Organisation for economic co-operation and development; Structure of knowledge; Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065422060

As an alternative to the concept of the boundaryless career, we introduce that of the liminal career. We consider a liminal career as occurring when the normal career path within an organization becomes a state of ‘betwixt and between’, wherein distinctions between social domains and work roles become diffuse, indeterminate and difficult to comprehend. We engage with this concept in relation to three boundaries that remain central within career development: organizational boundaries establishing a distinction between that which is internal and external to the organization, hierarchical boundaries separating employees and managers, and functional boundaries demarcating different work domains. Using a case that illustrates how employees experience ambiguous organizational, hierarchical and functional boundaries, we argue that the concept of the liminal career captures the essence of situations in which there is a lack of clear categories, trajectories and schemes from which to structure career paths in organizations. © The Author(s) 2019.","Ambiguity; boundaryless career; career development; flexibility; liminal career; liminality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061991248

However, little is known about the conditions supporting them to open up successfully in open foresight. This research takes a culture perspective on this issue. The leading assumption is that companies with an open culture are more likely to engage in collaboration than companies with a culture inhibiting openness. We use the Competing Values Framework to measure corporate culture, and collaboration breadth and depth to measure openness to external collaboration. Drawing on a sample of 168 Austrian companies, the research confirms that culture plays an important role in creating an environment supportive of open foresight, albeit in a somewhat surprising way: the internally oriented clan culture appears to support openness, while the externally oriented market culture does not support it. Possible explanations for this finding are put forward as directions for further research. The findings should help companies to predict whether they have the cultural conditions in place to embark on an open foresight journey successfully. © 2019 The Authors R&D Management published by RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061942084

First, we challenge current understandings of coworking spaces as neutral containers for independent work. Instead, we show how coworking incorporates the disposition of becoming organizational. That is, coworking spaces can frame and organize work and may even provide a basis for collective action. Second, we add to research on organizing outside traditional organizations by drawing attention to the complex and shifting interplay of formal and informal relationships in such settings.

It does so by stressing the ethical and organizational conflicts generated in the aspiration to revive this ethos. Empirically, this exploration is done by examining a code introduced in the Danish state-bureaucracy in the aftermath of a number of political-administrative scandals. We show how the ethos of bureaucracy on the one hand has been repressed and displaced and, on the other hand, in light of the scandals, now reappears as something indispensable. At the same time, the article exposes how the revitalization attempt encounters considerable obstacles. By situating the code in relation to changing bureaucratic structures, semantic ideals, and civil servants’ reflections, we show how the revived ethos takes on monstrous proportions. Despite this transfiguration, we argue that the failed attempt at revitalization is no cause to dispense with the ethos of bureaucracy. The article is distinctive in how it bridges hitherto uncoupled streams of literature that are mobilized in the investigation of a critical case. In so doing, it adds to these literatures and seeks to revive critical organizational theorizing in light of current neo-liberal and populist sources of power. © The Author(s) 2018.","Bureaucracy; codes; ethics; ethos of office; neo-bureaucracy; organization; organization theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058996985

Grounded in empirical examples, the paper unfolds why the phenomenon seems to be missing from the literature of the becoming view (e.g. Tsoukas and Chia, 2002). Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by the methodological strategy of “studying through,” organizational changes are followed through space and time within the setting of a Nordic bank, from where the empirical data have been collected via longitudinal study. The empirical data are generated through a combination of methods: shadowing, interviews, in situ observations and desk research in order to capture the ever-changing phenomenon of organizational change. Findings: The paper finds that organizational changes drift away, either by slipping into the everyday practices of the organization, or by drifting away in time when history is reinterpreted. The paper concludes that organizational change failures suffer the same fate as organizational changes more generally and drift away in space and time. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the becoming view by illustrating how methodologically an ever-changing phenomenon such as organizational change can be studied. Further, it contributes to the field of organizational change failure by unpacking the fate of organizational change failure when change is natural and slippery in nature.

Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on screenshots of four months of coworker communication on ISM in a Danish bank and on semi-structured interviews with 24 employees. Findings: Employees succeeded in speaking up and gaining support on ISM by using eight different discursive tactics. These tactics helped move organizational issues from an operational to a strategic level, thus making the issues relevant for management as well as gaining the support of other coworkers. The visibility and persistence of communication on ISM forced managers to react. Research limitations/implications: Further research should investigate whether similar tactics and reactions occur in organizations with a less open communication culture where it might be less safe for employees to speak up. Practical implications: Organizations need to be aware of the dynamics of the “spiral of voice” and of the way in which the visibility and persistence of communication on ISM forces managers to handle organizational issues. Originality/value: This study is the first to explore what happens when employees speak up on ISM and to propose the concept of “a spiral of voice” as an extension of the theory of “the spiral of silence” (Noelle-Neumann, 1974). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee communication; Internal communication; Internal social media; Organizational communication; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073925076

The proposed value creation configuration approaches are seen as means for supplier firms to strengthen their competitiveness when faced with increasing global sourcing. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data on supplier firms in Denmark are used in a hierarchical cluster analysis. The identified clusters are interpreted as expressions of different value creation configurations pursued by suppliers with regards to relations with their most important customers. Findings: Three types of suppliers are identified: detached suppliers, which seek to create customer net benefits through low costs; technology-focused suppliers, which design value creation around benefits linked to being at the technological forefront; and integrated suppliers, which share characteristics with technology-focused suppliers, but also align closely with a relatively broader range of customer activities. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the specificity of findings from one small, open economy with an extensive supplier base. Practical implications: For managers in supplier companies, the research suggest value configurations can be used as strategic templates for further specialization and as way to assess and address value creation potential in customer firms. Originality/value: Previous studies tend to overlook suppliers’ developments of value-creating activities to maintain customer relationships. The paper takes a supplier perspective to deepen the empirically based understanding of value creation configurations followed by high-cost country suppliers in the context of increasing global competition and production relocation. Theoretical implications as well as lessons formanagers in supplier firms of the identification of the different approaches to value creation configurations are presented. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Backshoring; Both; Buyer–supplier relationships; Collaboration; Innovation; Localisation issues; New business or process or operations models; Supplier or partner selection; Supplier taxonomy; Value configuration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074176659

Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a 2 (social risk) × 2 (brand type) between-subjects design experiment employing a Qualtrics online panel in the UK. Findings: The study shows that NBs still have the edge over PPLs when consumers shop for socially risky situations, which is due to higher product expectations of NBs, and a moderated mediation shows that this effect is more pronounced among consumers that feel negative emotions when shopping at Lidl. Research limitations/implications: This study included leading NBs, which differ in terms of price compared to selected PPLs. Researchers should include pricing information as an additional factor and investigate Lidl’s options to deal with negative emotions in the online setting.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on an extensive literature study working with the limitations of the relatively recent publication of IT4IT™ and the normative character of IT4IT™. A mixed-method case study is presented based on an IT service provider organisation. Both a qualitative method and a systems and design oriented method are being used. Findings: IT4IT™ can provide value and a clearer understanding of the service delivery framework if the technological core of the focal organisation is adapted to a value stream thinking. This suggests a more operational character of all IT processes and analogue to general MoT frameworks and corporate governance models. Research limitations/implications: Given the recent publication of the IT4IT™ framework, this study is primarily ex ante and suggests further full-scale ex post research in the future. Practical implications: Validation and successful implementation of the IT4IT™ framework will give companies better opportunities for safe and controlled value creation using IT. Control connects with risk reduction and less risk can encourage innovation and “tame” development complexity. Using value streams will align IT better with manufacturing and services.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses mixed methods by combining in-depth case studies with an executive forum with those of senior industry stakeholders. The two in-depth supply network case studies were carried out through multiple interviews with focal (or ‘developer’) firms that supply energy through offshore wind power and key suppliers such as wind turbine manufacturers. Findings: The findings show the challenges the offshore wind power industry faces because of complex supply networks, including attempts by several actors to exert their power and control. Despite the networks facing similar complexities and challenges, two distinctly different strategies for orchestrating and governing supply networks are uncovered: one strategy resembles an interventionist strategy, while the other is based on delegation. Research limitations/implications: Based on the findings, the authors identify and develop a classification of complex supply network divided into intervention and delegation strategies, thereby adding to existing research on ways to manage complex supply networks. Practical implications: The authors identify strategies for focal firms for managing in complex supply networks, based on control and intervention or coordination and delegation.

The objective of the model is to minimize the total cost and environmental emissions through making the best decisions on facility location, transportation amounts and inventory balances. According to the inherent complexity of the problem and considering multi-product, multi-period and multi- modality assumptions makes it hard to handle, and as for the solution approach, an effective accelerated benders decomposition algorithm is implemented. Then, computational results for a set of numerical example are discussed. Besides, the model and solution approach are applied on a wire-and-cable industry. Then, a sensitivity analysis is implemented in an effort to validate the model. Results reveal applicability of the proposed mathematical model and presented solution approach. Following the obtained results, it can be validly concluded that the suggested solution approach leads to more than 13 percent reduction in total cost for the studied case, and can be even employed for larger and more complex real-world industrial applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benders decomposition algorithm; Closed-loop supply chain; Green networks; Multi-objective optimization; Network design","Location; Multiobjective optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic programming; Supply chains; Benders decomposition algorithm; Closed-loop supply chain; Closed-loop supply chain network designs; Computational results; Environmental emissions; Green networks; Network design; Wire and cable industry; Complex networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068866089

The objective of this study is to generate a decision support framework in perspectives of the selection and successful implementation towards environment-friendly products by comparing profits of each member, greening level, consumer surplus and environmental improvement under two different incentive policies. Twelve analytical models are formulated and analyzed by considering the impact of two game structures, single and two-period procurement decisions on the sustainability goals of supply chain members. The objectives of government's social welfare are optimized here. A comprehensive analysis reveals that the manufacturer receives higher profits and the greening level is always at higher end in two-period procurement decision under manufacturer-Stackelberg game. The greening level and profit of the retailer are maximum in single-period procurement decision under retailer-Stackelberg game. As a result, optimal preference is highly sensitive to game structure and procurement decision. When the manufacturer sets a premeditated threshold for greening level, supply chain members receive higher profits under incentive policy on per-unit product because of lower sales price, higher consumer surplus and environmental improvement compared to government incentive policy on total investment in R&D. The greening level is maximum under incentive policy on total investment in R&D that results in higher environmental improvement.

A key question is whether second-hand textiles actually replace new items, and it is of particular importance in order to assess the environmental impact of textile handling and treatment. This study determined the replacement rate through face-to-face questionnaire surveys conducted in Angola, Malawi and Mozambique. In total, 3485 respondents and 14,190 purchased second-hand textile items formed the basis for determining replacement rates, namely 63 ± 6% in Angola, 35 ± 1% in Malawi and 37 ± 5% for Mozambique, and according to a set of main categories (clothing, household textiles and other textile products) and product types. The rates varied between product types, but the relatively low replacement rates were surprising and possibly caused by the respondents' limited purchasing power, i.e. that buying new textile items was not an option. This was supported by several findings, such as respondents’ wardrobes consisting largely of second-hand clothes and the purchase of second-hand items to upgrade or to replace damaged items. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Face-to-face interviews; National differences; Purchasing power; Replacement rates; Second-hand textiles","Environmental impact; Purchasing; Sales; Surveys; Waste treatment; Current handling; Face-to-face interview; Household textiles; National differences; Purchasing power; Questionnaire surveys; Replacement rates; Waste management systems; Textiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068546253

The system is most efficient for manure with less than 12% total solids content. Results also show that the liquid region above the cooling pipes features one-dimensional transient heat transfer formed by unique flow patterns. A simplified analytical model is derived to predict the surface temperature of liquid manure. The analytical solution shows that the manure surface temperature can be reduced by 7.4 and 12 °C after 2 and 5 h, respectively. The temperature reduction results in up to 37.3% decrease in ammonia emissions with only 0.8% of the total energy use in livestock buildings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical models; CFD; Energy efficiency; Environmental pollution; Hydraulic cooling","Agriculture; Air pollution control; Ammonia; Analytical models; Animals; Atmospheric temperature; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Fertilizers; Hydraulic equipment; Manures; Numerical methods; Surface properties; Analytical and numerical methods; Environmental pollutions; Hydraulic cooling systems; Livestock buildings; Surface temperatures; Temperature reduction; Total solids contents; Transient heat transfer; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068516090

Additives have been considered as a useful option to mitigate these environmental emissions, but the wider effects of using different additives on multiple gas emissions is still uncertain. Here, a global meta-analysis was conducted using 105 studies with 303 paired comparisons, to quantify the impact of different additives on NH3 and GHG emissions, considering different composting feedstock properties. On average, additives reduced the total nitrogen (TN) loss (46.4%), NH3 (44.5%), N2O (44.6%) and CH4 (68.5%) emissions, and total GHG emissions expressed as global warming potential (GWP) (54.2%) during composting. Chemical, physical and microbial additives all significantly reduced TN loss and NH3 emission; however, the strongest effect was observed for chemical additives under the condition of low moisture content (≤65%), low C/N ratios (≤20) or alkalinity (pH &gt; 7.5). Specifically, PO4 3− and Mg2+ salt had the greatest mean mitigation for TN loss (68.0%) and NH3 emission (62.0%). In contrast, physical additives (e.g. biochar and zeolite) were more effective at reducing the total GHG emissions (67.2%) compared with chemical additives because of the greater mitigation of N2O emission. Low moisture content (≤65%) or low C/N ratios (≤20) enhanced the effectiveness of chemical additives in reducing TN loss and NH3 emission. Physical additives were suggested to be more effective in reducing N2O emission at low moisture content (≤65%) or high C/N ratios (&gt;20 to ≤ 30). The magnitude of the mitigation of TN loss and NH3 emission increased as the dosage rate of PO4 3− and Mg2+ salt/superphosphate increased between 0 and 20%. This meta-analysis suggests that an optimized combination of chemical and physical additives tailored to feedstock characteristics and application dosage may be a promising approach for the synergistic mitigation of NH3 and GHG emissions. © 2019","Ammonia emission; Composting; Different additives; GHGs emission; Meta-analysis; Nitrogen losses","Alkalinity; Ammonia; Chemical analysis; Composting; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Moisture; Moisture determination; Nitrogen oxides; Solid wastes; Waste treatment; Zeolites; Ammonia emissions; Environmental emissions; GHGs emissions; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Meta analysis; Nitrogen loss; Optimized combinations; Additives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068439488

Annex 57 collated and analysed over 80 detailed quantitative and qualitative building case studies from the participating nations. For many years the multiple variations in methodological approach of case studies to assess the whole life embodied impacts of buildings have presented a major challenge for politicians and other decision makers. Any real change in design and construction practice has also proved elusive. This paper describes a modified research synthesis and meta analysis as a novel and valid method for drawing meaningful conclusions from large sets of significantly diverse studies. The quantitative analyses consider embodied impacts of the product stage, replacement, and end of life stages, of new and refurbished buildings, and of different building assemblies and construction materials. The product stage is shown to dominate in most cases, with the median value around two thirds of the whole life embodied impacts, with replacements the next highest with a median figure of around 25%; however replacements in five studies were over 50% of the whole life impacts. It should be noted that several life cycle stages are still missing from these studies. The case studies included eleven refurbishment projects, in which energy efficient measures and low carbon technologies were retrofitted to existing buildings; for these projects the median product stage impact was found to be just under half that for the new build projects. While further research is required to compare the operational energy use in the new and refurbished buildings, this suggests that such energy refurbishments have a significantly lower impact than new buildings. Several other studies considered the impacts from technical equipment and internal fixtures and fittings, both frequently excluded, and demonstrated that they can be responsible for up to 45% of the whole life embodied greenhouse gases and up to 48% of the whole life embodied energy. Finally, the paper combines the analysis of the quantitative case studies with that of qualitative studies, to explore the impact of contextual factors at both policy and project level in significantly reducing the embodied environmental impacts of buildings. The case studies have shown that planning authorities, major clients, developers, and individual designers, can all play an important role in reducing embodied impacts through encouraging innovation. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy makers, designers and LCA modelers which will support and effect real reductions in the whole life embodied impacts of buildings. © 2019","Case study analysis; Embodied carbon; Meta-analysis and research synthesis","Building materials; Buildings; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Restoration; Case study analysis; Design and construction practice; Embodied carbons; Embodied environmental impact; International energy agency; Methodological approach; Qualitative case studies; Research synthesis; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068398053

Drawing on field research in post-conflict northern Uganda, we show how groups of disenfranchised young people use social bricolage to create social change in a volatile situation marked by extreme resource deprivation and a plethora of challenges arising in the aftermath of war. Based on empirical data, we outline three key practices of social bricolage employed to cope with resource scarcity, extended crisis and volatility. First, we unravel the practice of securing resources and creating social value by mobilizing peers. Second, we show how pluriactivity is used to stretch and make the most of scarce resources in a shifting environment. Third, we illuminate the practice of rekindling pre-war cultural resources to reunite fragmented communities. By illuminating these practices and showing how the context of the post-conflict developing country setting influences the dynamics of ‘making do with resources at hand’, we seek to extend social bricolage theory. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","developing countries; post-conflict; Social bricolage; social entrepreneurship; Uganda; youth","developing world; empirical analysis; entrepreneur; participatory approach; resource scarcity; social change; social conflict; social development; young population; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063860158

Although social ventures strive for growth to scale their social impact, pursuing growth often results in mission drift and the sacrifice of social objectives, which in turn eventually undermine the ventures’ raison d’être. In this study, we investigate how and with what outcomes social ventures that pursue growth can manage the balance of social and economic missions. Through a comparative case study of six for-profit social ventures, we find significant differences in how dual missions are selected, connected, and intertwined, leading to varying degrees of mission spillover effects between social and economic missions. Our findings show that two-sided mission spillover effects are a central mechanism in dual mission management, enabling social ventures to pursue balanced growth, avoid mission drift, and achieve social impact. With these findings, this study adds to the emergent literature on social entrepreneurship, dual mission management, and social venture growth. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","balance; dual mission management; mission drift; mission spillover effects; Social entrepreneurship; social venture growth","comparative study; entrepreneur; management; social impact; spillover effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058693394

The book consolidates the current status of academic work on business and development, identifies state of the art in relation to this academic field, and establishes a future research agenda for 'business and development studies' as an emerging academic discipline within the social sciences. The book will be of interest to researchers and students, including economists, geographers, sociologists, political scientists, corporate social responsibility specialists, and development scholars who are seeking an in-depth overview of current debates about the role of business as a development agent in the Global South. The book is also of relevance to practitioners that are engaged in work with the private sector seeking to enhance the positive effects and minimize the negative economic, social, and environmental consequences of business activity in the Global South. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Peter Lund-Thomsen, Michael Wendelboe Hansen and Adam Lindgreen; individual chapters, the contributors.

Parts of the scholarship distinguish between upward and downward accountability. Upward accountability would involve acknowledgement of an authority to sanction or validate operations or claims, whereas downward accountability refers to the institution of authority being responsible to the general public for their actions. While the directionality of accountability is important, a case from Indonesia suggests that they may indeed be co-constitutive. By deliberately and publicly complying with the idea of state land ownership, and by being selective about what institutions represent 'the state', the farmers used their upward accountability to produce downward accountability in terms of recognition of their rights. The farmers exploited the separation of powers in their attempt to gain a new visibility. © The Author(s) 2020.","Accountability; Indonesia; Recognition; Social contract",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087099796

Design/methodology/approach: The paper argues for the use of pragmatic constructivism as a basis for development of a paradigmatic foundation for educating advanced students of management accounting. Furthermore, it contains an empirical insight through a case example of how pragmatic constructivism can be used as a pedagogical tool in different management accounting educational situations. Findings: The analysis shows how pragmatic constructivism can be used as a less reductionist paradigm than realism to tackle the research-teaching-practice deficiencies found in conventional thinking on accounting education. Pragmatic constructivism is shown to provide important methodological and conceptual elements in developing, understanding and guiding the application of management accounting techniques in dynamic business practices. Placing an emphasis on teaching methodological skills relevant for management accountants is shown to have an important impact on students and their ability to act as business partners. Research limitations/implications: The analysis is exploratory in the sense that a new paradigmatic framework for educating students of management accounting to be business partners is outlined and illustrated through its implementation in a specific master’s degree programme. However, this analysis should be viewed as only a first step towards developing pragmatic constructivism as a paradigmatic foundation for teaching management accounting as a basis for a business partner role. Originality/value: The proposed use of research on pragmatic constructivism as a basis for management accounting education to support a future business partner role is novel in the literature on management accounting.

This study focuses on smart consumers who voluntarily engage in value creation activities, in order to conceptualise smart experience co-creation (SEC) and the smart servicescape. Drawing on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) framework, a model is proposed and tested around the impacts of smart servicescape dimensions (aesthetics, superior functionality, social presence, perceived interactivity and perceived personalisation) on smart consumer experience co-creation. SEC is conceptualised as a second-order construct consisting of cognitive, hedonic, social/personal, and pragmatic/economic first-order dimensions. Results show that the technological environmental cues of the smart servicescape (S) collectively influence smart experience co-creation (O), and this co-created experience eventually influences consumers’ service brand equity and word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions (R).

This study aims to advance the understanding of the persistent gender gap in management. Design/methodology/approach: Samples from the gender-segregated Qatar and the co-ed Denmark present a unique opportunity to investigate the potential effects of gender. Here, 115 Middle Easterners and 121 Scandinavians rated perceived importance of job-related skills, networking upward and serendipity in leadership acquisition. Findings: Effects of gender showed that compared to men, women across cultures expected that serendipity has less to do with leadership acquisition. Middle Eastern women also showed low expectations regarding networking with people in powerful positions. Nevertheless, both genders showed conviction of meritocracy by rating job-related skills as the most important factor in leadership acquisition. Cross-culturally, Scandinavians presumed job-related skills to be more important than Middle Easterners. Research limitations/implications: Despite meritocracy beliefs, it appears that gender differences in perceived possibility of leadership acquisition contribute to the gender gap in management. Scandinavian women relied more on networking than Middle Eastern women, but still lacked faith in serendipitous opportunities compared to male peers. Perceived luck enhances achievement motivation. If men rely more on luck than women, then they are more confident in succeeding and more ambitious about pursuit of leadership.

The role of plant species diversity for “ecological intensification” of agriculture has been widely recognised, but the potential contribution of multi-trophic-level production systems, such as rice-fish co-culture, has received less attention. A continuous 4-year experiment (2015–2018) was conducted comparing rice-fish (yellow finless eel and loach) co-culture, and mono-rice planting practices on the Chongming Eco-island of China. During the experiment, pests (insect herbivores and weeds), arthropods, pesticides, grain and marketable fish yield were sampled, soil quality (available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, total nitrogen, organic matter content and pH) and rice grain quality (protein content, chalkiness, gel consistency, amylose content) were evaluated, and an economic analysis were performed. Fish decreased herbivore insect abundance by 24.07%, reduced weeds abundance, richness and biomass by 67.62, 62.01 and 58.88% respectively, increased invertebrate predator abundance by 19.48%, and reduced the need for pesticide by 23.4%. Co-culture practice produced an average economic values 10.33% higher than in the mono-rice farming. In addition, rice-fish co-culture enhanced both soil and rice quality. Our results confirm that rice-fish co-culture can be an effective form of ecological intensification, incorporating and contributing ecosystem services in agricultural production and increasing sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chongming eco-island; Land use change; Loach; Pesticide pollution; Soil environment; Yellow finless eel","Biodiversity; Economic analysis; Ecosystems; Fish; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Nitrogen; Pesticides; Quality control; Soils; Sustainable development; Chongming eco islands; Land-use change; Loach; Pesticide pollution; Soil environment; Grain (agricultural product)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068133623

Drawing upon the Ecodesign Maturity Model (EcoM2) as the theoretical foundation, this paper systematically reviews the literature on (i) relevant applications of dynamic modelling and (ii) relationships between ecodesign management practices and key business performance outcomes, in order to develop a simulation-based approach aimed at deriving a business case framework for ecodesign implementation. The resulting framework originates the “business case simulator”, which was subjected to the judgement and evaluation of six industry experts regarding its applicability and usefulness to manufacturing settings. The results are discussed and future research streams – coupled with improvement opportunities to the business case simulator – are pointed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Design for environment; Sustainability; Sustainable design; Sustainable product development; System dynamics","Commerce; Manufacture; Product design; Product development; Sustainable development; Consistent integrations; Environmental aspects; Manufacturing companies; Product development process; Simulation based approaches; Sustainable product development; System Dynamics; Theoretical foundations; Ecodesign",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068094040

However, the waste materials are often of lower quality than the virgin materials they substitute. When production processes are intolerant for lower quality materials, production issues may occur. This paper sets out to explore how firms can manage the waste quality through supplier integration with the waste supplier. As suppliers have to learn new knowledge, the construct of absorptive capacity is used as an interpretive lens. An in-depth longitudinal exploratory case study approach is used to examine the involvement of different individuals and departments in the supplier integration activities in the context of the waste-based fuel supply chain of a global cement producer. Qualitative and quantitative data was gathered at both the buyer and the supplier. The data show that buyers can increase the absorptive capacity of the suppliers by aligning their own knowledge bases with the scope of the supplier integration. The increased absorptive capacity enables the suppliers to align waste quality with production requirements. Managing waste quality is an important capability of industrial symbiosis, especially when firms want to go beyond the low-hanging fruits and increase the effectiveness of their industrial symbiosis activities. The research concludes with theoretical and managerial insights into how firms can organize the supplier integration to manage waste quality in the context of industrial symbiosis. © 2019","Absorptive capacity; Industrial symbiosis; Process industry; Supplier integration; Supply chain; Waste","Integration; Supply chains; Wastes; Absorptive capacity; Exploratory case studies; Industrial symbiosis; Process industries; Production issues; Production process; Production requirements; Supplier integration; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067811838

Findings: The results show that while interaction adjustment generally improves the experience of personal development, this effect is stronger for ATCKs. AMCKs will experience personal development almost independently of their interaction adjustment with host nationals solely due to the novelty of the international experience. For ATCKs, just being in the new country is not enough for them to feel they have developed personally; they need to engage more deeply with the local population to achieve this.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopt a “West meets East” mindset and approach to develop an alternative perspective on Zhong-Yong, and then apply this perspective to understand the issue of balancing the top-down and bottom-up processes in strategy making. There are three steps in the process of developing the alternative perspective. First, the authors argue that the essence of “Yin-Yang balancing” is a ratio-based solution to paradoxical balancing, which is in fact equivalent to Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean and compatible with some western management scholars’ approaches to solving paradox. Second, the authors identify a different generic solution to paradoxical balancing implicit in the western management literature. Third, the authors find in the original text of Zhong-Yong equivalent ideas to the identified different generic solution and then propose an alternative perspective on Zhong-Yong that is fundamentally different from the notion of “Yin-Yang balancing.” Findings: Applied to the issue of balancing the top-down and bottom-up processes in strategy making, the new perspective on Zhong-Yong provides us with the following prescriptive insights from the life-wisdom of eastern philosophy: first, top management (e.g. Shun as the sage-king) must listen to various views and opinions also from employees and low-level managers at the bottom of the organization to be better informed about complex issues. Second, top management must analyze the diverse elements of the various views and opinions they collect and synthesize by taking the good from the bad to find smarter solutions and make decisions with better outcomes. Third, abiding by a set of (more or less) cohesive values help top managers be open and receptive to information and insights from low-level organizational members and enhancing unbiased information. Research limitations/implications: This paper is mainly a theoretical perspective. Empirical work is needed to test the prescriptions offered in this paper. Practical implications: Practitioners may learn new perspectives from ancient Chinese philosophies on how to balance.

Configurators support decision-making processes in the sales and engineering phases of a product and bring substantial benefits, such as shorter lead times, fewer errors, increased ability to meet customers’ requirements and more. Developers of configuration systems act as designers, albeit often not recognizing they are performing in a design process. They define the project scope and the distinction between the problem and solution space elucidates the dualistic approach of Design Thinking (DT). DT is a human-centered approach that includes a wide perspective of stakeholders and aims at enhancing human experience and solving complicated problems by exploring both the problem and solution space. However, exploration of the solution space is typically not a big part of configuration projects, where instead the focus is on mapping the existing knowledge to the configurator. Thus, this paper investigates if the use of DT can make the configuration engineers more inclined to develop new and improved product solutions before implementing knowledge into the configurator. Firstly, the paper reviews the DT literature and discusses its potential applications in configuration projects. Secondly, the paper studies three configuration projects in which DT has been applied. Next, the case studies are compared to existing configuration projects described in the literature. The results of analysis showed that the application of DT promoted increased exploration of the solution space and better communication within organization, and that this led to improved product solutions. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.","Configuration; Design thinking; Knowledge management; Problem and solution Space; Scoping","Decision making; Expert systems; Knowledge management; Configuration; Configuration system; Decision making process; Design thinking; Product customization; Scoping; Scoping process; Solution space; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082530079

To overcome the challenges in the new business environment, the companies introduce common products components and variants in order to reduce complexity and improve the performance. Besides, the manufacturers attempt to increase the variety in products and services in response to the personalization demands; which leads to more complexity. However, the companies can improve the due-date setting and resource allocation to optimize internal process performance. This paper describes a design-time estimation model for planning engineering activities based on a quantification of the most important product complexity factors such as: 1) basic components variety, 2) functional requirements, 3) design interdependencies and 4) regulations and standards. Such factors can decrease or increase the expected time consumption for the specification tasks. This paper identifies key factors essential to assessing the expected hours for specific engineering tasks based on a case study and literature review. Qualitative and quantitative information was obtained by means of (i) archival documents, (ii) participant-observations, and (iii) workshops in the case company. These complexity factors are then combined to develop a mathematical design-time estimation model that supports the internal performance optimization in a given engineering design process. Finally, an IT tool is prototyped and tested in an engineering company. In conclusion, the developed model and IT tool assist the case company to improve the estimations for due-date setting and resource allocation to optimize internal process performance. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.","Complexity management; Design-time estimation Model; Engineering design; Quantifying complexity","Competition; Estimation; Resource allocation; Complexity management; Design interdependencies; Design time; Engineering design; Engineering design process; Participant observations; Quantifying complexity; Quantitative information; Product design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082509368

The exploration sets off from the concept of an entry node, i.e. whether network entrance is facilitated by a direct dyadic or an indirect triadic relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is mainly conceptual, but also presents an empirical cross-border actor constellation which highlights the implications of the study. Findings: Bi-directionality implies that value innovation is contingent on the fit between the actors involved in the entry node, not on the fulfilment of the needs of a focal actor. Further, the attractiveness of an entry node depends on network structures, the network positions of the actors in the entry node, the desired outcomes of entry (immersion or reach), and the actual behavior of the actors. The dynamics of transitivity can influence triadic entry nodes. However, transitivity operates differently in business networks than in social networks constituted by inter-personal ties. Therefore, closure of open triadic entry nodes is neither an automatic outcome of strong ties, nor a normatively better outcome. Research limitations/implications: The theorizing offered by this paper must be further explored in different empirical contexts to assess its practical adequacy. Still, the presented empirical case indicates that the expected attractiveness of entry nodes is closely linked to (in)transitivity. Originality/value: The paper supports the relevance of expanding from a dyadic to a network perspective in order to capture the dynamics of value innovation in an international setting. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business networks; Entry nodes; Intermediation; Internationalization; Transitivity; Value innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066868167

Especially, manufacturing industries in developing countries realize the importance of adopting sustainability concepts in their supply chain. The SSCM adoption has not been to the same level across different manufacturing sectors and hence a single implementation framework will not have the same effect across sectors. This paper aims to compare the adoption level of 25 SSCM practices across three major manufacturing sectors, namely, automobile, electronics and textile, in an emerging economy, India. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire-based data collection technique is used to obtain adoption levels of each of the identified SSCM practices on a five-point Likert-type scale with “1” representing not considering presently to “5” indicating successful implementation. Second, a hypothesis is framed and tested to compare the adoption levels across sectors using a one-way single-factor ANOVA followed by a post hoc test by Tukey’s test. Findings: The results derived suggest that though the industries across different sectors are in the course of adopting SSCM practices, the level of adoption is found to be not the same. The textile sector has adopted the least, and the electronic sector edges ahead of the automobile sector in terms of successful transformation to SSCM. Originality/value: This study focuses on the differences and similarities in the adoption of policies in the automobile, electronics and textile sectors using statistical data analysis tools. A total of 25 individual practices are identified from existing literature and classified into six groups, namely, management, supplier, collaboration, design, internal and society, based on their similarities. Based on a detailed questionnaire survey with industrial experts in relevant fields as respondents, the adoption levels of practices are rated individually and categorically. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Empirical study; Environmental management; India; Logistics; SSCM practices; Sustainable supply chain management; Tukey’s test",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073239758

A major challenge with this class of material systems is the accurate placement of a fabric that can be very tacky and hence sticks to the mold surface. In this study, automatic draping of entire plies of woven prepregs is considered. A robot end effector with a grid of actuated grippers is under development and it has the ability to position the plies onto double-curved mold surfaces of low curvature. The key issue is how the grippers of the end effector should move to achieve successful drapings of the plies that meet the quality requirements of the industry. In this study, an approximate ply model based on cables with bending stiffness is applied in an optimization framework where the gripper movements constitute the design variables. The optimization framework has taken inspiration from manual layup procedures. The numerical draping results indicate the usefulness of the cable model used in connection with the optimization framework.

By doing what Donna Haraway calls ‘multispecies storytelling’ research involving humans, dogs, and various animal organisations, we use storytelling to study what we call ‘pet capitalism’. We address the problems of interpreting story fragments in multispecies storytelling conversations in order to explore the Tamara-Land of organisational contexts of animal organisations within pet capitalism. We explore what Linda Hitchin calls ‘untold stories’, such as the euthanasia consequences of pet capitalism. We examine what those untold stories tell us about the animal-human-organisation’s resistance to being researched as pet capitalism. We apply Jean Paul Sartre’s existentialism and Harold Garfinkel’s ethnomethodology to the problem of intersubjectivity. Finally, we discuss implications of our explorations for the intersubjectivity of storytelling conversations which have unstoryable and unnarrativizable aspects of the multispecies storytelling of pet capitalism. © 2019, © 2019 Australian and New Zealand Communication Association.","antenarrative; conversational storytelling; ethnomethodology; Pet capitalism; unnarrativizable; unstoryable",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075397706

Using an Information Processing View, we argue that managing interdependencies between multiple vendors imposes substantial information processing (IP) requirements on clients. To achieve high joint performance, clients therefore need to possess sufficient IP capacity. We examine how three sources of IP capacity, two internal (i.e., the client’s inter-vendor governance and the client’s architectural knowledge) and one external (i.e., the guardian vendor), work together in realizing joint performance. Our results show that formal governance and architectural knowledge contribute to joint performance. The guardian vendor contributes to joint performance in settings where the client deploys strong governance but lacks architectural knowledge. This suggests that, contrary to common views in the literature, guardian vendors should not be understood as mediators (or single points of contact) who relieve clients from governance efforts. Instead, guardian vendors are more fruitfully understood as architects, who complement the client’s governance efforts by compensating for knowledge gaps. Put simply, client firms should consider using a guardian vendor to compensate for weak architectural knowledge while still maintaining strong formal and informal governance of all vendors. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","architectural knowledge; governance; guardian; information processing view; joint performance; multi-sourcing","Electric arc welding; Architectural knowledge; governance; guardian; Joint performance; multi-sourcing; Architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073542534

Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by Mol’s work on care, the paper explores care practices connected to the clinical education of nurses. The empirical data were generated from longitudinal, multi-sited ethnographic fieldwork among nursing students in clinical practice combined with follow-up interviews with the students and their supervisors. Findings: The paper illustrates how three logics of care shape clinical education: the logic of relational care, the logic of care education and the logic of care production. The paper demonstrates how the logics unfold and entangle in everyday clinical education. On the one hand, care of patients based on the relationship between patient and nurse is highly valued. On the other hand, this logic is not institutionalized in the same way as practices induced by the logic of care production and the logic of care education. Originality/value: The paper may be of value to scholars and practitioners in clinical education, as well as to health educational policy makers.

To accomplish this, the article analyzes the Danish Cranet project from its inception in 1991 until today, with particular emphasis on the effort to establish a longitudinally comprehensive Danish database with application in cross-country comparisons, exemplified here through comparisons with New Zealand.

The transformation of this urban wasteland has a long history which is shaped by changes in society, technologies, and consequently in ecologies during different periods reflecting prevailing paradigms of nature perceptions over time. We seek to provide a theoretical frame using the social-ecological-technological systems (SETs) framework and transition theory to describe the transformations of the site from its pre-wasteland stage to rewilding and recreation and lately niche development of urban ecotourism.

Findings: By means of Michael Lipsky’s outline of access regulation, the authors will analyze the following regulatory strategies that are identified during the fieldwork: “Gatekeepers’ sympathy and creaming,” “Queuing and delay,” and ‘Withdrawal of consent and “no resources.” The paper suggests that trust, shared goals and sympathy seem to be key to the process of getting access. Originality/value: Despite principles of neutrality, equal rights and access to services in welfare systems, the authors’ experiences thus tend to support other research within bureaucratic and care organizations, which has found that interpersonal relations, sympathy, dislikes, norms and values, etc., can heavily influence timely access to services, tailored information and support. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accessibility; Bureaucracy; Care values; Multisited ethnography; Policy; Thresholds",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058083930

In the coming years, the importance of edge caching will continue to rise, as the volume of streaming traffic and the number of user requests for video contents are rapidly growing. MEC is gradually becoming the preferred choice for supporting the large-scale network infrastructure and the data intensive applications. MEC is characterized by deploying cache functions at the edge of the network, i.e. close to the end users. The proper deployment of caching functions is essential in the design process. A low-cost and scalable testbed is desired for engineers and researchers in order to verify various advanced MEC technologies.This paper introduces an in-lab testbed of MEC network platform based on the open source OpenAirInterface (OAI) system. Caching functions are implemented on multiple edge devices in the LTE emulation platform. The MEC technology has been evaluated and analyzed with multiple users access. The test results illustrate the MEC benefits including reduced latency for real-time applications, more efficient use of bandwidth and storage resources.

Previous research relates supplier attributes largely to intraorganizational supply chain practices, such as supplier selection and evaluation, and assumes that supplier attributes can be objectively assessed independently of the relationships with suppliers. This study expands on this literature by (1) exploring supplier attributes as perceived by purchasing managers in ongoing buyer–supplier relationships and (2) examining how these perception-based supplier attributes are associated with performance-influencing practices, which can in turn shape relational outcomes of the relationships. In doing so, we combine two exploratory qualitative studies. We conduct 60 repertory grid interviews with purchasing managers in Study 1 and 25 semi-structured interviews with another set of purchasing managers in Study 2. The findings of this study are finally theorized through the supply chain practice view and are summarized into an integrative theoretical model. This study thus provides a more nuanced understanding of perception-based supplier attributes and their implications on performance-influencing practices and relational outcomes in buyer–supplier relationships. © 2019 The Authors.

Evidence indicates that land available for cultivation is allocated unequally across households; and that factor transfers are more common between neighbors, co-ethnics, and kinship-related households. Does this lead to the conclusion that land inequality is due to flows of land between households being impeded by social divisions? To answer this question, a novel methodology that approaches exhaustive data on dyadic flows from an aggregate point of view is introduced. Land transfers lead to a more equal distribution of land and to more comparable factor ratios across households in general. But equalizing transfers of land are not more likely within ethnic or kinship groups. In conclusion, ethnic and kinship divisions do not hinder land and labor transfers in a way that contributes to aggregate factor inequality. Labor transfers do not equilibrate factor ratios across households. But it cannot be ruled out that they serve a beneficial role, for example, to deal with unanticipated health shocks. © 2018 The Author 2018.","allocative efficiency; factor markets; land markets; social networks","agricultural land; allocative efficiency; cultivation; economic analysis; ethnicity; household structure; kinship; land market; social network; Gambia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073367144

Using a rich dataset from Ethiopian manufacturing over the period 1996-2011, I find that most firms rely on production inputs from the world market. These firms are better performing as shown by significant, economically large import premia. I also find strong evidence of self-selection of more productive firms into importing which is indicative of sizable import market entry costs. To examine the causal effect of importing on firm productivity, I use a model in which the static and dynamic effects of importing are separately estimated. The estimation results provide support to learning-by-importing. However, the productivity gains are small in size compared to similar findings in other studies. I provide some evidence in support of firms' limited absorptive capacity in explaining the small productivity gains. © 2017 The Author.","absorptive capacity; Ethiopia; imported inputs; learning-by-importing; self-selection","data set; import; industrial performance; learning; manufacturing; productivity; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073322984

Overfertilization in traditional tea production leads to serious environmental problems. A shift toward organic production and consumption has been enhanced recently as one of the potential solutions to reduce environmental impacts. A life cycle assessment approach was used to assess carbon footprint and primary energy demand for five Chinese organic tea products in this study. Two functional units were chosen: 1 kg of dry tea for cradle to supermarket gate and 1 cup of tea for cradle to grave. Results showed that different farming managements and processing technologies exerted major effects on carbon footprints and primary energy demand of different tea products. Hotspots were identified as cultivation, processing, and packaging for cradle to supermarket gate. However, from a whole life cycle perspective tea consumption was a major hotspot. The most sensitive contributing factors, including the amount of boiling water and carbon emission factors of electricity, had great impacts on the accuracy of the final results. Scenario analysis showed a potential for emission reduction (49–65%) and energy saving (46–66%) by comprehensively using improvement strategies.

Although these retailers are commonly dependent on the intermediaries for trading, there is scarce literature addressing the influence of intermediaries in green supply chain practice. This study explores the repercussions of a dominant intermediary in a three-echelon green supply chain under price and greening level sensitive demand in both single and two-period setting. The results demonstrates that the manufacturer is able to sell maximum amount of products and the retailer receives higher profits if an intermediary dominates the market. A dominant intermediary can urge the manufacturer to promote products with a lower greening level. In such scenario, the unit R&D investment in producing green products is less, but each participant may receive higher profits. A sequential profit-sharing mechanism is proposed from the perspective of the manufacturer that can be employed under leadership of the wholesaler. Under this mechanism, the retailer can maintain strategic inventory, each member can receive higher profits, and most importantly, the manufacturer can promote products at highest greening level to achieve sustainability goals.

This includes documentation of the extent to which programmes are compatible with the basic views of providers and their local practices. The present study explores the Svendborgproject – a programme tripling the amount of physical education in six public schools, sustaining it for 10-years and documenting a decreased incidence of overweight, obesity and cardiovascular risk factors. The aim was to analyse provider and programme characteristics of the Svendborgproject to gain insights into providers motives for adopting, implementing, and maintaining the programme. Six school heads and six teachers were interviewed to explore how they perceived programme compatibility to their school's practice and their own role as providers. Both teachers and school heads found the additional lessons a valuable asset that fitted existing school values and priorities. Additionally, physical education teachers participated in a course providing new perspectives and teaching methods that aided the implementation of the programme. Lastly, school heads stressed that implementation fidelity was heavily dependent on the dedication of physical education teachers and on having simple programme requirements that made it clear what could be expected of the programme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CHAMPS-study DK; Health promotion; Implementation; Qualitative research approaches; School health","education; health care; health services; physical activity; policy implementation; qualitative analysis; research; child; Denmark; health promotion; human; physical education; procedures; program evaluation; school health service; university; Child; Denmark; Faculty; Health Promotion; Humans; Physical Education and Training; Program Evaluation; School Health Services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067801245

Environmental product declarations are one way of incentivizing environmental performance, but with the majority of the water use occurring in primary pig and feed production, methods are required that quantify the water use over the entire value chain. Life Cycle Assessment applies such an approach, and the European Commission's Product Environmental Footprint framework uses this methodology. Product Environmental Footprint studies can use generic data for the pig production and feed cultivation stages and results communicated without uncertainty. Current study aimed to test if using database water footprint inventories could lead to a systematic underestimation of the water use in Danish pork production. A probabilistic surface- and groundwater footprint inventory assessment of the production of 100 g pork in Denmark was carried out. Danish average industry data was used to assess the possible range of water use for domestic Danish processes and FAOSTAT- and Water Footprint Network data for imported feed. Monte Carlo simulations were used to create water footprint inventory intervals, which were compared with intervals for three inventory databases: EcoInvent, Agribalyse, and Agri-footprint. The water footprint inventory intervals for Danish pork ranged from 3.8 to 9.2 L/100 g with a coefficient of variation of 21%. Database values were significantly (p < 0.001) left-shifted by 3.0–3.9 L/100 g and 4.4–6.6 L/100 g with significantly different (p < 0.001) coefficients of variation of 6.4% and 12.3% for Agri-footprint and Agribalyse respectively. This makes using generic data preferable to using primary data for producers with low water efficiency. Instead of demanding primary data, it is recommended that uncertainties in databases capture the observable variability, and that environmental product declaration results must be communicated with their associated uncertainty. This could incentivize provision of primary data and avoid deliberate underestimations of water use. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Environmental product declaration; Life cycle assessment; Product environmental footprint; Uncertainty; Water footprint","Agriculture; Cultivation; Database systems; Environmental management; Groundwater; Intelligent systems; Mammals; Meats; Monte Carlo methods; Environmental footprints; Environmental product declarations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Uncertainty; Water footprint; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067565057

This has led to an increase in the demand for sustainable and biobased products. Paper and paper products are good alternatives to their plastic counterparts. A key element of paper industry is the raw material (wood, bamboo and nonwood agricultural residues such as bagasse, straws etc.) from which pulp is produced. The pulp is then utilized for production of paper. There are many pulping processes to prepare pulp of various qualities. For fine grade pulp, chemical pulping is used. The chemical pulp is produced by soda, kraft and sulphite pulping processes. However, for newsprint grade pulp, stone ground wood (SW), thermomechanical (TMP), chemi-thermomechanical (CTMP), chemi-mechanical (CMP) or refiner mechanical (RMP) corresponding pulping processes are employed. The method of pulp preparation (pulping process) consumes large amount of energy and chemicals. A new pulping process with electron irradiation using biowaste (bagasse) as a raw material is discussed in this work. Bagasse pulping process is found to reduce about 50% of energy consumption during pulping process. The process is referred to as ‘ECTMP’ (Energy Efficient Chemi-Thermo Mechanical Pulping). The paper produced from aforesaid method also reflected no loss of strength properties with respect of TMP reference pulps. Henceforth, preliminary calculation based on experimental results shows that the proposed bagasse ECTMP process explored the scope of energy savings of the order of 50%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biowaste; Chemi-thermomechanical pulping; Chemical impregnation; Energy efficiency; Irradiation","Agricultural wastes; Bagasse; Chemical pulp; Electron irradiation; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Irradiation; Paper and pulp industry; Plastic products; Pulp refining; Thermomechanical pulp; Bio-based products; Bio-waste; Chemi-thermomechanical pulping; Energy efficient; Paper industries; Pulp preparation; Thermo-mechanical; Thermochemical Conversion; Thermomechanical pulping process; Bagasse; Energy Conservation; Paper Industry; Plastics; Pulping; Radiation Effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067426592

We find that group-affiliated bidders have the greatest propensity to finance their investments with stock when taking over firms affiliated with the same business group (within-group acquisitions), followed by standalone firms making acquisitions (standalone acquisitions). Finally, group-affiliated bidders acquiring either standalone firms or firms not affiliated with their group (outside-group acquisitions) have the lowest propensity to finance their investments with stock.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review relevant literature to clarify the role of urban agriculture in sustainable cities. The search for literature was guided by themes such as: a)urban agricultural practices, b)indicators for the measurement of sustainable cities, c)economic, social and environmental benefits of urban agriculture, and d)negative effects of urban agriculture on the city. The results from a synthesis of the literature indicate that urban agriculture supports the economic, social and environmental sustainability of cities. However, if the discussion gives credence to only the economic dimension of sustainability, then urban agriculture loses the debate. This is because the economic benefits of prime city land that is used used for non-agricultural purposes (such as commercial or industrial)is profound. However, the social and environmental functions of responsible urban agriculture, particularly in reducing the rift between urbanisation and nature, may be difficult to quantify. These social and environmental functions underscore the importance of urban agriculture in the city landscape. The paper concludes by arguing that focussing on only economic sustainability in the urban agriculture-sustainable city discourse is a travesty of the idea of sustainable development.

CA-Markov is one of the frequently used methods for this purpose, while a few studies have investigated the possibility of improving it with respect to capturing heterogeneous directional variation of change instead of a global approach. The main objective of this study is to improve the simulation performance of CA-Markov model by developing a direction-based approach so that the predictive changes vary along different directions resulting in more accurate predictions. The proposed approach was tested on Babol city of Iran for three timestamps of 1985, 2001 and 2015. Thereafter, the performance accuracy of the global and direction-based approaches was compared. For doing so, Pearson Chi-square statistic, Shannon's entropy, and degree-of-goodness index were used to check the spatial structure of urban expansion. The findings reveal that our proposed approach outperforms better than the global approach confirming the suitability of our approach for presence and futuristic urban planning. Our conclusions draw attention of the respective stakeholders and decision makers to take our findings into consideration and also take preparedness measures for the speculative consequences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CA-Markov; Direction-based approach; Simulation; Urban expansion","Markov chain; modeling; stakeholder; urban development; urban planning; Babol; Iran; Mazandaran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065144342

By applying a cognitive perspective on entry mode decision making, we propose that the performance of prior international activities influences decision makers’ behavior in different ways than assumed in internalization theory. More specifically, due to a representativeness bias, underperforming (overperforming) past ventures influence the decision to change (continue using) the previous entry mode choice, which may result in an entry mode deviation. In addition, the propensity to deviate from theoretical predictions is stronger when the experience is recent and/or salient due to an availability bias. In conclusion, we argue that internalization theory can benefit from incorporating more systematically important behavioral assumptions on how firms enter international markets. In so doing, we contribute to the recent conversation on how variations in human behavior influence internalization theory. © 2019, Academy of International Business.","bounded rationality; cognitive bias; deviation from prediction; entry mode; internalization theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064676520

A platform's success depends on their engagement in value creation and capture. Prior studies of such engagement have mainly focused on a platform's governance mechanisms without recognizing their interdependence to its technological architecture. There is therefore a limited understanding of how the interplay between governance and architecture configures platform organizations, and why these configurations produce different levels of complementor engagement. In this paper, our analysis of a 12-year study of a shared platform initiative yields three configurations of platform organizations: vertical, horizontal, and modular. Based on these configurations, we develop propositions that theorize the implications of these organizational forms for complementor engagement. We further propose that these insights, which we derive from a shared platform, are particularly relevant for blockchain-based platforms. © 2019 The Authors","Blockchain; Complementor engagement; Governance mechanisms; Platform organizations; Technological architectures","Blockchain; Complementor engagement; Digital platforms; Governance mechanisms; Organizational forms; Technological architectures; Value creation; Architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063761176

Specifically, the approaches differ on the notions of efficiency, opportunism, and level of analysis. We then argue that internalization theory can benefit from the systemic view implied in the GVC approach, and discuss the role of trust as a coordinating mechanism in international business.

We outline different social functions of bullshit focusing on two particular types of managerial practices in which bullshit is likely to play a significant role: commanding and strategizing. On this backdrop, we consider bullshit in terms of the messages, senders and receivers involved, focusing especially on the dynamics between these dimensions in the context of organizations.

Vector autoregression (VAR) is a framework that has been shown to be well suited to predicting for several wind farms simultaneously by considering the spatio-temporal dependencies in their time series. Lasso penalisation yields sparse models and can avoid overfitting the large numbers of coefficients in higher dimensional settings. However, estimation in VAR models usually does not account for changes in the spatio-temporal wind power dynamics that are related to factors such as seasons or wind farm setup changes, for example. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a time-adaptive lasso estimator and an efficient coordinate descent algorithm for updating the VAR model parameters recursively online. The approach shows good abilities to track changes in the multivariate time series dynamics on simulated data. Furthermore, in two case studies it shows clearly better predictive performances than the non-adaptive lasso VAR and univariate autoregression. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters","Energy forecasting; Model selection; Multivariate time series",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045565111

Methodology/approach: From a conceptual point of view, this employee–customer–business results chain is well founded and generally accepted, also in the European Excellence Model. But for many companies, it seems difficult to demonstrate such links, and several issues must be addressed to uncover the links. To investigate these links empirically, a hotel chain provided data matching employee and customer measures with measures of profit, and a modelling approach is developed. Findings: The model is successfully applied. As it is possible to estimate and test the links, we have demonstrated the effects of employee attitudes on customer loyalty and further on business results. The findings provide strong empirical evidence for the developed model, and the study provides evidence of the employee–customer–business results chain. Research limitations: The study is limited to four hotels in Copenhagen, Denmark.

The purpose of this paper is to extend this development and identify how university entrepreneurial ecosystems can be expanded to support communities that are under-represented in entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach: Based on an integrative literature review (Torraco, 2005), this paper draws together and synthesises literature from the field of entrepreneurship, higher education studies and under-represented communities in an integrated fashion, leading to the development of a new conceptual model. Findings: This paper challenges the traditional role of universities in supporting entrepreneurship as focussing mainly on economic growth and new venture creation, and identifies how universities are also positioned to provide greater civic support to entrepreneurial learning amongst under-represented communities. Through a critical analysis of the literature, the conceptual model proposed identifies six key considerations in the expansion of university entrepreneurial ecosystems for under-represented communities. Practical implications: There are currently 96.6m people at risk of poverty and social exclusion in the EU (OECD, 2017) and an estimated 43.1m Americans (US Census Bureau, 2017). This paper explores how university entrepreneurial ecosystems can be expanded to support minority and disadvantaged communities who are under-represented in terms of entrepreneurial activity. Originality/value: Given that there is little research regarding how universities might activate inclusive entrepreneurship initiatives amongst under-represented communities, this paper expands existing knowledge as it identifies the key considerations encompassing university-led community collaborative enterprise support. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Enterprising behaviour; Entrepreneurial ecosystems; Entrepreneurial education; Inclusive entrepreneurship; Public policy; Social inclusion; Under-represented communities; University–community engagement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072117714

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses data collected by an online survey targeting a stratified sample of 1,238 private firms operating in Denmark. The empirical analysis was carried out by estimating a structural equation model. Findings: The key finding was that a decentralized organization (DO) can act as a mediator between a firm’s differentiation strategy and its performance. A multi-group analysis revealed that the mediating impact of decentralizing was affected by contingency factors such as firm size, strategic clarity, degrees of business environment risk and industry competition. Thus, a DO can be said to play a more important role in larger firms, in firms with less strategic clarity, and in companies with multiple plants. Research limitations/implications: Although the study offers empirical evidence from a relatively large and representative sample of firms, the specificity of the context should be noted. In particular, firms in Denmark, while facing strong competition, do not compete with low costs. Clearly, studies of the mediating role of decentralization in low-cost strategy environments would be an important next step. Practical implications: Several implications of the findings for organizational design and creation of beneficial conditions for strategy implementations are discussed. Originality/value: The novel contribution of the study lies in the focus on decentralization as a mediator in the strategy–performance relationship. While previous research has shown that strategy is related to decentralization, and that decentralization is associated with higher performance, an empirical analysis of the relationship between the factors in the strategy-decentralization-performance path had not previously been undertaken. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Contingency; Decentralization; Mediating effects; Performance; Strategic fit; Strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071549483

The shell temperature can reach several hundred Celsius degrees. Therefore, a thermoelectric waste heat recovery system can be utilized based on its advantages. In this study, an arc shaped absorber is designed and temperature distribution along the absorber circumference is obtained numerically. The calculated temperature is considered as the hot side temperature of thermoelectric generators (TEGs) that recover thermal energy on the absorber. In situations where the heat is free, the metric for designing a thermoelectric system is to reach the maximum power output. In order to reach regional optimal power from parametric design, the absorber length is divided into several sections. For efficient design of the TEG in each section, effect of significant parameters such as leg length and fill factor of the TEG and thermal resistance of the heat sink are studied. Effect of variation of the temperature and velocity magnitudes of the air next to the heat sinks is considered on thermal resistance and performance of the pin-fin heat sinks along the absorber. β-phase zinc antimonide (Zn4Sb3) and magnesium tin silicide (Mg2SiSn) are chosen as the p- and n-leg thermoelectric materials of the TEGs, respectively, because of their relatively high performance over the considered range of operating temperature. The results show that, staggered arrangement of the pin-fins is more effective for higher power generation and system performance compared to in-line arrangement of the fins. Moreover, by evaluation of the results, maximum matched power output in each section versus the fill factor and leg length can be determined in this study. The results show that, low fill factors between 0.05 and 0.2 can provide relatively a same maximum power as high fill factors. Furthermore, an economic evaluation is carried out to find optimal design of the TEG device for highest power generation and lowest investment cost. Various parameters of the cost function, such as cost of the bulk raw material (CB), manufacturing cost associated with processing bulk material (CM,B), areal manufacturing cost (CM,A), heat exchanger cost (CH-EX), balance of the system cost (CBoS) and the installation cost (CI) are taken into account in this study.

This paper discusses a methodology to apply PA and Exergy Analysis during design of a new process plant to make it energy efficient, using Diesel Hydrotreating Unit (DHT) as an example. PA has been used to estimate the Minimum Energy Requirement (MER), to select utilities and to design the optimal Heat Exchanger Network (HEN). Exergy Analysis is then performed to pinpoint the sources of energy inefficiency in the whole plant and suggest improvements. The application of these two techniques has helped in energy integration of the plant during the design phase itself. Two common layouts of diesel hydrotreating unit—the ‘hot separator layout’ and the ‘cold separator layout’—have been studied. The minimum Total Annualized Cost (TAC) is ∼7.6 M€/y and ∼10 M€/y for the hot separator layout and the cold separator layout respectively. Exergy destroyed is 27.15 MW (7.9% of exergy input) and 50.18 MW (6.7% of exergy input) respectively for the hot separator layout and the cold separator layout.

Design/methodology/approach: This study addresses low-income consumers, for whom societal arrangements strongly determine service interactions. Qualitative interviews reveal service value processes and outcomes for low-income consumers during acquisition processes. Findings: For low-income consumers, inclusion, status, resource access and emotional relief represent key value outcomes. Important value processes shape those value outcomes, reflecting broader societal arrangements at macro, meso and micro levels. Marketing constitutes an institutional arrangement that establishes an empowered “consumer” role. Value processes are hindered if consumers sense that their agency in this role is diminished, because marketing interactions give precedence to other social roles. Research limitations/implications: Marketing should be studied as an institutional arrangement that shapes value creation processes during acquisition. Micro-level value processes have important implications for service quality and service value. Value outcomes thus might be designed in the acquisition process, not just for the offering. Practical implications: The acquisition process for any good or service should be designed with its own value proposition, separate to the core product or service. Careful design of value processes during acquisition could mitigate conflict between social roles and those of consumption.

This paper aims to present the first extensive multi-level analysis of the relationship between urbanization and energy consumption in ASEAN countries from 1995 to 2013. Design/methodology/approach: The multi-level (across country and sector) index decomposition method is used to analyze urbanization, energy mix, energy intensity and activity effects on energy demand. Urbanization is measured by two representative factors, name the urban population and the number of non-agriculture workers. Findings: Despite the decreasing rate of urbanization, its effect on energy consumption has played the most important role since 2000. Since then, the effect has continued to increase at the national and sectoral levels across the whole region. The strongest urbanization impacts are encountered in the residential sector, followed by transportation and industrial sectors with much weaker effects in the commercial sector. The way in which urbanization impacts energy consumption depends strongly on the income level of the country studied. Practical implications: The results provide quantitative relationships between urbanization and energy demand. For example, if the urban population and the non-agriculture workers decreased by 0.1 per cent per year, this would reduce energy demand by 1.4 per cent and 2.6 per cent per year respectively.

Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on a qualitative multiple-case study of operation and maintenance activities in offshore wind parks, starting in June 2014 with a pilot qualitative case study and the main qualitative multiple-case research conducted via in-depth interviews with 20 enterprises. The preliminary findings were presented for the qualitative triangulation of comments in a seminar in May 2015. Findings: The findings explain the need for collaboration across the business network through the use of an open innovation platform for orchestrating dynamic signature capabilities in combination with ordinary capabilities. Both locally distributed leadership and central leadership in knowledge creation are necessary ingredients. The model developed from the research findings shows the need to change the competitive advantage criteria within business networks to VRIS (valuable, rare, imitable, substitutable) in contrast to the traditional criteria for individual enterprises of VRIN (valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, non-substitutable). Research limitations/implications: The research is focused on offshore wind park business networks, and therefore, the generalizability of this qualitative case study to other contexts can be limited. Further research is thus needed to verify the findings.

We introduce a previously unexamined key moderator that takes account of the observer perspective: the benefits sought in the context of a complainant–brand interaction (e.g., brand presences in social media). Hence, we differentiate hedonic from utilitarian contexts and we note the distinct observer benefits and corresponding preferences. A field study and a series of experiments show that a defensive response can be superior in hedonic contexts but inferior in utilitarian ones.

It focuses on whether gender diversity influences men and women’s management aspirations. Design/methodology/approach: The study builds on cross-sectional survey data from the Danish public sector. Findings: Results shows that in mixed-gender workplaces, male employees are less likely to express management aspirations than male employees in mono-gender workplaces, but female employees in mixed-gender workplaces express management aspirations to the same – low – degree as female employees in mono-gender workplaces. All in all, the findings show that gender differences in career aspirations are not just a matter of individual preferences and/or macro-structural factors but also a matter of factors at organizational level. The findings suggest both positive and negative implications of gender diversity, and hence problematize a – rather common – simplistic celebration of gender diversity. First of all, gender diversity seems to counteract the fertilization of rigid stereotypes of men and hence prevents some men from being pushed into management positions and a career ladder they perhaps do not want to be placed at in the first place. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications: The findings seem to identify that the challenge of secure a large and qualified pool of potential managers might be even extra challeging for managers in gender-diverse organisations. Originality/value: A more nuanced view of the implications of gender diversity based on a basic argument of gender-asymmetry. Furthermore, the study are build on a unique dataset that allows to study the implications of gender diversity across a wide range of occupational setting and hence control for occupation specific characteristics. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gender asymmetry; Gender diversity among peers; Gender stereotyping; Management aspirations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071673933

Knowledge on implementing screening tools for preventing readmissions in emergency department (ED), where the primary focus is often the present-day flow of patients, is scant. The purpose of this paper is to explore whether a new screening tool for predicting readmissions and functional decline in medical patients>65 years of age could be implemented and its influence on cross-continuum collaborations between the primary and secondary sectors. Design/methodology/approach: The study took place in an ED in Denmark, in collaboration with the surrounding municipalities. An evaluation workshop with nurses and leaders from the ED and the surrounding municipalities took place with the aim of investigating the organizational changes that occurred in daily practice after the implementation of the screening tool. The workshop was designed and analyzed using cultural historical activity theory (CHAT). Findings: The results showed that it was possible to develop collaboration between the two sectors during the test period. However, the screening tool created different transformations for the municipality employees and in the ED. The contradictions indicated that the screening tool did not mediate a general and sustained transformation in the cross-continuum collaboration. Research limitations/implications: Screening tools are not objective, neutral or “acontexual” artifacts and must always be adapted to the local context and sectors. CHAT offers a perspective to understand the collective object when working with organizational transformations and implementation. Practical implications: The study have shown that screening tools are not objective, neutral or “acontexual” artifacts and must always be adapted to the local context. This is called adaption process. This adaption requires time and resources that should be taken into consideration from the beginning of introduction of new screens. Originality/value: This paper contributes with knowledge about CHAT which offers a way to understand the leading collective object when working with organizational transformations and implementation. CHAT focuses not only on the structural changes but also on the cultural aspects of organizational changes, which is important if we want to reach a sustained change and implement the new screening tool in different sectors. © 2019, Jeanette Kirk, Ove Andersen and Janne Petersen.","Activity system analysis; Cross-continuum collaborations; Culture; Implementation; Screening","adult; article; artifact; Denmark; emergency ward; employee; hospital readmission; human; leadership; nurse; system analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069538334

It is generally accepted that new product introductions are essential to the health of food companies. Yet, many believe that most new products fail, therefore discouraging companies to introduce some new products. However, most of the estimates suggesting high failure rates are either anecdotal or qualitative. This article provides a quantitative approach to measuring new product success rates for food products and to show the relationship between the success of new product and entry strategies. This article uses a quantitative approach to measuring product success/failure exclusively for food products. The authors contend that failure rates for food products are not nearly as low, and success rates much higher than it was previously established in the literature and perceived by the industry professionals. There was a significant variability of success rates between various food groups ranging from 58% for both fruit and vegetables and desserts and ice-cream categories to 88% for baby food. Success rates also varied among the different introductory strategies of the new food products, ranging from 50% for new packaging to 75% for re-launch strategies. Academics and practitioners usually quote very low success rates for new products based on subjective and/or strictly qualitative information. This empirical quantitative research shows that success rates for food products are much higher than previously reported. This should encourage greater use of new products to grow sales and profits. The previously reported low success rate may have led to the reluctance to introduce new products and therefore set many of the legacy food companies in their current poor financial condition. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","failure rate; food; launch strategies; New product; product categories; success rate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073944107

The aim is to address how failures and defects are produced and handled in the social practices of construction projects and specially to scrutinize the unintended consequences of both structured and chaotic problem solving. The argument is based on a longitudinal ethnographic study of a dwelling project, encompassing just over 100 days of fieldwork. Structuration theory was applied to understand the interrelations between project actors and structures in the handling and redressing of quality issues and to elucidate unintended consequences of the practices. The analytical strategy was abductive, allowing theory and empirical material to inform each other. Two cases were selected; the well-structured process of erecting concrete panels and the chaotic processes of building a penthouse. The results show how routine and experience are helpful, but also how they maintain an “acceptable” level of defects, which should change the widespread appreciation of experience as being positive for building quality. The unintended consequences of routinized practices are corroborated by the lack of knowledge sharing beyond the project. Both reactive and proactive problem-solving practices are important, but the reactive tend to dominate. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The collaborative turn in public value theory shows how public managers may mobilize the knowledge, ideas and resources of users, citizens and organized stakeholders, but it has so far neglected the role of elected politicians who tend to be reduced to a legitimizing sounding board for public managers aiming to advance public value creation in collaboration with a plethora of public and private actors. This paper seeks to compensate this benign neglect by advancing a new notion of ‘interactive political leadership’. This new construct aims to conceptualize the way that elected politicians may develop new and better policy solutions through a problem-focused interaction with relevant and affected actors from the economy and civil society, including users, volunteers, citizens and other lay actors. The theoretical argument about the development of interactive political leadership, which takes us beyond the traditional forms of sovereign political leadership that perceives politicians as ‘elected kings’, is illustrated by empirical examples drawn from local, national and supranation levels of government. © 2019 by the authors.

The establishment of new hybrid architectures such as meshed offshore grids, directly connecting offshore wind farms to interconnectors, potentially contributes to taking full advantage of future grid expansions. However, the fact that each country designed their power systems decades ago when regional coordination was not in focus, can potentially destabilise joint efforts if the benefit of the new hybrid infrastructure is not represented also at a national level. In this paper we assess the impact of wind development in the region in a radial vs. hybrid scenario depending on the budget available for the expansion. Furthermore, we identify the specific challenges relative to investment cost distribution and analyse several regulatory frameworks that mitigate the ripple effect of the investment decisions of each country. Finally, we formulate policy recommendations to overcome the investment barrier and suplport coordination in joint regional grid investment. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Budget control; Commerce; Electric power system interconnection; Expansion; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Power markets; Grid expansions; Hybrid architectures; Investment costs; Investment decisions; Policy recommendations; Regional coordination; Regulatory frameworks; Renewable energy capacity; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076747516

In particular, a peer-To-peer (P2P) electricity market is an attractive framework to allow direct transactions between prosumers. However, this may raise several challenges in the operation and management of the distribution grid. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is the design of P2P electricity markets taking into account grid characteristics while solving potential congestion and voltage problems. The paper proposes a coordination methodology between P2P markets and distribution system operator (DSO) allocating a grid tariff to the prosumers that cause grid limit violations. Such tariff is defined based on the euclidean distance among trading prosumers, which is implemented in the P2P market through product differentiation approach. The proposed methodology is compared to a benchmark model in a representative distribution grid with 138 nodes and 109 prosumers. An important conclusion is that the proposed methodology is capable of achieving a trade-off between prosumers P2P transactions and grid operation. © 2019 IEEE.","Consumer-centric electricity market; Coordinating approach; Grid operation; Peer-To-peer energy trading; Prosumer","Economic and social effects; Electric industry; Energy resources; Peer to peer networks; Power markets; Consumer-centric; Coordinating approach; Energy trading; Grid operation; Prosumer; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076675147

Our results provide support for the hypothesis that information constraints at the time of target valuation are associated with greater overpayment and weaker post-acquisition performance. Prior ties between firms are found to reduce information constraints to acquiring managers, and thereby reduce overpayment and increase post-acquisition performance. Bids by other potential acquirers are found to signal their private information about the target, providing a substitute for lacking information. This effect holds particularly for non-financial data, which are harder to obtain. These findings suggest that overpayment and underperformance can be prevented not only when an acquirer possesses more information, but also when in the absence of needed information, the presence of rival bidders signals their private information about the value of the target. © 2019, American Accounting Association.

But interdisciplinary integration can be challenging to achieve in practice. Scientists with different disciplinary backgrounds often have different views on what count as good data, good evidence, a good model, or a good explanation. Accordingly, several scholars have reported on challenges encountered in interdisciplinary settings. This chapter outlines how some of the challenges play out in systems biology where disciplinary ideals and domainspecific practices sometime collide. We focus on tensions arising due to differences in epistemic standards between modellers with a background in physics or systems engineering, on one hand, and experimenters with a background in molecular biology on the other. We propose that part of the problem of interdisciplinary integration can be understood as the result of unfounded “disciplinary imperialism” on both sides, in which standards from one discipline are uncritically applied to new domains without recognition of other valid or complementary perspectives. Addressing and explicating the disciplinary background for the different views can help facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration in science and improve science education. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","disciplinary imperialism; epistemic standards; interdisciplinarity; systems biology; systems science","Molecular biology; Systems science; disciplinary imperialism; Domain specific; Good data; Interdisciplinarity; Interdisciplinary collaborations; Science education; Systems biology; Integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074832715

In comparison, local entrants develop such capabilities more slowly, but within a broader range of value chain activities and with higher spillovers of skills and knowledge, as well as higher participation to building a local entrepreneurial ecosystem. I propose that these effects are moderated by the size of national consumer markets as well as industry context in the guise of project lengths and technological modularity. I also point to the role of global connectivity, proposing that local entrants, in particular, leverage international personal relationships for development of not only relational, but also production capabilities.

First, we offer a systematic review of the current literature on guanxi, especially by differentiating guan dyads from xi networks. This reconceptualization of guanxi enables us to clarify the concept of guanxi by differentiating its two dimensions. Second, based on this literature review, we propose a redirection of future research on guanxi such that guan dyads and xi networks are not examined in isolation; rather, their holistic and dynamic interaction is the most fruitful avenue for future research, especially the four mechanisms of their interaction.

The study investigates EV integration pathways with different degrees of flexibility provided by the charging schemes passive charging (PC), Grid-To-Vehicle (G2V) and Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) in the energy system model Balmorel. While PC yields in the largest annualized system cost, V2G can achieve considerable savings. Smart charging schemes reduces electricity price variability considerably compared to PC. Further, investments in additional battery storage systems are delayed using G2V until 2050 whereas PC have significantly larger requirements already decades before. The flexible charging schemes have subsequently positive effects on emission reduction. Allowing the model to use the foresight mode and taking into account future developments earlier reduces the system cost of all scenarios. While V2G still is the cheapest option, it however, is considerably small in the improvements which shows a certain robustness whereas PC gains relatively more by being able to adjusting earlier for the substantial peak demand requirements. © 2019 IEEE.","Energy market design; Flexibility; Internal energy market/system integration; Market integration of renewable energy sources","Commerce; Emission control; Integration; Investments; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Battery storage system; Energy market designs; Flexibility; Grid to vehicle (G2V); Internal energy market; Market integration; Variable renewable energies; Vehicle to Grid (V2G); Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071566584

However, founders find that the management of existing operations competes with the attention that they can devote to innovation. We investigate whether and how establishing a middle management level frees up attention for innovation when firms are newly started. We argue that middle management is positively related to introducing product innovations and that the effect is stronger when founders have larger stocks of pre-existing knowledge and when the startup's industry provides more innovation opportunities. These hypotheses are supported by an analysis of 2,431 German high-tech startups founded between 2005 and 2012. Managerial Summary: Most high-tech entrepreneurs acknowledge that an overload of managerial tasks keeps them from advancing innovation in their startups. However, they are often times reluctant to introduce middle management because of a fear that the resulting bureaucratization will stifle innovation. Our study shows that these fears are not justified. Instead, we find for 2,431 high-tech startups in Germany that startups with middle managers are significantly more innovative than those without. While middle managers might be a roadblock for innovation in large firms, startups benefit from having them.

Using aggregated data from three countries (the UK, Italy, and Austria), and a mixed-methods approach, the study investigates which rhetorical strategies are used to construct ex-post legitimation or delegitimation of the changes, and how these strategies are associated with different perceived outcomes of change. Building on previous literature, possible strategies for ex-post (de-)legitimation and outcomes of change are identified. The study finds that radical change (leading to new accounting systems bedding down with accompanying new interpretative schemes) is associated with ex-post legitimation based on rationalization. In contrast, incremental change (introducing new accounting tools, but not resulting in changed interpretative schemes) is often connected with narratives criticizing (or delegitimating) the change. The study contributes to the scant body of literature focusing on ex-post legitimation of accounting change. How managers justify change in relation to its outcomes provides useful insights for the current situation when, as a consequence of crisis and austerity, new roles and relevancies for accounting and control systems continue to emerge. It is argued that for change to be substantive, it is not only essential that the actual systems and structures of accounting are adjusted, but it is critical that the way people interpret and make sense of accounting information (and consequently take decisions) is also modified. The particular challenges of achieving this in a period of crisis are highlighted. © 2019 Accounting Foundation, The University of Sydney","Accounting change; Central government; Ex-post legitimation; Mixed methods; Outcomes of change; Public sector accounting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070757510

It analyses how decision rights transform and affect managerial action and argue that functionalist approaches to organising a company through RA principles are inexpedient. The argument is based on two spaces related to decision-making and managerial action – physical space and virtual space – and addresses the managerial effects of RA with respect to these spaces. The RA literature argues that the design of RA should be based on its context and its structure should be stable. However, the study presented here shows how the effects of RA emerge in a process of development and transformation of the organisation. When an organisation and its management control system cannot embrace the dynamism of the physical space, the resulting managerial actions and decision-making are tumultuous; accountability in this context means possessing ‘a counter-ability’, not being ‘accountable’. Accounting forms a virtual organisational space, and the relationships between physical and virtual spaces co-construct the organisational effects of RA. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Accountability; Decision rights; Managerial action; Performance; Responsibility accounting; Virtual space",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069632394

The increasing use of ICTs in social interactions has facilitated informal ways of organizing and affected the participation, emergence, and organizing of conflictual and consensual collective actions. In this study we seek to understand how the integrated use of multiple ICTs, that is the ICT ensemble, affects the organizing of consensual collective action. We investigated the ICT ensembles used by two civic movements that successfully organized large-scale consensual collective action events in two European countries. In our results, we reveal how ICT ensembles constrained and facilitated the organizing functions and requirements of collective action. The findings show that ICTs allow organizers to operate purposefully in order to organize collective action, but the extent to which they succeed in the actual concretization of collective action actually depends on their capacities and intents. Therefore, we argue that human factors (that is, their resourcefulness and agency) are greatly implicated in the success of collective action supported by ICTs. This study extends the research on impact of technology-enabled collective action by looking at the combined use of multiple ICTs and examining the rare and overlooked phenomenon of consensual collective action. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Consensus movements; Human agency; ICT ensembles; Information and communication technology; Mass collaboration; Organizing collective action",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067842172

Climate-related effects are particularly observable in the Greenlandic tourism sector—which is a designated future key industry. Responding to these changes requires planned efforts for the various tourist seasons. To date, studies investigating how West Greenlandic winter tourism may be affected by Arctic warming remain sparse. Therefore, we used the regional climate model HIRHAM5 at a 5.5 km horizontal resolution for the RCP 8.5 scenario and two time slices (2031–2050 and 2081–2100), relative to the modelled historical period (1991–2010) to characterize the consequences of business-as-usual warming on recreational winter activities (i.e., resort skiing, ski-touring, heli-skiing, cross-country skiing, dog sledding, snowmobiling and trophy hunting). Study locations included Nuuk, Ilulissat, Sisimiut and Kangerlussuaq. Model data provide strong evidence for increasing annual mean temperature (between 1.1 °C and 4.6 °C) and precipitation (between 1% and 78%) in West Greenland until 2100, compared to 1991–2010. According to our results, snowfall and snow cover season length decrease (between 34% to 42% and 21% to 49%, respectively) in the long run. Resort skiing and cross-country skiing are affected by snow marginality and wet snow conditions, while ski-touring and heli-skiing demonstrate a higher adaptive capacity (i.e., translocation to snow safe destinations). A reduced snow cover thickness particularly threatens dog sledding. In-depth interviews were conducted with two local stakeholders working in winter tourism. Their perspectives suggested that they will be challenged adapting outdoor recreation by middle and end of the twenty-first century. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Greenland; HIRHAM5; Potential consequences; Winter tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067621054

The faster a company adapts, the more quickly that company can outpace its competitors, and a new approach that is attracting attention is called Online to Offline (O2O).

We demonstrate that the best outcome and the highest profit is achieved with the O2O deterministic demand under the quantity flexibility agreement. However, the stochastic demand case attains the same result.

Although MNCs are increasingly exposed to appropriability risks from these policies, how they respond is relatively understudied in international business (IB) research. We explore this topic based upon a survey and interviews with Western MNCs doing business in China, as well as a discussion about the recent US-China trade war. We find that, as traditional IB theory would predict, internally-oriented strategies (e.g., internalization, maintenance of informal intellectual property (IP), and control of technological centrality and sophistication) are often used to respond to FTT policies; however, the risks from such policies can sometimes be more efficiently managed by externally-oriented strategies (e.g., non-market activities and reliance on formal IP). We discuss how the co-evolution of MNCs' risk management strategies alongside changing value chains, IP institutions, and conditions determining the leverage of FTT policies appear to contribute to this phenomenon. We argue that IB research should more prominently recognize the role of externally-oriented strategies, not only internally-oriented ones, in managing the complex IP-related institutional challenges present in emerging markets today. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Externally-oriented strategies; Forced technology transfer policies; Global value chains; Institutional theory; Intellectual property; Internally-oriented strategies; MNCs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066245713

Coined approximately 30 years ago, it was adopted by the International Academy for Production Engineering (CIRP, from the French title), which established annual conferences on life cycle engineering to further develop the concept and its operationalisation. With the recent advent of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), engineering is now provided with specific targets to steer societies towards sustainable production and consumption. But how can LCE contribute to meeting the UN SDGs? Here, we report on a consultation process conducted as part of the 25th CIRP LCE conference, organised in Copenhagen, DK, in 2018. Approximately 175 participants reflected on a list of ten pre-identified challenges for implementing the SDG agenda that LCE could help tackle, and were solicited to propose solutions. A total of 118 solutions were proposed, and the main messages and recommendations are summarised and reported in the paper. Overall, they voice the need for stronger action from academia (e.g. research needs related to addressing trade-offs across SDGs), business and governments (e.g. transparent and harmonised reporting on sustainability performances, internalisation of external costs) and society at large (e.g. consumer behaviour, role of education). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Absolute sustainability; Interactive session; Life cycle assessment; Manufacturing; SDG; Sustainable production and consumption","Artificial life; Economic and social effects; Manufacture; Planning; Sustainable development; Consultation process; Interactive session; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle engineering; Life cycle perspectives; Manufacturing activities; Sustainability performance; Sustainable production; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065735230

The affective constitution of digital organization is a process of affective intensification that not only works like an economy but is directly productive of economic value, and not only involves human emotionality but technological affectivity as well.

In five of the six cases studied, articles exhibiting a European context are strikingly similar in content, with the British case as the exception. However, coverage of British euroscepticism drives Europeanization in other member states.

Existing research on the topic primarily focuses on how team gender diversity influences scholarly productivity in terms of citations and publication rates. Far less attention has been devoted to the question of how the intellectual contents of research disciplines change as they become more gender diverse. Drawing on a global sample of more than 25,000 management papers, we use natural language processing techniques, correspondence analysis and regression models to illuminate impact-, content- and status-related dimensions of gender diversity in management research. In regression models adjusting for geographical setting, institutional prestige and collaboration patterns, we find no discernable effects of team gender diversity on per-paper scientific impact. In contrast, our analyses converge to yield a broadly consistent pattern of gender-related variations in research focus: women are well-represented in social- and human-centered areas of management, while men comprise the vast majority in areas addressing more technical and operational aspects. Our findings corroborate recent sociological research suggesting that cultural norms and expectations are channeling women and men towards different areas of work and study. We argue that the broadened repertoire of perspectives, values and questions resulting from gender diversity may render management research more responsive to the full gamut of societal needs and expectations. © 2019","Bibliometrics; Citations; Gender diversity; Management research; Research outcomes; Research questions; Topic modeling","Regression analysis; Bibliometrics; Citations; Gender diversity; Management research; Research outcome; Research questions; Topic Modeling; Natural language processing systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064327247

Consequently, publishers have revised their business models and integrated pay-per-article options. To reduce pre-purchase uncertainty, consumers can use information from firm-induced (e.g., newsletters), or consumer-induced communication (e.g., likes). These communication activities avoid purchases with poor fit but also increase customer expectations. Consequently, their effect on sales, returns, and profitability is unclear. For digital products, these effects are even less clear because product quality is difficult to evaluate pre-purchase, and products can be returned at almost no cost, even after consumption. In this study, we investigate the effects of firm- and consumer-induced communication on digital returns in the context of news articles on a major online platform (Blendle). We rely on a multi-equation model to quantify the effect of firm- and consumer-induced communication activities (i.e., newsletter promotions sent out by the platform and consumer likes from readers) on sales and returns and calculate their profitability impact. Our results show that newsletters decrease returns but do not significantly affect sales. In contrast, consumer likes have a twofold effect by increasing sales and decreasing returns. A simulation shows that both newsletters and likes increase profitability and that likes have a higher potential. Our results offer much needed guidance for online aggregators of digital products (e.g., audiobooks, e-books or news articles), as well as for online publishers based on pay-per-unit business models. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Consumer likes; Digital business model; Digital product returns; News media; Paid content; Profitability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060469351

This form of expert advisory work has become highly controversial, and is increasingly classified as a form of professional wrongdoing. Building on theories of institutional work and categorization, the study theorizes practitioners’ responses to field-level legitimacy threats. Specifically, the article models a process in which misconduct is recategorized in terms of the core norms that underpin professional legitimacy. Through this process, practitioners create institutional change by altering the way they see themselves and their work, transforming the ‘vice’ of tax avoidance into the professional ‘virtues’ of public service and expert neutrality. This model advances knowledge compared to previous research on professional misconduct, which was situated primarily at the organization level, and responds to calls for analysis of ‘agentic self-categorization’ processes in creating the micro-foundations for legitimacy in the professions. © The Author(s) 2018.","category work; institutional theory; professional misconduct; tax avoidance","article; avoidance behavior; drawing; human; human experiment; job market; morality; occupation; physician; professional misconduct",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059627186

However, it is unclear whether this is based on mere proximity or other unobserved factors. We extend this literature by developing a framework to examine in what way institutions promote open innovation processes between clustered firms. Specifically, we develop a set of hypotheses to investigate to what extent structural and relational elements in a cluster organization affect the open innovation culture. Our model integrates effects of agglomeration, networks, information asymmetries and trust on open innovation culture. We focus on the underlying organizational norms established in clustered firms in relation to open innovation. Specifically, we measure open innovation culture in terms of not-invented- and not-sold-here syndromes, which is facilitated by the integration of trust and reduced by information asymmetry within the cluster region. We test this framework using novel and unique data from member and non-member firms of a cluster initiative in a German high-tech cluster. Our findings from moderation analysis show that a regulatory body in the cluster significantly influences the emergence of both inbound and outbound open innovation activities by member firms in the cluster initiative through increased effects of trust and information asymmetries.

While previous literature has primarily addressed auditing's ability to prevent corruption, this paper systematically explores auditing's potential to detect corruption. It argues that financial auditing has excluded corruption from the definition of fraud and instead classified it as ‘non-compliance with laws and regulations’. The main arguments for this exclusion is that corruption leaves no material errors in financial statements and no evidence for the auditor to follow. The paper refutes this, arguing that commercial and political corruption creates misstatements in the financial statements of the corruption giver's organization as well as the corruption receiver's organization. Thus, if auditing is to gain a more prominent role in the fight against corruption, auditing standards must include corruption in the definition of fraud, private and public sector auditors need to cooperate and exchange information, auditing techniques to detect corruption should be employed, and the auditing profession must embrace effective preventive measures such as anti-corruption certifications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Accounting; Auditing; Bribery; Corruption; Expectation gap; IFAC",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048518883

We present an inductive case study of a particular regional ecosystem and focus on the inter-organizational collaboration between SMEs and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. With this focus, we explore how SMEs perceive, organize, and manage open innovation through strong collaborative ties with other ecosystem members. We identify a particular set of challenges for the SMEs due to the misalignment between their business model and that of their ecosystem. Specific findings include the link between innovation type expressed by diverging understandings of the notion of innovation across the ecosystem and the innovation form (here, open innovation), which should be organized and managed on multiple levels of analysis (SME, inter-organizational, and ecosystem).

This is unfortunate given the evidence suggesting growing numbers of female entrepreneurs with strong international orientation. Thus, this study aims to provide a better understanding of the experiences and practices of women entrepreneurs with regard to EPPs. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on personal interviews with eight female-owned international entrepreneurial ventures in the fashion design industry in Denmark. A qualitative research design was used to explore the experiences of the women entrepreneurs regarding different types of EPPs and their various providers, and the data were analysed and interpreted using the NVivo software program. Findings: The results show that while the level of awareness of EPPs was generally high, the programs were overwhelmingly perceived to be overly expensive, excessively time-consuming, insufficiently specific and largely irrelevant. When the women business owners had availed themselves of their services, the usefulness of the EPPs was deemed to be largely imperceptible. Plausible explanations for these results may be found in the gendered entrepreneurial literature. The study’s findings provide important gendered insights to government support agencies charged with promoting the internationalisation of female-owned small businesses. Originality/value: This study presents novel gendered findings of the experiences of female entrepreneurs regarding the role played by EPPs in the growth of their firms on international markets.

However, phosphorus utilisation efficiencies in most countries are below 20%, making the implementation of suitable phosphorus recovering technologies urgent and necessary. In spite of intensive research and development, there are only a few commercial recovery facilities being implemented. Therefore, there is a need to identify potential roadblocks/hurdles in a systematic manner. To this end, technology readiness level, process economics and sensitivity analyses were novelly integrated and employed to evaluate the opportunities and hurdles during the implementation of current phosphorus recovery technologies. The enhanced methodology is demonstrated via a case study, revealing that only struvite crystallization is sufficiently mature to be industrially implemented. Under most scenarios evaluated, struvite crystallization can be profitable or break-even if financial assistance is provided from policy-makers. Sensitivity analysis showed that overall profitability is highly sensitive to raw materials cost and product sale price, while phosphorus concentration in waste streams has less effect. Such an assessment could be extended to identify barriers in other resource recovery technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Net present value; Phosphorus recovery; Sensitivity analysis; Struvite crystallization; Technical readiness level","Phosphorus; Profitability; Recovery; Financial assistance; Net present value; Phosphorus concentration; Phosphorus recovery; Raw materials costs; Readiness levels; Struvites; Technology readiness levels; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065826128

Accordingly, both practices are crucial to achieve professional improvement in the environmental performance of these organisations. However, research on the relationship of GSCM, green innovation, and environmental performance is relatively rare. Therefore, this study is aimed to provide empirical evidence showing that GSCM and green innovation practices significantly improve environmental performance in order to encourage organisations to implement these practices. In addition, this study investigates the relationship between GSCM and green innovation practices and the influence of these practices on the environmental performance in 123 manufacturing organisations with ISO 14001 certification. The results of PLS-SEM revealed that there is a significant and positive relationship between GSCM and green innovation, and the environmental performance. Moreover, green innovation had a positive effect on the environmental performance. Furthermore, green innovation had a mediating relationship between GSCM and environmental performance. Therefore, the present paper confirmed the significant influence of GSCM on boosting the green innovation of organisations and on the manufacturing establishments, which eventually improve the environment.

However, reporting on sustainability does not ensure the factual application of sustainable practices. It is possible that companies with risky practices increase their sustainability reporting as a window dressing measure, but also that sustainability reporting improves transparency and thus, decreases company risk. Our research is motivated by the conundrum that the reciprocal effects between risk and reporting are not yet fully understood. Therefore, this study explored the bidirectional relationship between sustainability disclosure and risk. The study investigated 59 listed companies from South Africa between 2012 and 2016. Environmental, social, and governmental scores were used to assess the effect of sustainability disclosure on total, systematic, and idiosyncratic risk. Fixed effects panel regressions, statistical modelling, and Granger causality tests were employed for the investigation. Analysis revealed that sustainability disclosure in general—and disclosure on social sustainability issues in particular—reduce systematic risk in subsequent periods. Additionally, other uni- and bidirectional effects were uncovered, suggesting that higher total risk, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk nudge companies to report more on social issues in subsequent periods. At the same time, tentative evidence could be found that higher systematic risk leads to less disclosure on governance issues. Overall, disaggregating sustainability disclosure into environmental, social, and governance issues helps getting a fine-grained understanding of its bidirectional relationships with total risk, systematic risk, and idiosyncratic risk. Managers benefit from these insights by better understanding how sustainable practices and disclosing information on them can improve the market's assessment of a company's systematic risk. Investors and regulators can learn from this study which reporting strategies managers typically choose as a response to changing risk perceptions in the market. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ESG scores; Idiosyncratic risk; Market risk; South Africa; Sustainability disclosure; Systematic risk; Total risk; Volatility","Commerce; Investments; Managers; Risk assessment; Risk perception; ESG scores; Market risks; South Africa; Sustainability disclosures; Systematic risk; Volatility; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065402881

Design/methodology/approach: The integrated discovery approach presented in this work is aimed to mine: control, data and resource perspectives within one process diagram, and, if possible, construct a hierarchy of subprocesses improving the model readability. The proposed approach is defined as a sequence of steps, performed to discover a model, containing various perspectives and presenting a holistic view of a process. This approach was implemented within an open-source process mining framework called ProM and proved its applicability for the analysis of real-life event logs. Findings: This paper shows that the proposed integrated approach can be applied to real-life event logs of information systems from different domains. The multi-perspective process diagrams obtained within the approach are of good quality and better than models discovered using a technique that does not consider hierarchy. Moreover, due to the decomposition methods applied, the proposed approach can deal with large event logs, which cannot be handled by methods that do not use decomposition. Originality/value: The paper consolidates various process mining techniques, which were never integrated before and presents a novel approach for the discovery of multi-perspective hierarchical BPMN models.

Concern has arisen about divergence between this policy discourse and the language and concerns of scientists. This interview study, carried out in Denmark with a cohort of highly internationalised natural scientists, explores how researchers talk about integrity and good science. It finds, first, that these scientists were largely unaware of the Danish Code of Conduct for Responsible Conduct of Research and indifferent towards the value of such codes; second, that they presented an image of good science as nuanced and thereby as difficult to manage through abstracted, principle-based codes; and third, that they repeatedly pointed to systemic issues both as triggering misconduct and as ethical problems in and of themselves. Research integrity is framed as a part of wider moves to ‘responsibilise’ science; understood in these terms, resistance to codes of conduct and the representation of integrity as a problem of science as a whole can be seen as a rejection of a neoliberal individualisation of responsibility. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Ethics; Misconduct; Research integrity; Responsibility; RRI","classification; cohort analysis; Denmark; ethics; female; human; male; medical ethics; personnel; psychology; qualitative research; research ethics; scientific misconduct; Codes of Ethics; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Ethics, Professional; Ethics, Research; Female; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Research Personnel; Scientific Misconduct",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053852369

We engaged in a three-fold research endeavour to address these questions. Firstly, we conducted an in-depth literature review, mapping the emergence and developments of the circular economy concept in time and space with a specific focus on urban studies. Secondly, we analysed documented translations of the circular economy imaginary in three European metropolitan cities (Amsterdam, Paris and London)to explore the discourses, institutions, representations and social identities underpinning their respective translations, and reflect on how they diverge from each other and how they have the potential to deliver sustainable outcomes. Thirdly, these results were used to outline a research agenda that explores the relationship between the political and the epistemic domain of existing urban translations of circular economy across scales and places, to support future empirical investigations of whether and how circular economy imaginaries can support transformative pathways for socially inclusive and environmentally desirable value creation in cities. In so doing, this paper fosters reflexivity for both theory and practice in order to better understand how theorisations and the application of circular economy could be advanced in support of urban sustainability transitions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Co-production; Europe; Geographies of transition; Governance; Socio-technical imaginaries; Urban sustainability transitions","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Co-production; Europe; Geographies of transition; Governance; Imaginaries; Urban sustainability; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065507263

The combination of increased urbanization and rising sea levels makes it a concern of increasing societal importance. This study offers a new perspective on environmental impact assessment of flood related repairs related to a single-family residence using life cycle assessment. A typical European house built in the 2010's is modelled in the life cycle assessment framework with focus on items damaged by a flood. Flood damage is assessed on the detail level of the house's different components using flood depth as the indicator of damage level. A life cycle inventory is built individually for each considered item group affected by flooding. The influence of flood depths and house ages are studied. The results show that the main impacts of flood related repairs come from the replacement of the wooden flooring, the water heater and furniture. Overall, flood related repairs add between 3.5 and 17.8% of environmental impacts to the life cycle of the house depending on house age and flood depth; deeper water and bad timing in relation to maintenance cycles causing more impacts. Moreover, a very high positive correlation between environmental and economic impact is found in most impact categories. © 2019","Flood; Flood repairs; LCA; Life cycle assessment; Residential","Artificial life; Damage detection; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Floods; Heating; Houses; Sea level; Damage level; Environmental and economic impacts; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Maintenance cycles; Positive correlations; Residential; Wooden flooring; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065499804

Subcritical watertechnology was performed to pretreat the residual biomass. For this process, the reactorwas feed with 5 g of açai residue and a solvent to biomass mass ratio of 80 g of water per gram of açai residue was used. The process was carried out at 170 and 200 °C, during 20 min, using water flow of 20 mL min−1 (15 Mpa system). Then, the residual biomass was submitted to the anaerobic digestion process using a reactor with pretreatment (integration)and a control reactor, both in semi-continuous regime and under mesophilic conditions (35 °C). The açai stone had a high carbohydrate concentration including 43.81% cellulose and 25.89% hemicellulose. For the evaluated conditions, subcritical water pretreatment at 200 °C gave the bestresultsforyield of reducing sugars, total reducing sugars and monosaccharide concentration. Anaerobic digestion experiments resulted in analkalinity between 150 and 1537 mgCaCO3.L−1 for the control reactor and between 249 and 491 mgCaCO3.L−1 for the reactor integration.Acetic acid was the main volatile fatty acid produced in both reactors, but butyric acid also had a very high concentration in the control reactor. The methane composition in the biogas for the integration reactor in the stabilization phase was between 60 and 80%, whilefor the control reactor it was in the range between 40 and 60%.The accumulated biogas yield was 7.79 and 791.81 L.KgTVS−1 for the control and integration reactor, respectively.

The shirt was developed through a series of design workshops for the fashion brand Fashion Alpha. Findings: The analysis highlights multiple challenges emerging when a fashion product with a significantly extended lifecycle passes through different users, organisations and business models. It is concluded that it is difficult to talk about a circular business model (singular) as circular economy solutions depend on the contributions of multiple stakeholders with business models. Practical implications: The findings illustrate how fashion companies interested in the circular economy fundamentally have to rethink conventional approaches to value, organisational boundaries and temporality. Originality/value: Drawing on a case example from the fashion industry, the paper demonstrates the organisational complexities linked to the design of new business models based on circular economy thinking, as these require the coordination of actions between autonomous actors driven by different logics regarding value creation, value delivery and value capture. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business models; Circular economy; Service shirt; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067061811

The liminal condition of multiple identity positions enables our informant to experiment with and integrate several parallel identity narratives as he tries on socio-political constructions of ‘the entrepreneur’ for size; and it is the permanence of the liminal condition that makes emotional reflexivity necessary so he can handle the constant lack he experiences. The contribution of our work lies in exploring how the operation of the discourse of enterprise never closes on the centre of subjectivity that is imputed in that discourse, and how our subject, through emotional reflexivity, deals with this fundamental lack. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","discourse; identity; politics","development discourse; entrepreneur; political ideology; psychology; research work",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063930200

Based on a sociological standpoint, an exercise intervention with middle-aged women is analysed through empirical material from observation (N = 57), focus groups (N = 51) and individual follow-up interviews (N = 21). The article finds that spinning is a highly routinized and structured activity that entails a prevailing health-promoting control of the emotions to complete and a scarcity of emotional excitement. The article concludes that the biomedical perspective involves a rationalization of leisure time that excludes the emotional excitement usually associated with sports. The emotional body should not be neglected when the (in)active body is problematized in public health.

Because businesses’ expectations about PPP outcomes affect how and whether they participate as partners, managing PPPs effectively requires knowing not just what governments lose or gain, but also the value businesses receive. This article demonstrates how structural, collaborative, and participant factors associated with both public and private partners affect business value in PPPs. Based on a mixed-methods approach, this study tests four hypotheses on how PPPs influence value creation for businesses. The findings show that PPP experience, trust, and size have significant effects on business value. However, they only increase certain types of value, depending on the presence and performance of other factors. Moreover, the results show that businesses gain more intangible values, such as network development and knowledge, than revenue. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046732843

The purpose of this paper is to examine how players’ achievement orientation, social orientation and sense of community contribute to willingness to pay (WtP). Design/methodology/approach: A multi-method study of an online game community is used. Interviews and participant observation are used to develop an understanding of social and achievement orientations followed by the development of hypotheses that are tested using survey data. Findings: The findings indicate that a sense of community is positively related to WtP, whereas satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the service provider is not. The authors examine the moderating role of players’ achievement orientation and social orientation and find that while a stronger connection to the community may encourage achievement-oriented players to pay, the opposite is indicated for socially oriented players. Practical implications: Decision makers need to understand that not all players are potential payers; while socially oriented users can help to maintain and grow the community, achievement-oriented players are more likely to pay for the value they extract from the community. Originality/value: While communities are held together by people with common interests, which intuitively suggests that WtP increases with the strength of connection to the community, the authors find this only applies in the case of players with an achievement orientation. For those with a social orientation, WtP may actually decrease as their connection to the community increases. These perhaps counter-intuitive findings constitute a novel contribution of value for both theory and practice. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Achievement orientation; Mixed methods; Monetization; Online games; Social orientation","Decision making; Surveys; Achievement orientations; Design/methodology/approach; Mixed method; Monetization; On-line games; Participant observations; Theory and practice; Willingness to pay; Social networking (online)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070313780

Design/methodology/approach: Separate interview questionnaires for 3DP users and 3DP service providers were used to conduct semi-structured interviews. Findings: The key 3DP adoption challenges are as follows: creating a business case; difficulty in using different materials; optimising the process for specific parts; lack of “plug and play” solutions offered by equipment manufacturers; limited availability of training and educational support; poor end product quality; machine breakdowns; and high cost of maintenance and spare components. Using the theoretical lens of the technology acceptance model, results show a lack of ease of use and technological turbulence impact companies’ decisions to adopt 3DP. 3DP service providers can indeed attempt to alleviate the above challenges faced by customers through providing multiple 3DP services across different stages of adoption. Research limitations/implications: Future research should examine the role of 3DP equipment manufacturers and design and modeling software solutions providers in improving adoption and how 3DP equipment manufacturers could develop into more integrated service providers as the technology advances.

Yet, past research has been held back by the lack of a rigorous measurement instrument. Rather than defining social entrepreneurship as an organizational form that a venture does or does not have, this paper agrees with Dees and Anderson (2006) that the construct is better thought of as a set of practices, processes and behaviors that organizations can engage in to a higher or a lesser degree. In other words, the construct is a set of behaviors that any organization can engage in. The purpose of the paper is to develop scale items to measure the construct of organizational social entrepreneurship (OSE). Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on previous literature, this paper first develops and then validates scales for measuring OSE as a third-order formative construct. As its second order, the scale includes three components that capture the heterogeneity of the OSE concept: social change intention, commercial activity and inclusive governance. Findings: The OSE scale is developed and tested through a sample of 182 nascent social enterprises from 55 different countries in the world and then revalidated using a second sample of 263 mature social enterprises from 6 European countries. Results suggest that the scale items exhibit internal consistency, reliability, construct validity and nomological validity. Research limitations/implications: The scale presented here offers an important new venue for social entrepreneurship theorizing. First, it allows scholars to take a broad approach toward a diverse field and to study OSE behavior in any empirical field in which it may occur. Second, the scales also allow for more focused theorizing. Scholars are encouraged to delve into the antecedents of all three components presented here and to study the different performance effects they have in terms of likelihood to survive, growth rate or potential to achieve financial sustainability. Originality/value: The paper develops a multidimensional construct for OSE. In particular, the authors propose scale items for three central components of social entrepreneurship, namely, social change intentions, commercial activities and inclusive governance. The scales thus measure the three formative dimensions identified by Dees and Anderson (2006) and Defourny and Nyssens (2010). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commercial activities; Inclusive governance; Scale; Social change intention; Social entrepreneurship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066023297

This paper aims to critically strengthen social impact measurement as a process by ascertaining epistemic gaps in the methodology of a dominant measure, based on an exploratory case study of a social enterprise supporting immigrant women in Sweden. Design/methodology/approach: The author undertook participant observation and informal interviews with managers at Yalla Trappan – a women’s cooperative social enterprise in Malmö, Sweden – for the integration of long-term unemployed, immigrant women into the labour market. Through an interpretivist framework, themes of “social sustainability” and “feminist economics” formed a theoretical inquiry for data collection within the organisation and resulting in a critical discussion of the social return on investment (SROI) method. Findings: The case study of women’s cooperative social enterprise is seen to challenge some systemic assumptions made by the SROI metric through its validation of knowledges and economic principles which are congruent with feminist epistemologies. The relationship between social and work life is re-configured by the organisation for the specific features of its beneficiary group (in which gender is a determining factor), with implications for intergenerational cohesion, past trauma resolution and positive postpartum practices that present challenges to a SROI measurement process. Originality/value: This study applies a distinctive disciplinary understanding of feminist economics and epistemologies onto the relatively new field of social sustainability and innovation, illustrating its critique through the impact on practical steps that may be taken in the process of a dominant social impact measure (SROI). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Feminist economics; Feminist epistemology; Social enterprise; Social sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065966547

The focus is on the challenges of allocating the taxing right to payments for cloud computing provided as a service in the form of Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and Software-as-a-Service, deployed as both public and private cloud computing. More specifically, the focus is on mixed contracts, the distinction between business income and royalties and whether the provision of such services constitute a permanent establishment. The analysis is primarily based on the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, but some relevant derogations and national practices are also considered. Among other things, it is concluded that the user jurisdictions, pursuant to the current international tax regime, will, under certain circumstances, be precluded from taxing the income of foreign cloud computing service providers, as cloud computing service providers may be able to deliver their digital services from remote locations while structuring their business around potential withholding taxes. Against this background, value creation and the fundamental principles of legal certainty, neutrality and the ability to pay tax are discussed. Finally, it is recommended that policymakers assess the full effects of the changes made in the tenth update to the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (21 November 2017) before introducing new measures. © 2019 International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD).

Based on this logic, we suggest that low and high levels of regulatory competitive constraints are associated with greater subsidiary external embeddedness. We also suggest that this U-shaped relationship is more pronounced for subsidiaries that are centers of excellence within the multinational enterprise because these subsidiaries heavily depend on the local context as a source of their competitive advantage over their sister subsidiaries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Center of excellence; External business embeddedness; Factors market; Foreign subsidiary; Institutions","Competition; Societies and institutions; Business networks; Center of excellence; Centers of excellence; Competitive advantage; Embeddedness; Foreign subsidiaries; Multinational enterprise; Transaction cost economics; Costs; business development; complementarity; market system; regulatory framework; service sector; subsidy system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070094402

Since location seems to matter in HHW collection activities, it is important to consider pro-environmental spatial spillovers that occur, based on agency actions and waste collection behavior taking place in other locations. These may influence HHW-related practices in close-by regions. Using a county-level spatio-temporal dataset that consists of economic, demographic, and HHW data in California from 2004 to 2015, we evaluate the impact of HHW grants on HHW collection activities while considering pro-environmental spillovers. We employ a research design that controls for confounding factors across the North, Central and South Regions, and over time. The research models assess causal relationships using a random effects panel data model with instrumental variables to estimate the grants’ influences, while considering spatial effects and unobservable bias. Several findings were obtained: (1) HHW grants had positive effects on waste collection in a consistent way across multiple models that we tested; (2) positive spatial spillover effects occurred for HHW collection activities due to the pro-environmental activities of nearby counties. This research contributes to the growing body of research on geospatial policy analytics, ways to establish the basis for causal inference, and the use of robustness checks to develop a deeper understanding of how to make waste management grant programs more effective in the regions where they are implemented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Causal inference; Decision bias; Empirical research; Environmental policy; Geospatial policy analytics; HHW grants; Household hazardous waste (HHW); Modeling robustness; Policy analytics; Policy-making; Pro-environmental spillovers; Recycling; Spatial analytics; Sustainability; Waste management","decision analysis; domestic waste; environmental policy; hazardous waste; policy making; research work; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; sustainability; waste disposal; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068484059

In a study using unique data on 1807 professional relationships in a US-headquartered multinational consulting firm, we find that executives expect less help from outside contacts. This result is partially mediated by trust. Also, relational duration mitigates expectations for help from outsiders. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that executives expect less help from nonlocal contacts. Yet a test of nonlocal professional contacts reveals that geographic distance rather than cultural distance, affects the expectations for help.

This paper aims to pinpoint and understand the drivers that influence individuals’ travel decisions when using travel apps including both travel information and persuasive features. The analytical framework relies on Lindenberg's goal-framing theory in which individuals’ motives for using travel apps are grouped into three overarching goals, namely (1) gain, (2) hedonic and (3) normative goal-frames. Furthermore, technophile attitude, community trust and place attachment are incorporated into the framework in order to better explain user-sided heterogeneity. The case-study focuses on the travel information system under development in Copenhagen (Denmark). It questions 822 Danish travelers by distributing a technology-use preference survey. Structural equation models revealed that the choice motivators are specific to individual users and depend on wide ranging factors that go beyond traditional economic and socio-demographic methods. The study reveals: (i) trip efficiency improvement, enjoyment, social interaction and environmentally-friendly travel promotion are important motives for using the new app; (ii) individuals have different intentions according to the perceived value of the new information system as well as travel purposes; (iii) technophile attitude exerts a positive influence on both user motives and use intention; (iv) social and institutional trust in addition to an affective bond to the city influence the use intention of the travel app. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ATIS; Behavior change; Goal-framing theory; Structural equation; Travel information","Behavioral research; Information systems; Information use; ATIS; Behavior change; Goal-framing theory; Structural equations; Travel information; Advanced traveler information systems; Advanced Traveler Information System; analytical framework; preference behavior; regression analysis; travel behavior; urban transport; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066981367

We review the longevity and heterogeneity of governmental actors along with, and in relation to, the evolving role and place of business and civil society actors under the double challenge of privatization and globalization over the last three to four decades. In so doing we track the evolution of government’s primary governance roles. We suggest that part of the organization and management scholarship builds upon problematic assumptions when it comes to the role(s) of government in the governance of business conduct. We suggest that while governments might be losing some power, they are also acquiring and deploying it in other areas; that governments are taking on new governance roles in relation to business conduct; that government regulation may contribute positively to the governance of business conduct; and that government is an ever-important focus for management and organizational research. We show how the six contributing papers to the Special Issue both illustrate these arguments and reveal new roles for government in the contemporary governance of business conduct. We end by proposing a research agenda for the further exploration of government in governance. © The Author(s) 2019.","business conduct; CSR (corporate social responsibility); governance; government; law; private regulation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066934460

This research describes how the potential for a circular economy in open economies can be estimated by using different assessment methods. Methods and indicators have been selected that have a relevance for one or more of the public policy objectives for circular economy: Openness Index, economic structure, Balassa Index, value chain analysis, substitution potential of Sustainable Materials Management (SMM)strategies, waste treatment scenarios based on physical and hybrid Input-Output (IO)analysis. These methods differ in scope and degrees of complexity and are used at different assessment levels. The potential for a circular economy in this paper is assessed by evaluating the contribution to the public policy objectives for CE: resource efficiency, reduction of dependency on materials, competitiveness, creation of domestic jobs, reduced Greenhouse Gas (GHG)emissions. Results obtained by these methods are shown for Belgium and, in some cases, compared to the results of other countries to illustrate the differences between economies. CE activities (in response to public policy objectives)will enhance the ongoing trend of reducing the share of primary sectors in economies. The openness of an economy is expressed as the ratio of sum of import and export and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Imported products add to the potential of domestic closed-loop circular initiatives like re-use, repair, remanufacture, recycling, but this will require knowledge about composition and spare part availability. Exported products are no longer available for these domestic CE initiatives, reducing the domestic potential for CE and the domestic export activity is vulnerable to CE activities abroad. Especially the increasing geographical distance in trade complicates the practical and legal barriers to close the loop. In open economies, both global and domestic substitution effects due to new circular economy policy initiatives are important to consider. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Physical and hybrid IO analysis; Re-Use; Recycling","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid materials; Public policy; Recycling; Rhenium compounds; Waste treatment; Circular economy; Degrees of complexity; Gross domestic products; I-o analysis; Resource efficiencies; Substitution effect; Sustainable materials; Value chain analysis; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066021174

Various products and processes involve the use of inorganic substances, such as inorganic salts, acids, and bases. However, except selected metal ions, inorganic substances are currently not included in any existing chemical toxicity characterization framework, leaving an important gap unaddressed in current assessments of environmental performance of products and services, chemical substitution, and substance prioritization. To address this gap, we provide initial guidance for identifying and characterizing toxicity-related impacts of currently unconsidered inorganic substances. Starting from a chemical classification of inorganic substances, we determine both the economic and environmental relevance of inorganic compounds currently registered under the European REACH regulation, and combine both to identify substances that should be prioritized for future toxicity characterization. Further, we provide an overview of current challenges and outline possible ways forward toward incorporating inorganic substances into toxicity characterization models. We identified approximately 90 inorganic priority substances that are both of high economic as well as of high environmental relevance. Current characterization methods need to be adapted and extended to account for the complex reaction chemistry and data limitations for effect quantification of inorganic substances. Future research is required that targets the inorganic reaction chemistries and that overcomes current data limitations. This will ultimately lead to a more comprehensive decision support in line with the global sustainability agenda set for chemicals management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental fate; Human and ecosystem exposure; Inorganics; Life cycle impact assessment; Toxicity effects","Consumer products; Decision support systems; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Industrial emissions; Inorganic compounds; Life cycle; Metal ions; Metals; Sustainable development; Toxicity; Characterization methods; Chemical classification; Decision support framework; Environmental fate; Environmental performance; Human and ecosystem exposure; Inorganics; Life cycle impact assessment; Inorganic chemicals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066020395

However, previous studies assume that the market demand is deterministic or has a certain probability distribution. Taking a new approach, this paper analytically addresses the coordination of an SC under a scenario-based demand and proposes an adjustable bi-level wholesale price contract. To analyse the coordination problem under a scenario-based demand, we focus on corporate social responsibility (CSR) investment as an important decision in the SC context and consider a three-tier SC (one manufacturer, one distributor, and one retailer) where the retailer faces a scenario-based stochastic CSR-sensitive demand. Considering a manufacturer-Stackelberg game model, the manufacturer as a leader determines the amount of investment in the CSR issues and the retailer as a follower decides on the order quantity by considering possible demand scenarios. First, we propose the decentralized and centralized decision-making models using a scenario-based approach. Afterward, to resolve the channel conflict in each possible demand scenario, an adjustable bi-level wholesale contract is proposed to entice all SC actors to take part in the coordination scheme. Moreover, a profit-sharing plan is developed based on the Nash-bargaining model to fairly share the extra profits among SC actors. Finally, in order to analyse the efficacy of proposed models, a numerical example and a set of sensitivity analyses are carried out. The results indicate that the proposed contract not only coordinates the three-level SC under a scenario-based stochastic demand, but also improves the CSR level in comparison with the decentralized structure. © 2019","Adjustable bi-level wholesale price contract; Channel coordination; Corporate social responsibility; Scenario-based stochastic demand; Three-echelon supply chain","Decision making; Manufacture; Numerical methods; Probability distributions; Profitability; Sales; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Wages; Channel coordination; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Stochastic demand; Three-echelon; Wholesale price contract; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065046273

Integrating price fairness theory and the concept of cannibalization, three experimental studies reveal detrimental effects of free-to-fee switches on fairness perceptions, attitude toward the company, and purchase intentions, which may partly be attenuated by a freemium switch. Furthermore, we examine different levels of feature reduction as a way for improving the effectiveness of free-to-fee switches.

However, studies of this interrelationship are scarce, have yielded mixed results, and have failed to unveil the mechanisms behind the effects of different types of proximity and their links with tie formation. This paper investigates the roles of geographical proximity and industry proximity with a focus on competitors. It examines the interplay of these two types of proximity in the context of relationships in the shipping industry. Based on a quantitative case study, I find that geographical proximity is not a prerequisite for relationship formation. On average, shipbrokers are more likely to enter into new deals with counterparties external to the industry than with shipping parties or competitors. However, geographical proximity positively moderates the likelihood of dealing with competitors. I explain this on the basis of coopetition, simultaneous competition, and cooperation among firms within local clusters. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Competition; Coopetition; Proximity; Relationship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064529679

Findings suggest understanding CBP as a recurring, multi-level process, making it more than just a corporate-level marketing activity.

Surprisingly, little is known about the relationship between FLEs’ coworker-directed and customer-directed behaviors in product-service systems settings. This research addresses this void and serves two purposes. First, drawing on role balance theory, the authors develop and test a model of an FLE’s relative emphasis on serving coworkers (i.e., helping) relative to the emphasis on serving business customers (i.e., proactive selling) as well as the antecedents and consequences of customer-coworker (im)balance. Second, the authors propose that managers can influence antecedents and consequences through an incentive system and access to information sources, respectively. Multivariate time-lagged analyses using survey and secondary performance data reveal that customer-coworker balance is beneficial for an FLE’s performance, especially when leveraging their coworkers as a prime information source. Interestingly, the increasingly damaging impact of an imbalance toward customer-directed behaviors can be countered by using the information technology (IT) system. Also of interest is that managers can correct imbalance—caused by either work group identification or expected customer demand—via individual-based incentives. © The Author(s) 2019.","coworker-directed behaviors; customer-directed behaviors; frontline employees; product-service solutions; role balance theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063330162

However, this relationship has often been called into question. Past work has not conclusively proven that more accurate demand forecasts lead to higher revenue, causing researchers and practitioners to debate whether the concept of demand forecast accuracy itself is “myth or reality.” In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to consistently link demand forecast accuracy to airline revenue. After discussing why traditional demand forecast error metrics have struggled to demonstrate this relationship, we evaluate a novel conditional demand forecast error metric which compares demand forecasts to historical bookings conditional on the set of fare classes that were open at the time of booking. We prove under some mild assumptions that minimizing conditional demand forecast error will maximize revenue under any fare structure and customer choice behavior. These theoretical findings are supported by simulations in both a simple, single-leg model and in a complex multiple-airline network in the Passenger Origin–Destination Simulator. We find that price elasticity parameter bias of ± 10% can reduce revenues by up to about 1%, while price elasticity parameter bias of ± 20% can reduce revenues by up to 4%.

Furthermore, it is analysed how firms' marketing capability mediates these relationships. For this, a unique environment in post-sanctions Iran is chosen. By using the original survey data from 107 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), our results confirm that durable relationships that a company builds with its customers over the time enhance the market information within firms. This, in turn, enables firms to respond faster to market changes with innovative products and services. Furthermore, the lifetime relationship with the customers enhances the awareness of firms about customers' needs and demands in a timely manner. Accordingly, it accelerates the process of responding the customers' requirements before competitors can catch up. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","customer capital; customer response speed; economic sanctions; Firm innovativeness; marketing capability; SMEs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056833868

It reports on data collected from ‘ethnographic interviews’ conducted in 16 Danish households and suggests that drawing on insights from institutional theory could enrich our understanding of social practices, for example, in relation to the emergence and embedding of new practices and shedding of ‘old’ ones. In addition to highlighting the elements of practice previously identified as integral to collective conventions and connections among different domains of practice, this article recognises the importance of phenomena usually examined in work emphasising institutional analysis. It suggests that policy interventions need to recognise various kinds of institutional rules and processes which confer legitimacy to emerging practices, to facilitate their sedimentation and contribute to realising environmentally sustainable systems and societies. © The Author(s) 2017.","Behaviour; discourse institutionalism; energy-efficient lighting; social practices; sustainable consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055657500

The point of departure is the discussion on the crisis of the university and the apparent lack in this discussion of reflections on the one thing that has historically made the university an important social institution: its capacity to prepare students for employment. The argument in the article is that higher education is determined by the convergence of three tendencies. First, the tendency that the university is losing its purpose, which is caused by an academic bias against employability and a managerial focus on administrative goals. Second, the tendency that academic ethos rather than academic skills is becoming central for future employability in higher education. Third, the tendency that the barriers of entry to the market for higher education are being reduced due to the digitalisation and liberalisation of higher education. My diagnosis suggests that the convergence of these three tendencies is very likely to result in a disruptive scenario for the university. The enquiry combines two analysis strategies of futures studies: diagnosis of the times and construction of future scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Academic ethos; Diagnosis of times; Employability; Future scenario; University","employment; future prospect; higher education; student; university sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048500425

However, headquarters involvement might not always be desired or needed, and it can thus be perceived as interference with local activities, potentially reducing local willingness to go the extra mile. We address the lack of knowledge about subsidiary manager behavior by answering the following question: How does headquarters involvement influence the proactive behavior of subsidiary managers to push for new and innovative ideas? Using data from 120 top managers in subsidiaries of multinational corporations, we find that the negative relationship between headquarters involvement and their subsidiary managers' support for initiatives can be reduced when socialization mechanisms such as a common corporate culture or rotation programs are put in place. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Entrepreneurial behaviors; Headquarters involvement; MNC; Socialization; Subsidiary initiatives","Enterprise resource planning; Finance; Corporate culture; Entrepreneurial behavior; Headquarters involvement; Innovative ideas; Multi-national corporations; Proactive behavior; Socialization; Subsidiary initiatives; Managers; entrepreneur; innovation; multinational enterprise; technological change; technological development; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048219432

We focus on the conflicts between family blockholders and two groups of financial institutional investors – banks and mutual funds. We hypothesize that different types of blockholders have heterogeneous preferences with respect to the CBA decision and outcomes. We suggest that the PP conflicts in CBA differ across the blockholders. Banks are pressure sensitive and cooperative with the management because of their clientele relationship with firms, while mutual funds are subject to more financial scrutiny and independent from the management, making them pressure resistant. When in conflict with more powerful family blockholders, mutual funds will choose to exit after a CBA decision, whereas banks are more likely to stay. With an equally distributed voting power, family and mutual fund blockholders will be more motivated to monitor over each other and jointly discipline the management, leading to more careful selection of CBAs and higher overall shareholder value. However, such effects are weak in the case of family and banks. We find support for these conjectures using data on CBAs undertaken by US public firms over the period 2003–2016. © 2017","Blockholders; Cross-border mergers and acquisitions; Principal-principal conflicts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042675812

However, in 2013, a lockout without any prior strike or strike-warning in the bargaining area for primary and lower secondary education only, came to an end through legislative intervention. The article includes three main arguments. First, the government and the public employers took these drastic steps because various factors created a rare ‘window of opportunity’ for them. Second, the reason a Norwegian industrial conflict in 2014 with a very similar point of departure ended very differently was first and foremost that the Norwegian process was not embedded in politics and policy reform to the same extent as the Danish process.

In order to scrutinise this assumption, this article proposes a set of concepts to study the dynamics of transformative social innovation and underlying processes of multi-actor (dis)empowerment. First, the concept of transformative social innovation is unpacked by proposing four foundational concepts to help distinguish between different pertinent ‘shades’ of change and innovation: 1) social innovation, (2) system innovation, (3) game-changers, and (4) narratives of change. These concepts, invoking insights from transitions studies and social innovations literature, are used to construct a conceptual account of how transformative social innovation emerges as a co-evolutionary interaction between diverse shades of change and innovation. Second, the paper critically discusses the dialectic nature of multi-actor (dis)empowerment that underlies such processes of change and innovation. The paper then demonstrates how the conceptualisations are applied to three empirical case-studies of transformative social innovation: Impact Hub, Time Banks and Credit Unions. In the conclusion we synthesise how the concepts and the empirical examples help to understand contemporary shifts in societal power relations and the changing role of the welfare state. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Empowerment; Governance; Societal challenges; Transformative change; Transformative social innovation","Technological forecasting; Empowerment; Governance; Social innovations; Societal challenges; Transformative change; empowerment; governance approach; innovation; power relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030531895

The analysis is based on a quantitative survey of 505 Danish consumers and a choice experiment involving beef salami. Data were analyzed in a principal component and a latent class analysis. We identify five consumer segments whose preferences for organic and local product attributes differed substantially.

The authors focus on the causes, prevention and management of fit-dependent expatriate crises. Design/methodology/approach: The authors develop a conceptual framework of fit-dependent expatriate crises that involves different levels of analysis. Findings: The conceptual framework shows that crises can be triggered at micro, meso and macro levels ranging from the personal and family domains (micro), to the network and organisational domains (meso) as well as the host country domain (macro). The authors conceptualise these “domains of causes” as triggering maladjustment and acculturation stress that ultimately leads to a severe crisis event with correspondingly serious and potentially life-changing consequences. Furthermore, using a process perspective, the authors outline strategies for preventing and managing crises before, during and after the crisis occurs, discussing the support roles of various internal (organisational) and external (specialist) stakeholders. Originality/value: Studying the link between expatriation and crises is a highly relevant research endeavour because severe crisis events will impact on HRM policies, processes and procedures for dealing with employees living abroad, and will create additional challenges for HRM beyond what could normally be expected. Using attribution theory to explain why organisational support and intervention to assist expatriates during a crisis is not always forthcoming, and theories of social networks to elucidate the “first responder” roles of various support actors, the authors contribute to the expatriate literature by opening up the field to a better understanding of the dark side of expatriation that includes crisis definition, prevention, management and solutions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Abuse; Alcohol; Crisis; Expatriate; Expatriation; HRM role; Law enforcement; Stakeholders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069001105

This study applies a scenario-based dynamic material flow analysis to quantify the stocks and flows along the anthropogenic aluminum cycle in China from 1950 to 2100. Potential future changes of significant parameters are explored and identified, and around 250 sets of scenario results (including all flows, stocks, and losses along the aluminum cycle in China) are obtained for the comprehensive scenario analysis. The main findings include: (1) China's primary aluminum production will peak at around 30 MMT (million metric tons) at around 2025, leading to the end of primary aluminum boom that started from the early 1990s; (2) Domestic aluminum demand will continue to increase to more than 40 MMT due to the growing accumulation of in-use stocks in meeting future societal needs; (3) China's old aluminum scrap generation will increase dramatically (around 0.7 MMT per year) soon and secondary production will account for more than 60% of aluminum production after 2050s in almost all scenarios. Thus, there will be a rapid shifting in production capacity from primary to secondary routes. In this context, the corresponding policy should focus more on the urban mining, and improvement of end-of-life management systems and sorting technologies. These scenario results also reveal key opportunities and barriers in the process. Notably, it becomes increasingly important for China's and the global aluminum industry to investigate China's future role in the global market of primary and waste aluminum products. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminum cycle; China; Industrial ecology; Material flow analysis; Scenario analysis; Urban mining","Aluminum; Aluminum metallography; Aluminum metallurgy; International trade; Aluminum production; China; End of life managements; Industrial ecology; Material flow analysis; Production capacity; Scenario analysis; Secondary production; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064403020

The study combines a technology acceptance model, innovation diffusion theory and risk theory. It develops this model in a smart home applications context. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on an online survey consisting of 409 participants, and the data are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings: Each theory provides unique insights into technology acceptance and numerous constructs are interrelated. Predictors from innovation diffusion and risk theory often display indirect effects through technology acceptance variables. The study identifies risk perception as a major inhibitor of use intention, mediated through perceived usefulness. Results reveal that the most important determinants of use intention are compatibility and usefulness of the application. Research limitations/implications: Studies which do not examine different theories together may not be able to detect the indirect effects of some predictors and could falsely conclude that these predictors do no matter.

Companies that provide customised products increasingly apply configurators in support of sales and design activities, reaping benefits that include shorter lead times, improved quality of specifications and products, and lower overall product costs. The design and implementation of configurators are a challenging task that calls for scientifically based modelling techniques to support the formal representation of configurator knowledge. Even though extant literature has shown the importance of formal modelling techniques, the impact of utilising these techniques remains relatively unknown. Therefore, this article studies three main areas: (1) the impact of using modelling techniques based on Unified Modelling Language (UML), in which the phenomenon model and information model are considered visually, (2) non-UML-based modelling techniques, in which only the phenomenon model is considered and (3) non-formal modelling techniques. This study analyses the impact to companies from increased availability of product knowledge and improved control of product variants. The methodology employed is an exploratory survey, followed by interviews with 18 manufacturing companies providing customised products. The results indicate that companies using UML-based modelling techniques tend to have improved documentation of their product knowledge and an improved ability to reduce the number of product variants. This paper contributes to an increased understanding of what companies can gain from using more formalised modelling techniques in configurator projects, and under what circumstances they should be used. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","documentation; information systems; knowledge management; object-oriented modelling; product configurators; product-modelling","Information systems; Knowledge management; System program documentation; Unified Modeling Language; Design and implementations; Formal representations; Information Modeling; Manufacturing companies; Modelling techniques; Object oriented modelling; product configurators; Product modelling; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042230030

Design/methodology/approach: Two cases were constructed from two studies in Denmark, theoretically inspired by Bourdieu’s concepts of doxa and position and analyzed with focus on the involvement of relatives from the perspective of professionals. Findings: Support to relatives in practice is rarely included in the way that treatment and care are organized in healthcare. Professionals’ views of the involvement of relatives were characterized by the values of neoliberal ideology and medical-professional rationality, in which relatives are not regarded as a subject of care and support in clinical practice. The involvement of relatives aimed to ensure patients’ participation in randomized clinical trial and to help professionals to care for patients when the professionals were not absolutely needed. Professionals were relatively higher positioned in the clinic than relatives were, which allowed professionals to in – and exclude relatives. Neoliberal ideology and medical-professional rationality go hand in hand when it comes to patient treatment, care and the involvement of relatives; it is all about efficiency, treatment optimization and increased social control of the diagnosed patient. These neoliberal, organizational values consolidate doxa of the medical field and the positions that govern the meeting with patients’ relatives – if it takes place at all. Originality/value: The results put into perspective how the combination of neoliberalism and medical logic work as an organizing principle in contemporary healthcare systems, and challenge a normative, humanistic view on involving patients’ relatives in the medical clinic. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bourdieu; Medical rationality; Neoliberalism; Oncology; Psychiatry; Relatives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054784057

Grounded in empirical examples, the paper illustrates how the researcher’s role is shaped through interactions with organizational members and by context. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an ethnographic study in an IT department of a Nordic bank and draws on empirical material generated through a combination of data: shadowing, interviews, observations and documents. Excerpts from fieldnotes are included to invite the reader into “the scenes” played out in the field and are analyzed in order to illustrate the shaping of roles in situ. Findings: The study finds that, independent of the researcher’s role as sponsored by the organization, the interactions with organizational members and context determine whether the researcher is assigned a role as insider or outsider, or even both within the same context. Originality/value: The paper contributes with a new discussion of how the roles of insiders and outsiders are fluid by discussing the shaping of the roles in situ. By drawing on relational identity theories, the paper illustrates how interactions and context influence the researcher’s role, grounded in empirical examples.

Design/methodology/approach: In Study 1, raters coded photographs and photo captions found on 1,048 personal SNWs of US managers or business owners. Approximately 22 percent of managers’ personal SNWs contained references to alcohol, providing a base rate large enough to warrant further research. In Study 2, laboratory experiment participants saw a fictitious company’s website including a professional managerial profile. A 3 × 3 factorial design then varied whether the prospective manager’s comments on his personal SNW emphasized professional activities, social drinking, or alcohol abuse; also, the manager’s friends’ comments emphasized work activities, social drinking, or alcohol abuse. A control group did not see a personal SNW. Findings: Alcohol abuse information on personal SNWs – whether posted by the manager or by the manager’s friends – negatively affected attitudes toward the manager.

The purpose of this paper is to assess consumer’s preferences for food information presentation in four European countries (UK, Greece, Denmark and France) in a workplace dining setting. Design/methodology/approach: This study focusses on workplace canteens since the regularity in which they are used provides an important context and potential for behaviour change. An exploratory phase designed iteratively in collaboration with experts, end-users and researchers (qualitative) informed a survey (quantitative) conducted in four European countries. The survey was used to examine workplace diners’ preferences towards food information presentation. Findings: Differences were found and clustered (n=5) to “heuristic processors” (33 per cent) “brand orientated” (25 per cent) “systematic processors” (17.3 per cent) “independent processors” (16.1 per cent) and “tech-savvy” (8.6 per cent). Dual-process theories were used to analyse the findings and produce new insight into how menu information can be most effectively delivered. Originality/value: When eating-out consumers struggle to make choices or make the wrong choice from a health perspective, partly caused by a lack of nutrient profile information as well as other criteria of concern. Giving catering managers the understanding of preferred communication channels can enable a more competitive operator. Traffic light labelling was the optimal presentation with the opportunity for consumers to discover more detailed information if desired.

This study aims to investigate if service managers should differentiate and focus on distinct characteristics according to the service types. Design/methodology/approach: Two consumer experiments serve to assess the potential moderating effect of service type on consumer preferences for experience- versus outcome-oriented forms of customer participation. Findings: The two empirical studies affirm the proposed moderating effect of service type on the effect of experience- and outcome-oriented customer participation characteristics. Experience-oriented characteristics work better for hedonic than for utilitarian services, and one study confirms a stronger positive effect of outcome-oriented characteristics for utilitarian services. Research implications: Further research should replicate the experimental findings with a field study. Furthermore, continued research could analyze the mediators of the interaction of co-production characteristics with the service type in greater detail. Practical implications: Managers can design the characteristics of the customer participation processes according to the nature of the service (hedonic vs utilitarian) and, thus, maximize customers’ willingness to pay.

There is, however, little empirical research describing how services are co-produced with individual customers, nor the most suitable roles for IS/IT in this co-production. This study unpacks how services are co-produced by developing a substantive Theory of Service Co-Production activities (and mediating contextual factors) in the financial services sector. A two-phase theory-building approach is employed. First, a preliminary model is derived based on Activity Theory and extant research. Second, this preliminary model is refined and elaborated upon through an extensive empirical analysis of the co-production of financial services. The study further reveals four key contradictions driving service co-production. These contradictions highlight the incomplete alignment of motives and goals between service professionals and customers, as well as the trickle-down IS/IT impact of this misalignment.

The intention was to identify generic elements that are common among IDPs. The mapping was based on a literature study of a number of IDP guidelines. Eight IDP guides from the last two decades were selected for mapping. The Danish Description of Services functions as a typical representation of a conventional silo Design Practice (CSDP) and as a ‘scale’ against which to map the selected IDP guides. The results indicate a limited consensus on what constitutes an IDP but a possible consensus core that is shared by them all. One commonality is that technical knowledge must inform design decisions, and not simply be used to validate them, but on the other hand, it should not drive them. Another main trait is the interdisciplinary character of these processes, where several professions must be a part of the process from the beginning. The study also found that all IDP guides have a ‘black box problem’, where the desired inputs and outputs of the process are known but no explanation is given regarding the mechanisms of how the integrated design decisions are to be made or how to facilitate this decision-making in an interdisciplinary design team.

This paper offers an integrated analysis of multiple dimensions of network interconnectedness of the growing IS discipline. In line with the social and intellectual dimensions of the underlying theory of science, we synthesise multiple network views on authors, institutions, journal outlets, citations, and themes into a multi-dimensional knowledge network infrastructure analysis of collaborative networks of IS researchers and their academic output. We further introduce two fragmentation types to better address the dynamics of the IS discourse discussed in previous research. Based on a corpus of all 3587 AIS basket of 8 journal articles over 20 years, we use the analytical framework to study whether the fast growth of the IS discipline resulted in a reduced coherence of the overall academic collaboration and the research themes. The analysis reveals that the sampled IS researcher community developed a large core component with influential bridging people who mitigate fragmentation and centralisation. This IS community structure constitutes a valuable asset to cope with fragmentation tendencies in the intellectual dimension (research topics) resulting from many short-term topic bursts and from centralisation of conceptual terms. © 2018, © Operational Research Society 2018.","citation analysis; community; discourse; Dr. James Pick; dynamics; Fragmentation; information systems research; IS discipline; knowledge network; network analysis; Prof. Frantz Rowe","Dynamics; Electric network analysis; Information systems; Citation analysis; community; discourse; Dr. James Pick; Fragmentation; Is disciplines; Knowledge networks; Prof. Frantz Rowe; Information use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057615884

For each buyer motive possible marketing strategies are suggested and briefly discussed.

However, a minimal amount is known about why and whether customers will adopt such fully immersive shopping environments. We therefore develop and experimentally validate a theoretical model, which explains how immersion affects adoption. The participants experienced the environment by using a head-mounted display (high immersion) or by viewing product models in 3D on a desktop (low immersion). We find that immersion does not affect the users’ intention to reuse the shopping environment, because two paths cancel each other out: Highly immersive shopping environments positively influence a hedonic path through telepresence, but surprisingly, they negatively influence a utilitarian path through product diagnosticity. We can explain this effect via low readability of product information in the VR environment and expect VR’s full potential to develop when the technology is further advanced. Our study contributes to literature on immersive systems and IS adoption research by introducing a research model for the adoption of VR shopping environments. A key practical implication of our study is that system designers need to pay special attention to the current state of technology when designing VR applications. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","consumer engagement; hedonic and utilitarian information systems; immersive retail; IS adoption; laboratory experiments; virtual reality","Helmet mounted displays; Information systems; Sales; Visual communication; consumer engagement; Head mounted displays; Immersive; Immersive virtual reality; IS adoption; Laboratory experiments; Product information; Theoretical modeling; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070308669

The concept of 'theorization' from institutional theory is discussed and applied as the main analytical lens to explore how new ideas are introduced, interpreted, and negotiated in the organizational field. Based on a cross-level ethnographic case study, the study traces the process of theorization and shows how actors are informed by local translations and theorizations as they challenge, negotiate and develop collective understandings in the field. Theorization is therefore conceptualized as a continuous multidirectional process of recursive intertwinement between field-level and organizational developments, which may or may not entail institutional change. The study also contributes to our understanding of changing forms of professionalism by proposing the concept 'explicit professionalism' as a way of capturing the new normative standard for public professional work that has evolved from the process of theorizing evidence-based practice. Explicit professionalism is both a descriptive concept and a normative ideal and, it is suggested, an important dimension of new forms of organizational and organizing professionalism, which can aid our understanding of related developments in different professional fields. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Increasingly, however, corporations are seen to be the source of new forms of expert knowledge and occupational categories. Yet we have little understanding of how expert judgement forms and is legitimated inside a large organization. In this study, we examine the emergence of standards of professional judgement in a government organization. Using archival and interview data between 2000 and 2012 we examine how experts in the Danish Film Institute generated professional standards of decision making against the backdrop of intense bureaucratic control. Our analysis demonstrates that norms of professional judgement emerge in a process that is inextricably linked to the emergence of professional role identities. Our core theoretical contribution is the discovery that the legitimacy work of managerial professions operates in two spheres; by first grounding claims of professional legitimacy in broad societal norms, and second, by grounding claims of professional identity in localized but increasingly abstract expressions of professional expertise. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

While our discussion reveals the theoretical underpinnings of the 3Is, it also shows that a number of research challenges related to business ethics remain unaddressed.

However, wind tower infrastructure is susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as tropical cyclones and thunderstorms. Under the context of global climate changes and intense weather events, it is imperative to assess the impacts of extreme conditions on the susceptibility of the global wind power with important implications on energy security and power system resilience. In this paper, we discuss the necessity and rationality of wind power deployment considering extreme weather perspectives on enhancing the global sustainability, security, economics, and resilience. We assess the vulnerability of wind power to extreme weather events under climate change and present the correlation of wind power proliferation, extreme weather events, and climate change issues. Our results indicate that, if extreme wind speed increases by 20% considering a 50-year return wind speed and load safety factor is changed from 1.35 to 1.7, the initial capital cost of wind unit installation by the end of this century could increase by about 12% because of the higher strength in tropical cyclones. In this period, upward lightning strike will be intensified due to the use of taller wind turbines and higher angular speed of blades. Also, additional storm surges and sea ices will potentially cause higher risks to inland and offshore wind tower structures and foundations because of the continuously rising sea levels. It is confirmed in our discussion that the proliferation of wind power generation would be beneficial despite its vulnerabilities by curbing the use of fossil-based power generation units, mitigating severe carbon emission, and reducing climatic changes and extreme weather events, which could also cause significant structural damages to wind turbines installations globally. The article concludes that it is vital in the scientific community to further analyze the relationship among global wind energy integration, extreme weather events, and climate changes, and for politicians to formulate a comprehensive energy policy strategy, as engineers continue to investigate the means of deploying additional inland and offshore wind farms and consider other types of renewable energy resources with a direct link with weather conditions, for a sustainable, economic, secure, and resilient energy production. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Extreme weather; Sustainability; Wind energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066128414

While we understand some of the transactional and relational attributes at stake for firms to leverage engagement with external stakeholders, we do not yet fully understand all the underlying mechanisms that are conducive to greater SOI outputs. At the same time, stakeholder theory emphasizes the importance of such engagement for firms’ financial performance (FP), even though the related findings are far from conclusive. Therefore, this paper suggests and tests a mediation model to investigate the associations between SE, SOI and FP. Based on data collected from 101 mineral companies in Norway, the results show that both transactional and relational interactions are important for improving SOI outputs, and that SOI fully mediates the association between SE and FP (measured by profitability). This suggests that external engagement activities do not directly link to FP, and that the financial benefit begins to appear once a firm is able to transform the acquired knowledge from external stakeholders into innovative outputs. Such open innovation approach thus requires a sustainability orientation to ultimately materialize into a performance benefit. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Mediator; Open innovation; Profitability; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainability","Association reactions; Profitability; External knowledge; External stakeholders; Financial benefits; Financial performance; Mediator; Open innovation; Performance benefits; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064168108

This can make products more recyclable and environmentally-friendly. In this study, we consider two cases, namely, a monopolistic case in which an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and an independent remanufacturer (IR) are integrated and a competitive case in which OEM and IR are independent. A theoretical model is proposed to explore the impacts of DfE on firms' quantity decisions, as well as the impacts of competition on the DfE decision. Comparisons of the optimal decisions in the two scenarios yield some interesting results. In the monopolistic case, DfE reduces the OEMs' willingness to engage in remanufacturing, but the outcome is completely reversed in the competitive case in which DfE will incentivize IR to enter the market and cannibalize OEM's market share. Second, the optimal DfE effort level can be higher (or lower) in the competitive case than that in the monopolistic case, which relies on the relationship between the scale parameter of the investment cost of DfE and the profitability of remanufacturing. In addition, we find that under some conditions a high level of DfE may hurt the environment through the greatly increased total sales, although DfE can help reduce the environmental impact of unit product. © 2019","Cannibalization problem; Competition; Design for the environment; Remanufacturing","Commerce; Environmental impact; Environmental regulations; Investments; Sales; Cannibalization problem; Design for the environment; Investment costs; Optimal decisions; Original equipment manufacturers; Remanufacturing; Scale parameter; Theoretical modeling; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064162051

This study discusses the impact of the polycentric development on the regional gap of energy efficiency (RGEE), i.e. difference in energy efficiency levels among cities in the same region, in the Chinese provincial context, by employing a novel method using nighttime lighting data from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) to measure the spatial structure of provinces and Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) to evaluate the total-factor energy efficiency. Our results firstly show that the polycentric development has a narrowing effect on the RGEE. Second, they show that the more government intervention can narrow the RGEE of a province, but being more open, having more foreign direct investment (FDI), and using more coal can widen the RGEE of that province. Meanwhile, the level of regional urbanization is shown to have no influence on RGEE. Third, they show that the polycentric development has a negative effect on the energy efficiency of large cities, but a positive effect on that of small and medium size cities, which accordingly narrows the RGEE. The conclusions of this study not only reveal insights for policies that aim to reduce the RGEE, but also provide an empirical basis for future urban development strategies in the Chinese provincial context. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Polycentric development; Regional gap of energy efficiency; Satellite light data; Urbanization model","Economics; Investments; Stochastic systems; Urban growth; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Foreign direct investments; Government intervention; Polycentric development; Spatial structure; Stochastic frontier approaches; Total factor energy efficiencies; Urban development; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063991875

Previous research suggests that intermodal transport might lead to emissions savings when traffic is shifted from high- to low-emission vehicles. This study aims to test this hypothesis by comparing intermodal truck-ferry routes and road-only routes within Scandinavia. The environmental performance of 66 routes in eight transport corridors was assessed in terms of carbon footprint using methods, databases, and software from the Life Cycle Assessment domain. To improve the robustness of the comparison between alternative routes, stochastic error propagation was applied to obtain a distribution of carbon footprint values for each route and pairwise statistical tests were performed between these distributions. Shifting freight traffic on ferries leads to emission reductions which size depends on the route, ferry type, and fuel used. Long distance routes by sea must sensibly cut road distance to allow for net emission reductions. The use of ferries transporting cargo only and of liquefied natural gas-powered ferries is highly preferable to the use of ferries carrying both cargo and passengers and of diesel ferries. The results can support the decision making of different stakeholders within the freight transport sector interested in lowering their carbon footprint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Life cycle assessment; Shipping; Sustainability; Uncertainty analysis","Automobile testing; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Decision making; Emission control; Environmental management; Intermodal transportation; Life cycle; Natural gas transportation; Roads and streets; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Truck transportation; Trucks; Uncertainty analysis; Alternative routes; Emission reduction; Environmental performance; Freight transport; Intermodal transport; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Net emission reductions; Transport corridors; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063605964

In this way, consumers can directly buy or sell used products without intermediaries. In this paper, we propose a two-period model that captures the critical feature that consumers can independently purchase or sell used products through a secondary market platform. We explore how the firm should strategically decide its production and quality respond to the anticipated trade of used products among consumers through the platform. The results show that two factors, i.e., the depreciation rate and service percentage fee, play an essential role in driving optimal decisions for the firm. First, the presence of a secondary market platform reduces the total production quantity, but the service percentage fee has a positive effect on it. Second, when the firm solely decides its production, regardless of the depreciation rate, the presence of a secondary market platform can increase the firm's gross profit in some situations.

On average, the number of piracy websites that make requests to EU-based advertising services does not change significantly.

Despite extensive scholarly investigations and managerial interest though, considerations of customer engagement and emotional connections in business marketing have been scant. Researchers tend to focus on individual-level engagement, which is conceptually inadequate to address the inherently multi-actor nature of business-to-business marketing. Therefore, this article introduces the concept of collective engagement, highlighting both its characteristics and the conditions for its emergence. The resulting theoretical framework, with ten propositions, outlines the multidimensional nature of collective engagement, including its multiplicative aggregation, multidirectional valence, phenomenological and shared properties, emotional and institutional interdependence, and emergence in dynamic and multichannel settings. Collective engagement also offers a mechanism for considering emotions in business marketing, a topic that thus far has been largely ignored by the prevalent rational choice paradigm. Thus, this article contributes a systematic, coherent conceptualization of collective engagement and advances the theoretical domains of customer and actor engagement in particular and business-to-business research in general, while also suggesting a detailed research agenda. © 2019",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062811603

The article argues for an understanding of knowledge sharing as an everyday practice that goes beyond the idea of knowledge sharing as a matter of customisation and codification. The research is designed as an explorative case study based on empirical data collected from semistructured interviews, company documents, and the use of photos. Our analysis follows a two-pronged analytical strategy for the interpretation of the collected data, employing inductive reasoning in the search for recurrent themes. We show that the circumstances of knowledge sharing and learning in the studied case are shaped by the local time and space arrangements of the work, and that practices of knowledge and learning are closely linked to the consultants' everyday consultancy experiences and practices. Overall, we consider knowledge sharing and learning in organisations as informal and dynamic processes combined with concrete work situations. Our article provides insights that encourage organisations to enhance their focus on how to build theories and practices on knowledge sharing and learning in organisations, taking into account the local organisation of work and everyday experiences. Through a pragmatist-inspired approach, the interrelatedness of knowledge, learning, and work or practice is key to understanding processes of knowledge sharing and learning, so that organisations and societies can become more receptive in responding to challenges confronting today's knowledge economy. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062326262

Practitioners use risk management based on a common assumption that risk management adds value to projects. Yet, in the complex and ambiguous environment of a project, value is often subjective. If this is the case, then how do stakeholders perceive project risk management to create value? This paper presents a literature review and an empirical study of project risk management as a means of creating value. The empirical study is based on interviews, analyzed through qualitative analysis, to unravel the subjective value of project risk management. Specifically, we addressed how practitioners perceived the connection between project risk management practices and value creation. We found that stakeholders' perceptions of value played an important role in how value was created through project risk management. What a stakeholder perceives to be important, such as the prospective outcomes of a project, influences the perceived value of a given project risk management practice. The empirical findings indicate the need for a contextualized understanding of the value of project risk management, and thereby provide a more nuanced view of the variety of forms through which project risk management can create value. The findings question the “universal ideal” of PRM value creation portrayed in the academic and practitioner literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association",,"Risk assessment; Risk perception; Empirical findings; Empirical studies; Literature reviews; Perceived value; Project risk management; Qualitative analysis; Value creation; Risk management; management practice; perception; project management; qualitative analysis; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061063759

While sharing is vital for value creation, protecting is critical for value appropriation. Prior research has examined this paradox of openness from the perspective of the seeking firm, focusing on the firm-level challenges of inbound open innovation. In this article, we complement that research by illuminating the tensions between sharing and protecting in individual-level outbound open innovation, where we argue that the paradox of openness is most prevalent, yet much less well understood. Drawing on the experience of individual participants, or solvers, in intermediated crowdsourcing contests, we analyze textual data from 2,149 answers to five open-ended narrative questions embedded in a large-scale solver survey, as well as 43 in-depth interviews of solvers. Our findings indicate that individual solvers face fundamental sharing-protecting tensions that carry considerable economic and psychological costs. We also document how solvers attempt to navigate the paradox of openness by employing three formal and four informal value appropriation practices. They build elaborate configurations of these practices, which they tailor to the idiosyncrasies of each contest. They also dynamically adjust these configurations over time, as the contest and the interaction with the seeker unfold. We end by outlining how these findings contribute to a more multifaceted conceptualization and a richer understanding of the paradox of openness. © 2019 The Authors","Crowdsourcing; Open innovation; Paradox of openness; Value appropriation; Value capture","Navigation; Surveys; In-depth interviews; Individual levels; Knowledge protection; Knowledge-sharing; Open innovation; Paradox of openness; Value appropriation; Value captures; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060873817

Data were collected from in-depth interviews with a wide range of employees and from internal operational documents. These data were codified and analysed as evidence of the types and intensity of links between organisational elements. The results illuminate the complex interplay of links that are imperative if the permanent organisation is to derive value from its projects, and shows that these links are context-dependent and vary between organisations. It is that the links exist, and not what the type of link is, that matters most. That these links extend beyond the project's execution is critical for maximising value.

The initiative functions as a major social experiment, where the same project methodology was implemented in several Danish project-based organizations. We analyze five of these organizations. We identified reasons for the differences and grouped them in a conceptual model: the ‘house of time to impact’ with three areas: valuing speed, owning speed and entraining speed in the organization.

Seeing infrastructure as partial connection brings our attention to the ontological experimentation with knowing organizations through work of establishing and cutting relations. We illustrate this claim through a multi-sited ethnographic study of ‘The Data Warehouse’. ‘The Data Warehouse’ is an important infrastructural component in the current reorganization of Danish educational governance which makes schools’ performance public and comparable. We suggest that ‘The Data Warehouse’ materializes different, but overlapping, infrastructural experiments with governing education at different organizational sites enacting a governmental hierarchy. Each site can be seen as belonging to the same governance infrastructure but also as constituting ‘centres’ in its own right. ‘The Data Warehouse’ participates in the always-unfinished business of organizational world making and is made to (partially) relate to different organizational concerns and practices. This argument has implications for how we analyze the organizational effects of pervasive databased governance infrastructures and invites exploring their multiple organizing effects. © The Author(s) 2018.","Education; ethnography; information technology; infrastructure; ontology; partial connection; Science and Technology Studies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058715099

We suggest that innovation speed of OSS project can signal the unobservable project quality and attract users’ interest in downloading and using the software. We contextualize innovation speed of OSS projects as initial release speed and update speed and examine their impacts on user interest. Drawing on the signaling theory, we propose a signaling effect through which a higher initial release speed or update speed increases user interest, while the effect diminishes as initial release or update speed increases.

The framework is general enough to embed many popular stochastic volatility models. We develop closed-form expansions and sharp error bounds for VIX futures, options, and implied volatilities. In particular, we derive exact asymptotic results for VIX-implied volatilities, and their sensitivities, in the joint limit of short time-to-maturity and small log-moneyness. The expansions obtained are explicit based on elementary functions and they neatly uncover how the VIX skew depends on the specific choice of the volatility and the vol-of-vol processes. Our results are based on perturbation techniques applied to the infinitesimal generator of the underlying process. This methodology has previously been adopted to derive approximations of equity (SPX) options. However, the generalizations needed to cover the case of VIX options are by no means straightforward as the dynamics of the underlying VIX futures are not explicitly known.

This way, the so-called Dynamic Visualization Map is obtained, in which the individuals are represented by geometric objects chosen from a catalogue. A Dynamic Visualization Map faithfully represents the dynamic magnitude by means of the areas of the objects, while it trades off three different goodness of fit criteria, namely the correct match of the dissimilarities between the individuals and the distances between the objects representing them, the spreading of such objects in the visual region, and the preservation of the mental map by ensuring smooth transitions along snapshots.

Therefore, strategic choices are endogenous in performance equations. Despite increasing efforts by various scholars in solving endogeneity bias, prior attempts have almost exclusively focused on single, one-sided, and discrete (binary) organizational decisions. Yet, in reality, managers often face multiple, simultaneous, and interdependent decisions, possibly including a continuous choice set. These choices may further entail a two-sided process between managers and others, such as employees, strategic partners, customers, or investors, whose choices and preferences also affect the final decision. We discuss how endogeneity can plague the measurement of the performance effects of these two-sided strategic decisions—which are more complex, but more realistic, than prior representations of organizational decision making. We provide an empirical demonstration of possible methods to deal with three different sources of bias, by analyzing the performance effects of two human capital choices made by founders at startup: the size and average quality of the initial workforce. © The Author(s) 2018.","endogeneity; human capital choices; selection effects; simultaneous equations; strategy-performance effects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041920812

Therefore, more needs to be known about how actors shape and are shaped through and within firms’ networks. Design/methodology/approach: To clarify the process of reshaping business in networks, the focus of this study is on the role of actors in firms’ networks during the main stages of development. The major events for each stage are described in terms of how these events affect the interaction, alignment and interfaces between individual actors and business actors with a focus on individual and collective interests. Findings: The individual actor plays a key role in the start-up stage, whereas the business actor has a key role in the final stage when the firm has become an important player in the industry. In later stages, the individual actor plays a gradually decreasing role and the business actor an increasing role. However, it appears that an analysis of the interplay between the two levels of analysis provides deeper insight into the shaping.

Still, it is not obvious where to initiate production of the biorefinery crop without damaging existing ecological systems or maybe even to strengthen local environments. This paper uses a targeted approach to identify the most suitable agricultural areas to convert from cereal to grassland production while gaining multiple environmental benefits. For the Danish region, three individual biomass goals were set: 1) reach 3 × 10 6 t dry matter from organically produced non-fertilized grass-clover mixtures, and 2) reach 5 × 10 6 t dry matter from grass fertilized with 300 kg N/ha, or 3) 450 kg N/ha. Areas for conversion were selected based on coastal nitrogen (N) loads and a surrounding nature index in a stepwise manor until the three biomass goals were reached separately. Our results reveal a spatial distribution of some of the areas selected for conversion close to existing nature areas and vulnerable aquatic environments for all goals. Producing 5 × 10 6 t dry matter fertilizing grass with 450 kg N/ha requires less agricultural area (23% of total agricultural area) compared to fertilizing with 300 kg N/ha (28%) and even less than producing only 3 × 10 6 t dry matter without fertilizing (24% of total agricultural land). Despite less land area, goal 3 still has a higher coastal N load compared to goal 2, and consequently goal 2 reaches 50–60% of the national N reduction goal to reduce 13,000 t N compared to 21–28% for goal 3. Furthermore, surrounding nature shows a higher index value for goal 2 compared to goal 3. Hence, in our case goal 3 would be preferable if land scarcity was the heaviest weighing factor. Still, the environmental gain resulting from using goal 1 and 2 would increase potential multifunctionality of converting from cereal to grass production. © 2019","Biorefinery; Cereal; Grassland; Multifunctionality; Nature; Nitrogen load","Bioconversion; Refining; Supply chains; Biorefineries; Cereal; Grassland; Multifunctionality; Nature; Nitrogen loads; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063590682

PSS have the potential to facilitate sustainable production and consumption and support a transition towards a circular economy (CE). The environmental sustainability is often highlighted as a driver for and a result of PSS. However, the social dimension and the shared value created by PSS have not yet achieved the same attention. In this paper, a framework for sustainable value propositions in PSS is developed with the aim to map and understand the potential sustainable value proposition based on the three core elements of PSS: product, service and system and by investigating the economic, environmental and social value proposition and the type of interaction required for each dimension. The framework thus provides insight into the enlargement of value, when focus shifts from product to service to system. The proposed framework is exemplified by a case study of school furniture and learning environments in Denmark, where the experiences highlight that an understanding of value proposition in a system perspective provides a broader recognition of value for multiple stakeholders. In a product perspective for school furniture, the sustainable value proposition entails price and investment; comfort and design; and narrowing resource loops. In a service perspective, the sustainable value proposition entails a focus on reducing total cost of ownership; service employment; and slowing resource loops. Lastly, a system perspective entails a sustainable value proposition of solutions to societal problems through innovative design and economic savings via rental agreements; better work environment and improved learning outcome; and closing resource loops. The type of interaction changes from transactional to partnerships when moving from a product to a system focus. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Learning environment; Product-service system (PSS); Sustainable value proposition; Value creation","Computer aided instruction; Economics; Environmental impact; Product design; Circular economy; Learning environments; Productservice system (PSS); Sustainable values; Value creation; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063354358

Yet, many proposed IS instances never get implemented. In this article, the authors argue that lack of clear understanding on how trust develops in the context of IS may prevent the implementation of new IS initiatives. Initiating new IS typically require upfront investments, such as pipelines and waste treatment equipment, and take place in a cross-industry setting. This upfront and cross-industry setting of new IS may restrict firms in their ability to develop trust prior to the IS investments. Management literature provides a large body of literature on trust. Based on a multidisciplinary conceptual study, the aim of this paper is to synthesize and combine empirical and theoretical research from the fields of IS and management, and theorize how trust applies to the field of IS, i.e. how firms can deploy certain strategies to develop trust prior to the IS investment in the context of upfront and cross-industry IS investments. As a result, this paper introduces a conceptual IS trust framework and proposes an agenda for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual framework; Industrial symbiosis; Investment; Partnership; Research agenda; Trust","Investments; Pollution control; Waste treatment; Conceptual frameworks; Industrial symbiosis; Partnership; Research agenda; Trust; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063320748

Line hardening in PDN, upgrading the energy storage size in microgrids and water tanks in WDN are considered as three clean candidate strategies. In analyzing each scenario of the main problem, the microgrids which are connected to the PDN are modeled as emergency sources through the first stochastic sub-problem that can restore disconnected loads and water pumps. Water pumps as critical loads are equipped with emergency generators with limited fuel capacity. If there are some water pumps which cannot be restored in each scenario of the main problem, their emergency generators will be scheduled with the second sub-problem of the model.

Its environmental toll is routinely linked to deforestation and biodiversity loss. However, soybean trade also imposes a huge demand on water and land resources, in individual countries and globally. Such a burden, and its underlying sectoral drivers, is frequently overlooked within the current research and policy agenda around sustainable soybean supply chains. This study evaluates the Virtual Water Trade (VWT) and Virtual Land Trade (VLT) of global soybean trade and reveals which countries and sectors are responsible. Soybean-related VWT and VLT are estimated by combining physical import and export data and associated resource use information from 166 countries during the period 2000–2016. Over this period global virtual soybean-related virtual water and land trade grew by 298% and 250% respectively. In 2016, 812 Gm 3 of water use and 41 Mha of land use was directly embodied in international soybean trade. This corresponds to one-third of water and land used to grow soybean globally. Soybean-related VWT and VLT was mainly driven by demand in China, the Netherlands and Brazil, for soybean grown in the US, Brazil and Argentina. Animal feed is responsible for around three-quarters of this resource use. A reduction in the consumption of animal products or switching to direct human consumption of soybeans would reduce the overall demand for soybean production and associated resource use. Although welcome, calls for deforestation-free soybean supply chains do not go far enough to reduce the large, global water and land demand of soybean trade. The research and policy agenda around soybean trade warrants a broader focus on water and land use and whether this represents an efficient, and logical, allocation of resources within the context of food provision and national resource security. © 2019","Animal feed; International soybean trade; Sectoral responsibility; Virtual land trade; Virtual water trade","Animals; Biodiversity; Deforestation; International trade; Land use; Natural resources management; Supply chains; Animal feed; Animal products; Biodiversity loss; Human consumption; Import and exports; Sectoral responsibility; Soybean production; Virtual water trade; Water resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062951272

Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the effects of economic, cultural and institutional distances and target firms in technology- and knowledge-intensive industries on the completion of cross-border M&As by Chinese firms. It also examines the interplay between distance factors and technology- and knowledge-intensive industries on cross-border M&A completion. This study adopts a quantitative approach and is based on a sample of 768 announced cross-border M&A deals by firms in China between 2000 and 2015. Findings: The results indicate that economic distance increases the likelihood of the completion of cross-border M&As when the target is in a more developed economy than China, but decreases when the target is in a less developed economy. Cultural and institutional distances have a significant, negative impact on the completion of cross-border M&As. In addition, target technology-intensive industries have a significant direct negative effect on cross-border M&A completion and moderate the relationship between the distance factors and the likelihood of cross-border M&A completion. Research limitations/implications: The results reveal factors that affect the completion of cross-border M&As by emerging market firms (EMFs). Further research, however, is needed to discover how distance factors affect how EMFs find, evaluate and negotiate international bids. To broaden the scope of the research, data for firms from other EEs would also be required.

Thinking has been a neglected variable in word-of-mouth research, despite the fact that several conceptual arguments indicate that thinking is likely to enhance talking. Here, the thinking–talking association is examined in the context of service encounters. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected with a critical incident method, and the main variables were measured with questionnaire items. Findings: Thinking about a service encounter – after it has been completed – had a positive influence on subsequent talk to others about the encounter. The association was mediated by the memorability of the service encounter and the extent to which what had happened had been subject to rehearsal with the purpose of telling others about it. In addition, with respect to antecedents of consumer thinking, the results indicate that service encounter incongruity had a special role in why the consumer thinks about encounters after they have been completed. Originality/value: The findings should be seen in relation to the dominant position of customer satisfaction as an antecedent to word-of-mouth in the existing literature. The present results, however, indicate that satisfaction’s contribution to the variation in talking about the encounter was modest. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Autobiographical memory; Customer satisfaction; Service encounters; Talking; Thinking; Word-of-mouth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063578427

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether culture dimensions predict country differences in the relationship between gender and organizational commitment. The study integrated theories of social learning, role adjustment and exchange that link commitment to organizational roles to explain such differences in gender effects. Findings indicate that an alternative modernities perspective on theories of gender and commitment is better warranted than is a traditional modernities perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined the relationship between gender and organizational commitment using primary data collected in 26 counties. The cross-level moderating effects of individualism, masculinity, uncertainty avoidance, power distance and restraint vs indulgence was examined using hierarchical linear modeling. Findings: Organizational commitment is found to be higher among men than women in four countries (Australia, China, Hungary, Jamaica) and higher among women than men in two countries (Bulgaria and Romania). Results shows that large power distance, uncertainty avoidance, femininity (social goal emphasis) and restraint (vs indulgence) predict an association between being female and commitment. These all suggest limitations to the traditional modernity-based understanding of gender and the workplace. Originality/value: This study is unique based on the three theories it integrates and because it tests the proposed hypothesis using a multi-level nested research design. Moreover, the results suggest a tension between an alternative modernities perspective on top-down governmental effects on commitment through exchange and bottom-up personal effects on commitment through social learning with role adjustment in an intermediate position. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Commitment; Country cultures; Gender; Hofstede; Modernity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063319026

The analysis focuses on solidarity as reciprocity and, in particular, how it is affected by such factors as actor motivations, internal participatory functioning, resource mix and political legitimacy. While further empirical work is needed, the findings suggest that solidarity as reciprocity produced by social and solidarity economy organisations thrives where political institutions are both supportive and trusted, where public funding is accessible, and where partnerships with relatively autonomous social and solidarity economy organisations are genuinely collaborative. © 2019, The Author(s).","Civil society; Europe; Public policy; Social economy; Solidarity","civil society; comparative study; policy making; social organization; social participation; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060141232

When organic consumption reaches a certain level, further increases in organic consumption are more likely to take place at the same time as dietary habits are improved.

It promises to enhance poor families' ability to minimize financial shocks, undertake human capital investments in health and education and/or engage in modest asset accumulation in order to take advantage of promising investment opportunities in their economies. However, the financial sectors in most sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have been found to be unwilling or unable to serve the poorest segments of the populations. This renders access to finance still a key challenge in stimulating growth and poverty reduction in SSA. Therefore, this chapter discusses the different ways in which financial inclusion can help achieve the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals of ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all by 2030. The discussions also provide pointers to some of the challenges that need to be addressed. One key message is that financial inclusion alone may not provide the poorest segments of African populations with the skills and competences they need to find pathways out of poverty. For this reason, inclusive finance must endeavour to strengthen individuals' control over their lived situations and reinforce their beliefs in their personal efficacy to pull them out of poverty. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study is to determine levels of commitment to corporate sustainability in marketing, processes associated with sustainability marketing commitment, drivers of sustainability marketing at the functional level of marketing, and its organizational context. Using survey data from 269 managers in marketing, covering a broad range of industries in Sweden and Denmark, we took a structural modelling approach to examine construct relationships, mediation, and moderation effects. Overall, the findings show that marketing capabilities associated with the innovation of new products, services, and business models constitute a strong driver to leverage sustainability marketing commitment. In conjunction with insights into processes related to the enactment of sustainability marketing, this result indicates that companies’ marketing departments have a propensity to drive corporate sustainability. The study provides substance to the idea of aligning substantive marketing capabilities closer to dynamic capabilities.

It considers these ideational legacies in depth in relation to NATO enlargement, democracy promotion, and arms control and sets the subject in its wider context where other factors, such as increasingly assertive Russian foreign policy, impact on the relationship. It concludes by demonstrating how tension and mistrust have continued to grow during the Trump administration and considers the future for US-Russian relations. © 2019 David Parker.

The design is based on a simple insight: asking about PSM can render salient PSM-oriented identities of respondents. By randomizing the order of PSM and outcome questions, PSM may be exogenously activated among survey respondents, and the causal effects of this activation assessed. Drawing on this design and a sample of over 5,000 Chilean central government employees—the largest experimental PSM survey sample to date—we find that PSM activation enhances willingness to report ethical problems to management.This provides the first experimental evidence that PSM may promote ethical behavioral intent, and suggests that activating public employees’ PSM can benefit public sector ethics. © The Author(s) 2018.

A crucial question for public administration is how bureaucracies can be organized in ways that minimize illegitimate discrimination. Especially, since theories suggest that prejudices happen unintentionally and particularly under high workload, bureaucrats' working conditions may be important. Four randomized experiments support the notion that bureaucrats discriminate as a way of coping with high workload. Most notably, a field experiment randomly assigned teachers to reduced workloads by giving them resources to have more time with the same group of students. In a subsequent survey experiment-using a fictitious future scenario unrelated to the resources provided in the field experiment-discrimination was minimized in the field treatment group, but persisted in the control group. The results thereby support the notion that even though discrimination among bureaucrats does not (only) occur in a reflective manner it can be reduced by altering the way bureaucrats' work is organized. © The Author(s) 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070265190

Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review and a theory-driven approach are used. A set of propositions are developed, suggesting how the use of BCT in supply chains can be understood to simultaneously enable and constrain SCM and performance. Findings: The analysis identifies four enabling and three constraining blockchain identities to explain how the technology either “facilitates” or “impedes” SCM and supply chain performance. Traceability, which emanates from its ability to provide data immutability, ranks highly as a core innovation of the technology. The blockchain is mainly seen as an opportunity to exploit existing supply chain resources and competencies. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of the research is its conceptual nature. Future research should test the developed propositions empirically. Further research should focus on BCT as an opportunity to explore and as a relationship-building technology. More research is also needed focussing on the complex and simultaneous enabling and constraining effects of BCT in supply chains.

In this article, we introduce a comparative distributional method (CDM), which allows for inferential statistics and statistical modeling of distributions. It also allows for specification of parameter values that precisely characterize the empirical distribution. All this is important for systematic comparisons of empirical distributions. We illustrate the usefulness of the CDM approach by analyzing budget data from seven countries and conclude with a discussion of how this new method can be extended to other areas of public administration than public budgeting. © The Author(s) 2018.

This paper contributes by studying companies’ actions based on their value perceptions, a field which has attracted less attention. Scholars advocate more studies on how companies’ value perceptions shape actions in relationships and how this leads to outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal critical case study of a customer/supplier relationship constitutes the empirical basis of the paper. Interviews and observation studies were conducted over a period of three years, giving access to special insight into the actors’ value perceptions and related actions. Findings: Value perceptions shape actions performed individually, jointly or in the wider network. Moreover, misperceptions of the counterparty’s value perceptions may result in a maelstrom of interactions with no specific value outcome. Acting based on value perceptions is a complex matter due to its evolving nature, which leads to development becoming a value driver. Research limitations/implications: The interdependencies between different value perceptions and their relational value drivers have special effects on actions and outcomes, also, value in actions needs to be studied. Practical implications: Management needs to explore value from different perspectives to understand the counterparty’s value perceptions and communicate own perceptions. It is not sufficient to create value based on one value driver. Instead, it is vital to be able to connect value drivers to balance and prioritise relevant actions. Originality/value: This paper stands out as one of the first contributions to relationship value literature that addresses and analyses value from both a customer perspective and a supplier perspective in a dyadic business relationship. © 2019, Kristin B.

State-of-the-art neuroscience tools and methods were used, including stationary eye tracking and brain scanning electroencephalography (EEG) to assess emotional and cognitive responses to destination images and assets. To the researchers’ knowledge, this study is the first applied neuroscience study in tourism research and thus opens a new path of research and enquiry to this area. This paper is an attempt to understand specific mental processes in human tourism behaviours, and it is suggest that unconscious emotional and cognitive responses are natural processes that need to be studied and understood, not as special cases, but embedded as natural parts of tourism research. Design/methodology/approach: To better understand consumers’ unconscious responses to possible travel destinations, a 3 × 5 factorial design was run with the factors being stimulus type (images, printed names and videos) and travel destination (Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, New York and London). Eye-tracking calibration was done with a nine-point fixation test and the EEG calibration was done using functional localizer tests based on the ABM B-ALERT calibration process. This calibration procedure allows reliable tracking of emotional and cognitive responses over time. Thirty Emirati (nationals of the UAE) participants, consisting of equal numbers of males and females (15) were recruited from the UAE and signed informed consent. Each participant was positioned in front of an eye tracker and computer screen, and brain-scanning equipment was mounted; then, each participant underwent eye-tracking and neuroimaging calibration procedures. A Tobii T60XL eye tracker and an ABM X-10 EEG brain scanner, both running iMotions v5.1 in a Windows 7 environment, were used. Findings: General emotional and cognitive differences were identified between the channels through which travel destinations are presented. Words about and names of travel destinations cause higher cognitive loads, which may not be surprising, given the greater associative load that words have than images. Of particular interest is the hypothesis that images evoke stronger affective responses than verbal representations. However, as previously noted (Holmes and Mathews, 2005), empirical evidence for this assumption seems surprisingly sparse. The present study and the context provided here suggest that decisions on travel destination have an unconscious component and a direct component that may drive or affect overt preference and actual choice. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this paper is that first, neuromarketing is not dependent on sample sizes; however, future studies could build on this paper to understand why there is a preference for cities. It is suggested that unconscious emotional and cognitive responses are natural processes that need to be studied and understood, not as special cases, but embedded as natural parts of tourism research. Originality/value: Thus, tourism research may indeed be a suitable field for understanding the brain bases of complex preference formation and choice. Various researchers have found that a destination image is typically measured using cognitive, affective and behavioural components, and further stated that the cognitive image component of a destination was found to have a significant positive effect on the affective image component and overall destination image (Stylidis et al., 2017). Therefore, this research which has introduced brain scanning can be used to better understand the underlying unconscious emotional and cognitive processes that affect consumer thought and action. An understanding of what goes on in the human unconscious mind is very important for destination marketers, this can help in the integrated marketing communication process to create a destination image and brand. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cognitive; Destination image; Emotional; Motivation; Neuromarketing; Neuroscience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060096495

Design/methodology/approach: A content analysis of publicly accessible documents from the UN System archives was conducted. The analysis was framed through the broader lens of legitimacy theory, drawing attention to the rationalities of decisions taken. Findings: This study illustrated how the need for accounting reforms was rationalised throughout the UN System of organisations. Decision-making processes were reflective of political concerns and the accompanying need to continually demonstrate accountability. The discursive strategies observed associated the need to improve accountability with the adoption of globally recognised accounting systems. However, such logic assumed that existing accountability deficits were intrinsically linked to accounting failures, which overemphasises accounting’s role. Social implications: The UN System’s decision to adopt IPSAS in 2006 has been followed by a substantial increase in the number of Member States following suit. However, governments and other organisations considering IPSAS adoption should be aware of the historical context in which the UN System’s decision was made. Originality/value: This study addresses a lacuna in empirical studies providing an understanding of the role of accounting reforms within international organisations such as the UN System. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","IPSAS; Legitimation; Public sector accounting; Reforms; United Nations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065480315

However, designers struggle at times to apply the different BIM-tools. In order to understand this disjoint, it is necessary to understand first the existing practices of different specialists in the building design process in order to improve future development and implementation of BIM. The aim of this article is to investigate the consequences of using BIM-tools in a collaborative building design setting consisting of different specialists. A case study was carried out to trace when BIM-tools were used (or not) in an inter-organizational design process of a naval rescue station in Denmark. The design process was holistically examined through the lens of Activity Theory which is an analytical framework. Five key findings were identified: the mediating role of 3D visuals, real-world coupling with point cloud, rule-breaking to ensure design completion, inability to integrate BIM-analysis into the design and the use of heuristics to form and choose among design solutions. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","activity theory; building design; Building information modelling; case study","Activity coefficients; Construction industry; Information theory; Activity Theory; Building design; Building design process; Building industry; Building Information Modelling; Collaborative buildings; Holistic analysis; Inter-organizational; Architectural design; architectural design; building; modeling; organizational framework; theoretical study; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059001492

Design/methodology/approach: Combining PCSR, SDGs and business and human rights (BHR) literature, the paper develops an extension of the risk-based due diligence process described by the BHR literature, helping companies identify societal needs to which they may contribute in accordance with PCSR through engaging in the SDGs. Findings: Companies can benefit from resources they already invest in due diligence to identify their adverse human rights impacts, by drawing on the insights gained on broader needs, including human rights, to which they may contribute. This can help them develop appropriate interventions to address local needs and advance their moral legitimacy through assisting in SDG-relevant fulfilment of human rights. Research limitations/implications: The paper provides theory-based guidance on how companies can assess their capacity for contributing societal value through human rights-oriented SDG interventions. Future empirical research may explore how companies apply the extended due diligence process to assess needs and determine relevant actions. Practical implications: The paper offers a principle-based analytical approach for integrating the “do no harm” imperative of BHR theory with PCSR’s call for business assistance in the delivery of public goods and the SDGs’ call for business action to “do good’. Social implications: This paper enables enhanced business implementation of the SDGs in line with PCSR and human rights theory, especially the emergent field of business and human rights.

The findings suggest that transformational leadership and one component of transactional leadership, namely verbal rewards, are positively associated with innovative behaviour.

In this study, we investigate spare parts supply chains serving heterogeneous demands from multiple service locations under the mode of make-to-order. We aim to compare different configurations (i.e. centralised and distributed) of spare parts supply chains in terms of their performance (e.g. sojourn time and cost) and to further propose suggestions to better configure AM-based spare parts supply chains by effectively allocating AM machines at service locations (SLs) or regional distribution centres (RDCs). In order to realise these research objectives, the simulation approach is used as the main research method. Different from the existing perception, our results illustrate that the distributed deployment of AM machines does not always guarantee a quick response, and that centralised configuration is desirable when the demand rate is relatively high due to the pooling effect. The distributed configuration, however, can still be suitable, considering the development of AM technology. Our results also indicate the possibility of a mixed configuration of AM-based supply chains with the potential for outperforming the purely centralised/distributed configuration. The criteria to design such a mixed configuration are also offered. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","additive manufacturing; heterogeneous demand; make-to-order; spare parts supply chain","3D printers; Location based services; Distributed configuration; Distributed deployment; Heterogeneous demand; Make to order; Regional distribution; Simulation approach; Spare parts supply; Technological development; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057341882

These not easily reconcilable roles act as major constraints upon the form and content of exhibitions and work against the adoption of an agonistic approach. However, the paper also argues that war museums are especially apt to become sites of political contestation able to engage with agonistic memory and unsettling counter-narratives. This is due in large part to the nature of the subject matter they deal with, as war and conflict lend themselves to being represented in ways that emphasise patriotic consensus but can also highlight dissent, contestation, multiple perspectives and alternative visions of society. Agonistic practices emerge when windows of opportunity open through a combination of top-down and bottom-up agency able to take advantage of particular socio-political circumstances or cultural developments. The paper also discusses a new exhibition on war memory planned for late 2018 in Essen, Germany and conceived as a strategic political intervention, which aims to communicate in an agonistic fashion with its audiences. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agonism; diplomacy; multiperspectivity; politics; War museums",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054570318

Further, we find that though CAPM is able to explain the value premium in big stocks, it fails to explain the growth premium in small stocks.

Traditional manual control testing procedures become inefficient or require highly specialized and scarce technical knowledge. This study presents audit procedures that follow a new approach. Instead of manually testing internal controls, automated procedures search for the absence of those controls. Process mining techniques are combined with advanced statistical analysis where process mining serves as a data analysis technique to create process models from the recorded transaction data. These are searched for critical data constellations in combination with an exploratory factor analysis to identify systematic deficiencies in the internal control system. The manual and time-intensive inspection of individual controls is replaced by automated audit procedures that cover the totality of recorded transactions.

This cycle may serve as a roadmap for purchasing and supply management (PSM) practitioners seeking to improve access to supplier resources. In addition, this article informs PSM scholars about the status of the supplier resource mobilisation literature and proposes avenues for future research. The cycle includes six stages: (1) becoming an attractive customer, (2) segmenting suppliers, (3) generating supplier satisfaction, (4) becoming a preferred customer, (5) engaging in supplier-oriented actions, and (6) integrating supplier resources. Finally, we introduce the articles in this issue that each examine a different stage of the supplier resource mobilisation process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Customer attractiveness; Strategic supply management; Supplier resource mobilisation",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067823204

This handicaps the principal when the principal seeks to adjust the product mix. Our main conceptual finding is that there is “mix stickiness.” The agent’s superior information about the relative costs of different products or activities leads to an advantage for the status quo; that is, there is inertia (or stickiness) in the mix of products or activities pursued. The historical mix has an advantage because the asymmetric information about relative costs has less of an impact when the mix does not change. If the mix changes, the producer can extract information rents by claiming high costs on the least reduced or most expanded products. Only in the case of larger shifts in the environment will the mix change. Changing the mix comes with the advantage of making rationing cheaper. Our analysis gives new insight into several business practices. It suggests, for example, that for moderate downsizing, a reinforcement approach of proportionally cutting all activities (lawn mowing) is optimal. When more dramatic downsizing is called for, a reorientation approach of eliminating certain activities (divesting) is optimal. It also suggests that outsourcing may come at the cost of reduced adaptability, and it may help explain why most, if not all, healthcare systems struggle to control cost. © 2019 INFORMS","Asymmetric information; Downsizing; Healthcare cost; Outsourcing; Production mix; Production scope; Rationing","Health care; Lawn mowers; Outsourcing; Asymmetric information; Downsizing; Health care costs; Production mix; Rationing; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066944802

In this paper we develop an emerging branch of inquiry challenging a sole focus on linguistic narrative in favour of accessing the experience of entrepreneurs by asking them to draw an image of their venture using pencils and paper. Drawing has long been recognised in other social science disciplines as an empirical method for eliciting in-depth and latent information about complex or difficult experiences. In this paper we show some indicative drawings created by entrepreneurs, accompanied by their verbal explanations of what these drawings represent for them, and we highlight how the process was a generative exercise for the entrepreneurs. We focus on two aspects of drawing, which we refer to as “beginnings”, and “traces”, that we feel are particularly relevant to why this medium is valuable for exploring the experience of entrepreneurs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Drawing; Drawing methodology; Entrepreneurial experience; Images; Narratives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066275006

This article examines the involvement of citizens in an ideation platform initiated by a local government and investigates the motivations affecting participation intensity. Drawing on self-determination theory, we analyze what motivates citizens to participate in an open government platform and how these motivations influence participation quantity. Based on a survey among platform users and the analysis of usage data from the platform operator, we find that motivations of citizen participation in public administration greatly vary across forms of participation. Whereas, intrinsic motivation is positively associated with producing and consuming platform content, external and introjected regulation negatively relate to individuals’ active contribution.

Surprisingly, market participants mobilize old-fashioned economic theory, such as Irving Fisher’s quantity theory of money in their discussions of how to deal with the new problems of collateral liquidity. Today, ‘collateral is the new cash’, as one sector report claims, marking a shift from a quantity theory of money to one of collateral. Liquidity, I argue, poses not only practical problems to market participants and regulators, but also epistemic ones. Accordingly, practitioners not only produce practical but also theoretical responses to it, mobilizing classical economic theory in so doing. The problem of liquidity is shown to relate closely to a problem of ‘sovereignty’ in the narrow sense of guaranteeing the safe value of collateral. Contrary to established conceptions, sovereignty in this sense is not limited to states, but can also occur with monopolistic agents in the market such as global custodians. Thus, following the recent decade of crisis, general epistemic problems of liquidity and sovereignty in contemporary finance become visible through the practical problems and solutions in relation to collateral – specifically in the practical problems of buttressing liquidity in its double nature of collateral velocity and quality or safety. © The Author(s) 2019.","collateral; economic theory; European Union; Financial markets; liquidity; Target 2 Securities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064901252

According to this fact, renewable energies become popular in recent years. Employing nanofluids can help scientists to improve the performance of such systems. The impact of iron oxide–water nanofluid, as working fluid, was employed to evaluate entropy generation in an enclosure in existence of magnetic force. To analyze the performance of heating unit, both view of first and second law of thermodynamic should be involved. In current research, environment-friendly magnetic fluid namely Fe 3 O 4 -water ferrofluid has been studied which is useful in magnetic nanostructured materials have been found to be very efficient in wastewater decontamination. More exactly, the behavior of magnetic nanofluid through a porous space with innovative computational method is displayed. To involving porous media, non-Darcy approach was considered. Outcomes are obtained via Control volume based finite element method (CVFEM) to portray the impacts of Hartmann, Rayleigh numbers and permeability. Results display that dispersing nanoparticles leads to augment in thermal performance and decrease in entropy generation. As permeability enhances, Bejan number improves. As Lorentz forces augments, impact of adding nanoparticles reduces and exergy loss detracts. Dispersing nanoparticles are more beneficial in lower values of permeability. © 2019","Entropy; Exergy and CVFEM; Heat transfer; Magnetic field; Nanofluid; Porous","Entropy; Exergy; Heat transfer; Iron oxides; Lorentz force; Magnetic fields; Magnetite; Nanoparticles; Porous materials; Control volume based finite element methods; Environment friendly; Magnetic nanofluid; Nanofluids; Porous; Second Law of Thermodynamics; Thermal Performance; Wastewater decontamination; Nanofluidics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063096260

This paper provides a novel contribution to the field by examining the factors related to willingness of potential Chinese consumers to further adopt EVs. Much of the research to date has focused primarily on consumer perceptions in European countries, or within particular cities or urban provinces of China. Given that China also is the largest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, and that transportation is growing in its contribution to China's national carbon footprint, the potential for larger scale uptake of EVs by Chinese consumers is an important area of research. We therefore utilize a survey instrument among a fairly large national sample (805 respondents across all Chinese provinces) to solicit perceptions of Chinese consumers about their willingness to adopt EVs, and the importance of different types of motivations, controlling for socio-demographic variables. Using descriptive statistics as well as multivariate analysis and principal component analysis, we find that willingness to adopt EVs is associated with performance features of electric vehicles, the perceived benefits of driving an electric vehicle and policy support for the promotion of electric vehicles. We conclude by elaborating on the implications of our findings, namely insights for car dealerships and sales personnel, automotive manufacturers, local and national planners, and users and adopters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonizing transport; Electric mobility; Electric vehicles; Pro-environmental behavior; Purchasing intentions","Automobile manufacture; Carbon footprint; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Multivariant analysis; Sales; Surveys; Automotive manufacturers; Decarbonizing transport; Descriptive statistics; Electric mobility; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Multi variate analysis; Pro-environmental behaviors; Socio-demographic variables; Electric bikes; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; perception; surveying; urban transport; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062937851

Using a game-theoretic model, this research addresses the complex interplay of different contingencies that shape the coordination and control challenges facing MNEs when they implement global CSR strategies, including brand spillovers, the risk of public scandals caused by irresponsible behavior, the size of the MNE network, as well as the roles played by nongovernmental organizations and altruistic managers. Challenging the view of CSR as insurance against lapses of responsible conduct, our model shows that investment in social brands helps avoid irresponsible practices across the MNE network, thereby inducing subsidiaries to “walk the talk.”. Managerial Summary: Global social brands are increasingly valuable to multinational enterprises (MNEs), which makes the control and coordination of responsible behavior across their network of foreign subsidiaries a relevant managerial challenge. Indeed, lapses of responsible conduct at the subsidiary level often generate reputational damage at the multinational level. This research explores several mechanisms that help MNEs manage this coordination and control challenge. First, it shows under what conditions MNEs can leverage their investments in social brands to induce responsible practices across their global network. Second, it illustrates how MNEs can exploit collaborations with nongovernmental organizations to reduce the costs of coordinating and controlling their subsidiaries. Finally, it identifies conditions under which MNEs benefit from hiring altruistic managers to run their subsidiaries. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","coordination and control; CSR; irresponsible behavior; MNEs; social brand","Game theory; Managers; Coordination and Control; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); irresponsible behavior; MNEs; Multinational enterprise; Nongovernmental organizations; Operational strategies; social brand; Coordination reactions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062351848

Since 2003, the number of applications for design rights (protecting design innovations) has tripled compared to a doubling in the numbers of both patent and trademark applications. However, despite the growing interest of firms in design innovations, knowledge of the determinants of design innovations is limited. Prior work on labour mobility within the innovation studies literature has focused primarily on the discussion of scientists as being crucial for the creation of technological innovations. The present paper expands on this discussion by drawing parallels with the relation between scientists and technological innovation and the relation between designers and design innovation. We explore whether a similar positive relationship exists between the labour mobility of designers and the generation of design innovations and which determinants influence this relation. We employ a unique Danish dataset containing information on firms, their hiring of designers, and their design innovation activity measured by design rights. Our findings show that hiring a designer does increase the likelihood of producing a design innovation. Hence, designers are a determinant of design innovations. However, in order for the firm to benefit fully from hiring a designer, prior experience in design innovation is required. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061437149

The objective of this paper is to shed light on the making of value-adding crowdwork arrangements. Specifically, the paper explores crowdwork platform governance mechanisms and the relationships between these mechanisms and organizational value creation. Building on a comprehensive review of the extant literature on governance and crowdwork, we construct an overarching conceptual model that integrates control system and coordination system as two complementary mechanisms that drive crowdwork platform governance effectiveness and the consequent job provider benefits. Furthermore, the model accentuates the role of the degree of centralization and the degree of routinization as critical moderators in crowdwork platform governance. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of crowdwork to contribute not only to inclusion, fair wages and flexible work arrangements for workers but also to organizations’ value and competitive edge. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Centralized platforms; Crowdwork; Decentralized platforms; Digital economy; Gig economy; Governance; Literature review; Organizational value; Work organization","Information systems; Centralized platforms; Crowdwork; Decentralized platforms; Digital economy; Gig economy; Governance; Literature reviews; Organizational value; Work organization; Management information systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060892070

Our systematic review of 96 articles analyses the patterns and contributions of NBS literature, revealing four thematic junctures: (1) comparative business systems, (2) firm internationalisation and the management/organisation inside MNCs, (3) the role of internationalisation in the development of organisational capabilities and innovation and (4) the emergence of transnational communities in and across firms and societies. Themes are described in terms of (a) the research questions (RQ) they focus on, (b) how NBS approach investigates the RQ and what are the major findings, (c) how IB frames and approaches the same RQ, (d) how does the NBS approach extend the perspectives of IB and (e) what are the problems faced by NBS in terms of developing further insights into the RQ. Our review contributes to the recent endeavour of IB research to institutionalism, encouraging a productive dialogue between IB and NBS research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Comparative management/organisational studies; Institutionalism; International business studies; MNC strategies; National business systems; Organisational capabilities and innovation; Transnational communities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058217454

Using survey data from 155 auto parts manufacturers in Pakistan, we find that local firms’ realized absorptive capacity enables them to develop both exploitative and exploratory innovations. The findings further suggest that local suppliers’ learning intent mediates the relationship between potential and realized absorptive capacity which in turn lead to both types of innovation. In the context of the emerging economy of Pakistan, local suppliers’ absorptive capacity is found to be critically important in spurring exploitative and exploratory innovation, but learning intent enables realized absorptive capacity and thus in conjunction with realized absorptive capacity supports innovation. Consequently, there would be a strong case for policy intervention to assist emerging economy firms in building their absorptive capacity and strengthening their learning intent as a route for promoting innovation and improving their value added position in the global value chains of multinational enterprises. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive parts industry; Exploitative innovation; Exploratory innovation; Knowledge transfer; Learning intent; Organizational learning; Potential absorptive capacity; Quantitative methods; Realized absorptive capacity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057864876

As a means to encourage contributions early in the life cycle of a crowdfunding campaign, entrepreneurs often choose to offer discounted rewards in limited numbers. Though previous research suggests that scarcity of rewards can increase the chances of success, it remains unclear whether these early bird offers continue to have an effect on the decision making of backers even when sold out, as they remain visible on the campaign’s webpage. Drawing on the theory of the phantom effect, this paper explores (1) how sold-out rewards influence backers’ selection of available options and (2) how the phantom effect may interact with different discount amounts. We conducted an online experiment with 229 subjects simulating the pledging process for a crowdfunding campaign that attempts to raise funds for the publication of a book. Our findings suggest that potential backers choose the undiscounted version of a reward more often, if a discounted, sold-out reward (phantom option) is displayed. This effect is significant when the phantom option has a high discount, but not significant when the phantom option has a low discount. Consequently, in contrast to the traditional perspective that sold-out options negatively impact sales, we suggest that, in reward-based crowdfunding, sold-out rewards may increase the chances of success, if considered and applied strategically. This study therefore offers counterintuitive implications for research as well as for entrepreneurs seeking funds through reward-based crowdfunding. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Early bird offers; Out-of-stock; Phantom effect; Reward-based crowdfunding; Scarcity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056137246

The peculiarities of Big Data applications span different fields such as customer need identification, risk management and decision-making, data-driven knowledge, product and service design, quality management, and opportunity recognition and creation. However, while these have resulted in the emergence of a rich research domain focusing on the managerial and practical implications typically addressed from the user perspective, there is still a lack of complete understanding of how companies that provide Big Data solutions can create and capture value from them. This paper explores the question of how provider companies create and capture value from Big Data, drawing on a multiple-case study analysis of provider companies that offer solutions and services based on Big Data. The results illustrate a theoretical framework on value creation and capture by relying on Big Data and identify two main innovation service strategies based on Big Data used by provider companies. In addition, this paper provides valuable insights as to how the network of involved stakeholders influences the design and implementation of the innovation service strategy by the provider companies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Big Data; Business model; Digital innovation; Digital technologies; Open innovation; Service innovation; Value capture; Value creation","Decision making; Product design; Quality management; Risk management; Business modeling; Digital innovations; Digital technologies; Open innovation; Service innovation; Value captures; Value creation; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050074609

If search has an explicit future focus, this paper refers to it as forward-looking search. Previous research has focussed on the firm or innovation portfolio level. Little research has investigated whether forward-looking search practices occur during innovation projects and whether they may contribute towards a project's innovativeness. This paper follows the bounded rationality assumption, which views decision makers as lacking complete knowledge and anticipation of the consequences of their decision. The current study posits that project teams must engage in forward-looking search during project development to ensure their project's innovativeness. However, this paper argues that this is only relevant if there is 1) room in project planning to facilitate forward-looking search, 2) slack resources available to implement such changes, and 3) a dynamic external environment. The data on 159 unique innovation projects from the Danish manufacturing industry show that forward-looking search significantly impacts innovativeness. Furthermore, this study finds that project planning and slack resources moderate this relationship, while industry concentration has no moderating influence. These findings suggest that to increase the innovativeness of projects, continuous forward-looking planning should retain room for flexibility and slack budgets for project adjustment during execution. © 2018 The Authors","Forward-looking search; Industry concentration; Innovation projects; Innovativeness; Project planning; Slack resources","Budget control; Forward looking; Innovation projects; Innovativeness; Project planning; Slack resources; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049657294

Since it is a complex procedure that requires an adequate system, the recent trend consists in outsourcing RL to third-party reverse logistics providers (3PRLPs). This paper provides the background of sustainable triple bottom line theory with focus on economic, environmental, and social aspects under 3PRL concerns. The relevant sustainability criteria are used in a case study conducted in cooperation with an Indian automotive remanufacturing company. To select the most preferred service provider, we use a hybrid method combining a variant of ELECTRE I accounting for the effect of reinforced preference, the revised Simos procedure, and Stochastic Multi-criteria Acceptability Analysis. The incorporated approach exploits all parameters of an outranking model compatible with the incomplete preference information of the Decision Maker. In particular, it derives the newly defined kernel acceptability and membership indices that can be interpreted as a support given to the selection of either a particular subset of alternatives or a single option. The proposed ELECTRE-based method enriches the spectrum of multiple criteria decision analysis approaches that can be used to effectively approach the problem of the 3PRLP selection. As indicated by the extensive review presented in the paper, this application field was so far dominated by Analytic Hierarchy Process and TOPSIS, whose weaknesses can be overcome by applying the outranking methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Multiple criteria decision analysis; Outranking method; Reinforced preference; Robustness analysis; Sustainability; Third-party logistics provider","article; human; sensitivity analysis; social aspect; stochastic model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048312468

Where existing research has examined the role of purchasing in facilitating early supplier involvement in new product development, little research has been done to date on how purchasing's role might change when facing technologically uncertain NPD that require new capabilities and new technology. Based on an in-depth case study of a technologically uncertain NPD project in the passenger ship rescue equipment industry, the paper sheds light on how supplier involvement in NPD projects with a high degree of technological uncertainty impacts on a company's sourcing strategies and the challenges this poses for purchasing. Based on the case study findings, we propose a) that early purchasing involvement in technologically uncertain NPD projects requires a mature purchasing organization that possesses competences to interact effectively with R&D and b) that involving a new supplier from a different industry in NPD projects characterized by technological uncertainty requires a leap of faith from both innovating firm and supplier.

In this article, we investigate the relationship between diversity attitudes and the performance of gender diverse teams, and further, we show how numerical team gender composition is a key link in this relationship. Based on survey responses from 1,085 academic team leaders, we show that openness to diversity is strongly associated with team performance. We also find a moderating effect of the degree of gender diversity, so that the effect of openness to diversity, as positive team level diversity attitudes, is stronger when team gender composition converges towards numerical balance. These findings bridge critical mass theory and diversity and performance scholarship by establishing the joint effect of compositional and contextual characteristics on the performance of gender diverse teams. © 2017 European Academy of Management","critical mass theory; diversity; gender; gender distribution; openness to diversity; team performance; teams",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038018898

The purpose of this paper is to improve the understanding of construction output – being the numerator in construction productivity calculations – by focussing on changes in quantity of the products, product characteristics and composition of the aggregate rather than as changes in price. Design/methodology/approach: The research design of this study applies statistical data from the national accounts along with data from four paradigmatic case studies of social housing projects covering a period of 50 years. Findings: The results indicate that while construction output prices have increased threefold over the past 50 years, improvements in performance can only explain approximately 20 per cent. Research limitations/implications: The developed four-step method has demonstrated its value as a means to measure changes in the characteristics of the product, but more studies on the actual figures and results over time and regions are required before solid conclusions can be drawn. Social implications: This study has added new knowledge of construction output that supports the development of a more accurate construction statistics, which in turn can assist the design of more effective and evidence-based policies for improving construction productivity. Originality/value: This paper describes and demonstrates a novel performance-based methodology for addressing changes in the characteristics of the products in a longitudinally perspective, which can potentially provide a better understanding of changes in productivity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Innovation; Management; Organization; Process; Productivity; Value management","Management; Processing; Societies and institutions; Statistics; Construction outputs; Construction productivity; Construction statistics; Design/methodology/approach; Measuring performance; Product characteristics; Social implication; Value management; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066871979

Yet, traditional urban transport planning has neglected this important role and has limited its focus to the efficiency of the transport network itself, thereby overlooking the more difficult to measure socioeconomic implications. This chapter reports on the use of accessibility metrics in evaluating social and spatial equity in Ahmedabad, India. In particular, we quantify the effect of two public transport systems [bus rapid transit system and metro rapid transit system] and an urban development project-social housing relocation-on the equitable distribution of job opportunities for low-income residents in the city. We model these interventions using a geographic information system-based network modeling technique and demonstrate that such a technique can be used for measuring levels of accessibility, and by extension for measuring transport equity. Our findings show that, whereas the BRT in itself provides a small improvement in job accessibility for the urban poor, the housing relocation project combines improperly planned locations of new housing with insufficiently effective public transport upgrades. The relocation creates a spatial mismatch between residential and job locations, which further reduces social and spatial equity. The presented metrics can highlight critical investment and policy reform needs for the developing cities in India and beyond. Policymakers are encouraged to use the developed approach in the planning stages of infrastructure and land-use development projects to achieve more favorable effects on social and spatial equity for the urban poor. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data are derived from a sample of (small-scale) suppliers of local and regional food to a large British supermarket. Partial least squares regression analysis was used to test a conceptual framework, which positions relational justice as a mediator in the relationship between key customer categorization and supplier performance, moderated by the length of the relationship. Findings: The findings reveal that small suppliers who perceive their treatment by their key customers as fair tend to achieve higher business performance, which supports the hypothesized mediating role of relational justice on supplier performance. However, this research found no evidence to support the hypothesis that this role is moderated by the length of the relationship between the supplier and buyer. Originality/value: This paper makes a novel empirical contribution, focusing on performance outcomes for small-scale suppliers in a highly competitive environment (fast-moving consumer goods) with customers (supermarkets) who have significant market power.

This article aims to fill this gap and explains the classroom cream-skimming behavior of school teachers in Denmark, defined as prioritizing the teaching of academically promising students. Drawing on the street-level bureaucracy literature, it tests the following propositions: (1) creaming is directly related to an inadequacy of resources, and this relationship is moderated by the breadth of parental involvement in their children’s education; (2) creaming is weakly related to the presence of bureaucratic success criteria; and (3) creaming is directly related to the level of parental involvement in and satisfaction with their children’s education. These are tested using data from a 2011 survey of Danish and mathematics teachers in public and private schools across Denmark, and a class-fixed-effects design.

Design/methodology/approach: This research draws on case studies of two biotechnology firms operating in pharmaceuticals and medicine, which represent different contexts regarding the uncertainty and complexity of innovation development. Findings: The study suggests two distinct roles of meetings in the context of innovation development: meetings as regulating and ordering; and meetings as a resource. In the first role, meetings serve as a regulative mechanism that brings together multiple elements of control into a system. Meetings as a meta-practice regulate and order by bracketing elements of innovation in time and space, rendering the innovation process more manageable and allowing actors to handle the complexity of knowledge. In the second role, meetings are used as a resource, sporadically intervening in the ongoing activities of innovation projects. The study explains how these two roles relate to the uncertainty and complexity of innovation development and have different implications for management control. Originality/value: The study challenges the instrumental view of meetings by taking a closer look at their structuring potential in the organization.

Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a qualitative study approach is used to develop findings abductively. The data are gathered through an in-depth case study at two firms: semi-structured interviews, meeting observations, shadowing and pricing documents. Findings: This paper finds that pricing is a collective decision-making process involving multiple actors across the organization. The case firms work on solving information, coordination and control problems to arrive at sales prices by enacting interlinked practices.

Findings: The findings reveal that adaptive business style and communication mediate the overall effect of open-mindedness on trust building between partners in the export markets. The adaptive business style fully explains the effect of open-mindedness on communication. Open-minded persons are better prepared to achieve communication on a high level because they are more likely to adapt to a new business style. Performing adaptive business style improves communication, particularly when the importer belongs to a dissimilar culture.

This book considers the underlying political conditions that enabled cycling to appeal to such a wide range of citizens in Copenhagen and asks how this can be replicated elsewhere. Despite Copenhagen's global reputation, its success has been a result of a long political struggle and is far from completely secure. Car use in Denmark is increasing, including in Copenhagen's suburbs, and new developments in Copenhagen include more parking for cars. There is a political tension in Copenhagen over the spaces for cycling, the car, and public transit. In considering examples of backlashes and conflicts over street space in Copenhagen, this book argues that the kinds of debates happening in Copenhagen are very similar to the debates regularly occurring in cities throughout the world. This makes Copenhagen more, not less, comparable to many cities around the world, including cities in the United States. This book will appeal to upper-level undergraduates and graduates in urban geography, city planning, transportation, environmental studies, as well as transportation advocates, urban policy-makers, and anyone concerned about climate change and looking to identify paths forward in their own cities and localities. © 2019 Jason Henderson and Natalie Marie Gulsrud.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077899966

Due to the widely ranging energy contents of major organic carbons and their diverse degradation pathways, as well as their highly varying hydrolysis capacities, predicting methane yield is not as simple as predicting the production of other biofuels. This study investigated the hydrolysis behaviour of organic compounds using the operational conditions of real-scale biogas plants (hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 15, 20, 30, and 45 days) and explored a new approach to determine the biochemical methane potential (BMP), which can be used to predict the methane yield of a wide range of agro-industrial wastes. The degradation of hemicelluloses and cellulose increased gradually, closely following first-order degradation kinetics, at longer retention times. In spite of their longer retention times, only 45% of hemicelluloses and 34% of cellulose decomposed. The newly proposed BMP model was validated using 65 internal and external datasets. The model error (RMSE P ) was in the range of 37.4–87.7 NL CH 4 kg VS −1 while the relative model error (rRMSE P ) was in the range of 12.1%–47.8%. The model fits best to gently lignified biomass, but the overestimated results obtained with woody biomass and winter harvested grass indicate that further investigation of the hydrolysis of well-lignified biomass is required to enhance the precision of the model. © 2019","Anaerobic digestion; BMP model; CSTR; Lignin; Lignocellulose; Methane","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Cellulose; Degradation; Forecasting; Hydrolysis; Industrial plants; Industrial wastes; Lignin; Methane; Agro-industrial wastes; Biochemical methane potential; Bmp models; CSTR; First order degradation; Hydraulic retention time; Lignocellulose; Operational conditions; Biomass; Biogas; Cellulose; Degradation; Forecasts; Hydrolysis; Industrial Wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062704007

In theory, this approach holds great promise in terms of engaging stakeholders in dynamic processes of creating the corporate brands, but a brand co-creation process also exposes the organization to, for example, loss of control, dilution of identity and potential disharmony between the multiple voices co-creating the brand. Paradoxically, while brand co-creation has received increased theoretical attention, the role of the internal stakeholders (especially the employees) in this process remains vastly uncharted. Therefore, through an empirical case study of the Danish National Gallery, this paper shows how a public organization, which has engaged in brand co-creation, struggles to orchestrate the many internal voices in the co-creational dialogue. The importance of considering internal stakeholders in the co-creation process is illustrated through the discovery of six diverse brand expressions that surface in the so-called touchpoints of co-creation, i.e. the museum’s communication with external stakeholders. Here, different professional groups of employees communicate their version of the brand, leaving the impression of a brand speaking with several, at times clashing, voices. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Brand co-creation; Branding in public organizations; Communication; Corporate branding; Employees; Internal stakeholders",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050638745

In the context of public life, value is an important measure on the contribution to business and social good of activities for which strict financial measures are either inappropriate or fundamentally unsound. A systematic, interdisciplinary examination of public value is necessary to establish an essential definition and up-to-date picture of the field. In reflecting on the 'public value project', this book points to how the field has broadened well beyond its original focus on public sector management; has deepened in terms of the development of the analytical concepts and frameworks that linked the concepts together; and has been applied increasingly in concrete circumstances by academics, consultants, and practitioners. This book covers three main topics; deepening and enriching the theory of creating public value, broadening the theory and practice of creating public value to voluntary and commercial organisations and collaborative networks, and the challenge and opportunity that the concept of public value poses to social science and universities. Collectively, it offers new ways of looking at public and social assets against a backdrop of increasing financial pressure; new insights into changing social attitudes and perceptions of value; and new models for increasingly complicated collaborative forms of service delivery, involving public, private, and not-for-profit players. © 2019 Adam Lindgreen, Nicole Koenig-Lewis, Martin Kitchener, John D.

Disadvantages of fossil fuels make renewable and cleaner energy sources more widely used. Wind energy is a type of clean energies that will help humanity transition to a sustainable future. The power of wind turbine depends on many parameters such as wind profile and blade geometry. In most studies, wind speed is generally considered to be constant and uniform along the rotor blades. But in fact the nature of wind has irregularities in space and time. Moreover, wind shear leads to non-uniformity in wind vertical profile. Having a good understanding of these kinds of spatial and transient irregularities and also their influence on wind turbine performance reduce uncertainty in design process. In the present study the blade has been designed by blade element momentum (BEM) theory and aerodynamic coefficients have been calculated along the blade length. The effects of wind shear have been studied on the designed blade. Power law has been used to model wind shear. By merging this function with BEM theory, its effect can be calculated along the blade length. Results show that wind shear has little impact on aerodynamic coefficients near the root region. Most of changes occur at 0.2 to 0.8 of the blade length. Furthermore, existence of shear in wind profile regarding the turbine designed for uniform inflow, reduces the kinetic energy flux, ability to extract the available potential and power generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerodynamics; BEM; Horizontal axis wind turbine; Power coefficient; Wind energy; Wind shear effect","Aerodynamics; Boundary element method; Fossil fuels; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Shear flow; Turbomachine blades; Wind; Wind power; Wind turbines; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerodynamic coefficients; Blade element momentum theory; Blade-element momentums; Horizontal axis wind turbines; Power coefficients; Uncertainty in design; Wind shears; Turbine components",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062157867

This creates a potential problem where large amounts of animal manure will not be utilized for biogas production, and, correspondingly, will not contribute to the production of either renewable energy or valuable digestate (fertilizer). Moreover, the pressure on an imported (external) and highly exploited resource - here, sand - is increasingly calling for more sustainable and self-sustained farm systems, as far as cow bedding materials are concerned. The methodological approach in this paper is first to investigate state-of-the-art sand-separation technologies in Denmark and the USA, particularly in relation to their environmental and energy performance, then, second, to analyze how other types of bedding materials can be utilized by drawing on on-site (internal) farm resources, namely residual straw and the fiber fraction of manure. The results of the analysis suggest that, in particular, manure fibers are beneficial for animal welfare and biogas production, resulting in a more circular economic system. The paper concludes by presenting a new farm-biogas system that sustains such circularity. To support this development, we further suggest investigating in new ventilation technology to limit the amount of ammonia that is produced in dairy stables as a result of using manure fibers as bedding material. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Circular economy; Dairy cow; Manure fibers; Sand bedding; Sand-separation technology","Ammonia; Animals; Biogas; Economics; Environmental technology; Farm buildings; Fibers; Manures; Sand; Circular economy; Dairy cow; Energy performance; Manure fiber; Methodological approach; Potential problems; Renewable energies; Separation technologies; Fertilizers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062145125

Therefore, we need to diversify water resources and reshape stormwater management. Our study evaluated the potential for increasing economic value while reducing the environmental impacts of implementing new concepts for non-potable rainwater use in a new urban development. We analysed five alternatives: a conventional groundwater-based drinking water system (A0-GW), three types of centralised ways of treating runoff collected from impervious areas (CT1-CT3) and a decentralised system for rainwater harvesting (DT-RWH). All five alternatives included stormwater collection with a system of basins and trenches for flood protection. Potential environmental impacts were quantified by life cycle assessment (LCA), while the economic system value was assessed in terms of total value added (TVA). The LCA and TVA were evaluated over the entire water chain, including effects at the end-user level and an estimation of the single economic added value for each stakeholder. A combined LCA and TVA provided an assessment of eco-efficiency. The four runoff-based alternatives exhibited up to 95% reduced freshwater depletion impacts compared to the conventional drinking water system. In all alternatives, more than 94% of the ecotoxicity impacts were due to the discharge of metals (zinc and copper) from runoff into freshwater, and the three centralised treatment alternatives (CT1-CT3) reduced ecotoxicity by 80%. Overall, the two centralised ultrafiltration plants (CT1-CT2) showed the lowest effects in all impact categories, except for reserve base resource depletion, which was affected by stainless steel production.

Today, research in surgical education applies terms and methods from other performance domains such as sport and music. However, there still seems to be a lack of consensus as to how talent may be brought into the discourse about surgical education. Especially, when it comes to identifying and developing trainees who in the future will perform better than the average surgeon. Design/methodology/approach: This five-step scoping study aims to map existing literature about talent identification, talent development and development of expertise in the domains of surgery, sport and music in the period of 1985-2014. Findings: A total of 242 studies, divided in the four domains of surgery (69 studies), sport (115 studies), music (34 studies) and cross-disciplinary studies (24 studies) published in the period 1985-2014 were included. Originality/value: Informed by the performance domains of sports and music and their inclusion of a holistic, ecological approach to research, this study suggests that research in surgical education may benefit from broadening its view on talent by including psychosocial variables and environmental, demographic and structural influencers when considering how surgical talent may be identified and developed. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Music; Performance domains; Sport; Surgical education; Talent identification; Talent management",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065486098

Leadership is an imperative antecedent to occupational safety. Transformational leadership is considered a central aspect of safety-promoting leadership and passive/avoidant leadership is considered a central aspect of poor safety leadership. This study aimed to comprehensively elucidate concrete, real-life transformational and passive/avoidant leadership behaviours through context-specific descriptions of day-to-day interactions between construction site managers and employees. A mixed method design was applied, combining structured observations of construction site managers, with questionnaire responses from construction employees. With this design, common method bias was eliminated. The results provide context-specific examples of transformational and passive/avoidant leadership behaviour. High proportions of observed transformational leadership was found to predict high construction site safety. High proportions of observed passive/avoidant leadership was found to predict low construction site safety. The proportion of transformational leadership behaviour was higher among site managers in Sweden than in Denmark, indicating that national cultural context may be an antecedent to safety leadership among construction site managers. Applying less passive/avoidant leadership and more transformational leadership appears to be an effective way for construction site managers to improve occupational safety in the industry. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Inspired by fieldwork in three Danish coastal communities, the article attends to discussions on fishing, tourism, and change, in which residents referred to ‘museum’ or ‘museum town’ as shorthand for an undesirable transformation. The article answers: (1) what are the underlying concerns of becoming a ‘museum town?’ and (2) how is authenticity employed by community members in connection to desirable and undesirable outcomes of transition? The analysis probes the ‘museum town’ expression as a means to understand host communities’ relationship to the fishing and tourism sectors and their expressed interest toward authenticity. Empirical material from semistructured interviews and ethnographic field observations initiates the thematic analysis, which then continues with a theoretical reflection on authenticity. Coastal community members understood authenticity through demonstrations of realness, waterfront and community activity, and a desired independence for the fishing industry. Being authentic required a working fleet, which carried deeper implications for transformation and the complementarity of tourism, as opposed to its suitability as a substitute for the fishing industry. Calls for the fishing industry to remain independent highlight the importance for cross-sector dialogue for local development. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Authenticity; coastal communities; fisheries; resident perception; transition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044760358

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between firm acquisition characteristics and post-acquisition knowledge exploration and exploitation in the Chinese domestic acquisition market. Design/methodology/approach: By using patent and company data of 188 domestic Chinese deals completed between 2002 and 2013, the paper replicates the measurements and analytical methods of the US-based study by Phene, Tallman and Almeida (2012) to address the acquirer’s opportunity to explore and/or exploit external knowledge, its ability to absorb and effectively assimilate such knowledge and thus establish innovations in new technologies. Findings: The paper finds support for a positive effect of knowledge uniqueness of the target on the bidder’s post-acquisition exploration. The findings also support that the post-acquisition exploitation is facilitated by the commonality of technological knowledge between the bidder and the target, a result that, although expected, was not be supported in the US-based study. Originality/value: This paper qualifies the generalizability of US-based findings about post-acquisition exploration and exploitation in the context of China. It also responds to the call for China-focused knowledge management research by capturing innovation capability building by Chinese firms through domestic acquisitions. Finally, it contributes to the nascent literature on replication in management studies. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerging market strategies; Exploration/exploitation; Mergers and acquisitions; Replication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063584136

Such instruments to reveal reliable, independent metrics and indicators to evaluate companies’ performances on sustainability exist, however, in research fields that previously have not been used extensively, for instance, life cycle assessments (LCAs). ISO 14001:2015 has implemented life cycle perspective, however, without being explicitly clear on which methodology is preferred. This paper aims to investigate LCA as to improve companies’ transparency towards sustainability investors through a literature review on sustainable investment evaluation. Design/methodology/approach: The literature review is conducted through the search engine Google Scholar, which to date hosts the most comprehensive academic database across other databases such as Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge, Science Direct, etc. Search words such as “Sustainable finance”, “Sustainable Investments”, “Performance metrics”, “Life cycle assessment”, “LCA”, “Environmental Management Systems”, “EMS” and “Environmental Profit and Loss Account” were used. Special journals that publish research on LCA such as International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment, Journal of Cleaner Production and Journal of Industrial Ecology were also investigated in-depth. Findings: The combination of using LCA in, for instance, environmental profit and loss accounts studied in this paper shows a comprehensive and reliable tool for sustainability investors, as well as for social responsibility standards such as ISO 14001, ISO 26000, UN Global Compact, GIIN, IRIS and GRI to incorporate. With a LCA-based hybrid input-output account, both upstream and downstream’s impact on the environment and society can be assessed by companies to attract more funding from sustainability investors such as shareholders, governments and intergovernmental bodies. Research limitations/implications: The literature review is based on publicly disclosed academic papers as well as five displayed company Environmental Profit and Loss accounts from the Kering Group, PUMA, Stella McCartney company, Novo Nordisk and Arla Group. Other company experiences with integration of LCA as a reporting tool have not been found, yet it is not to conclude that these five companies are the only ones to work extensively with LCA. Practical implications: The paper may contribute to the clarification of LCA-thinking and perspective implementation in both ISO 14001 and ISO 26000, as well as in other social responsibility standards such as the UN Global Compact, the Global Impact Investing Networks, IRIS performance metrics, the Global Reporting Initiative and others. Originality/value: The paper is one of the first that evaluates LCA and environmental profit and loss accounts for sustainability investors, as well as for consideration of implementation in social responsibility standards such as the ISO 14001 and ISO 26000, as well as in other social responsibility standards such as the UN Global Compact, the Global Impact Investing Networks, IRIS performance metrics and the Global Reporting Initiative. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental profit and loss accounting; Hybrid input-output consequential methodology; Life cycle assessment; Performance metrics; Social responsibility standards",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058083630

Regardless of company size or industry sector, a majority of project teams and companies use customized processes that combine different development methods - so-called hybrid development methods. Even though such hybrid development methods are highly individualized, a common understanding of how to systematically construct synergetic practices is missing. In this paper, we make a first step towards devising such guidelines. Grounded in 1,467 data points from a large-scale online survey among practitioners, we study the current state of practice in process use to answer the question: What are hybrid development methods made of? Our findings reveal that only eight methods and few practices build the core of modern software development. This small set allows for statistically constructing hybrid development methods. Using an 85% agreement level in the participants' selections, we provide two examples illustrating how hybrid development methods are characterized by the practices they are made of. Our evidence-based analysis approach lays the foundation for devising hybrid development methods. © 2019 IEEE.","Hybrid methods; Software development; Software process; Survey research","Electric grounding; Software engineering; Surveys; Analysis approach; Development method; Hybrid method; Industry sectors; Software development process; Software process; State of practice; Survey research; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072348913

Our preliminary results from an exploratory qualitative field study at a multinational SaaS provider in Denmark show that UATs often address the wrong problem in that positive user acceptance may paradoxically indicate a negative user experience. Hence, SaaS providers should be careful not to rest on what we initially term disengaged user acceptance.

A popular strategy is to use microservices architecture. However, such an architecture is also subject to debt, which hinders the continuous delivery process and thus negatively affects the software released to the customers. Objectives: The aim of this study is to identify issues, solutions and risks related to Architecture Technical Debt in microservices. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study of a real life project with about 1000 services in a large, international company. Through qualitative analysis of documents and interviews, we investigated Architecture Technical Debt in the communication layer of a system with microservices architecture. Results: Our main contributions are a list of Architecture Technical Debt issues specific for the communication layer in a system with microservices architecture, as well as their associated negative impact (interest), a solution to repay the debt and the its cost (principal). Among the found Architecture Technical Debt issues were the existence of business logic in the communication layer and a high amount of point-to-point connections between services. The studied solution consists of the implementation of different canonical models specific to different domains, the removal of business logic from the communication layer, and migration from services to use the communication layer correctly. We also contributed with a list of possible risks that can affect the payment of the debt, as lack of funding and inadequate prioritization. Conclusion: We found issues, solutions and possible risks that are specific for microservices architectures not yet encountered in the current literature. Our results may be useful for practitioners that want to avoid or repay Technical Debt in their microservices architecture. © 2019 IEEE.","Architecture; Case Study; Microservices; Technical Debt","Architecture; Computer circuits; Communication layers; Different domains; Exploratory case studies; International company; Microservices; Point-to-point connections; Qualitative analysis; Technical debts; Computer architecture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071154745

In this paper, we study a platform-based retail system consisting of a retail platform who provides a retail facility and a product seller who sells products through the retail platform. The seller pays rent and also a percentage of his revenue to the platform as commissions for using the facility and services of the platform. In a promotion program, both the retail platform and the seller have strategic options of either offering rebates individually or launching a joint rebate. The parties are free to choose their rebate amounts, if any, and their decisions are, therefore, handled as endogenous decisions in our model. We investigate the optimal rebate strategies and performance of each party in the retail system analytically. Research results show that, given an exogenous retail price and a commission rate, the platform and the seller may choose a unilateral rebate or a joint-rebate program. For any log-concave demand function, we prove that an equilibrium on rebates of the platform and the seller exists and is unique. Furthermore, several managerial insights are presented with regard to the selection of rebate programs. Finally, we address the endogenous pricing problem as an extension of the original problem. © 2019, EURO - The Association of European Operational Research Societies and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Game-theoretical analysis; Joint-rebate; Platform-based retailing system; Pricing; Revenue sharing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065020363

Several initiatives and organizations have attempted to generate global LC maps using remote sensing data and in-situ data. Noteworthy examples include IGBP-DISCover, GlobeCover 2009, FAO, GLC 2000, MODIS, GlobeLand30. While researchers including climate change scientists require fine LC maps in terms of spatial resolution and temporal coverage for continuous monitoring of the planet, these datasets lack of fulfilling this goal. Understanding the trend of LC changes as well as the direction of future changes at global level is of vital importance to a broad spectrum of stakeholders, and essential for addressing the sustainable development goals worldwide. European Space Agency has recently released its climate change initiative's LC dataset called CCI-LC, which aims at achieving this ambition with 300 m spatial resolution and 24-year continuous temporal coverage within 1992–2015. The main objective of this study is to quantify the global land changes within this timeframe and also to predict the future land change by 2050 in order to gain a global picture of our future planet. This is a timely objective since more than ever scientists, environmentalist, and governors require to know how our future will look like and how they can achieve the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) i.e., the Paris Agreement. The achieved results reveal massive land changes of different kinds e.g., deforestation, urbanization, desertification, forestry, water and ice shrinkage across different continents. The employed predictive modelling for year 2030 and 2050 messages dramatic changes among different LC types. Our discussions and conclusive comments can guide policy-makers, environmental planners, ecosystem services providers and climate change researchers to gain finer insights about our planet by 2050.

This trend is related to both the complexity inherent in the multiple factors to be considered when evaluating eco-friendly cities (i.e., green cities) and the way this type of city's sustainability depends on many evaluation criteria, which hampers all decision-making processes. Using a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach, this study sought to develop a multiple-criteria model that facilitates the evaluation of green cities’ sustainability, based on cognitive mapping techniques and the Choquet integral (CI). Taking a constructivist and process-oriented stance, the research included identifying evaluation criteria and their respective interactions using a panel of experts with specialized knowledge in the subject under analysis. The resulting framework and its application were validated both by the panel members and a parliamentary representative of the Portuguese ecology party “Os Verdes” (The Greens), who confirmed that the evaluation system created distinguishes between cities according to how strongly they adhere to “green” principles. The advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are also discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Choquet integral; Cognitive maps; Green cities; MCDA; Social responsibility; Sustainability","Cognitive systems; Decision making; Decision theory; Integral equations; Operations research; Choquet integral; Cognitive maps; Green cities; MCDA; Social responsibilities; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061653668

If remanufacturing is to occupy a central role in the CE it needs to be considered from a series of complementary and synchronous business activities. Thus, the aim of this article is to investigate how such an integrated perspective can drive sustainable value creation within the context of remanufacturing business models. This is explored through three business cases: Philips Healthcare Refurbished Systems, Siemens Wind Power, and Orangebox. This ‘integrated view’ considers remanufacturing activities according to: product design and development; remanufacturing processes; value chain design and management; and marketing and consumer/user relationship. The research question asks, ‘Can an integrated perspective drive sustainable value creation in remanufacturing contexts?’ To answer this, the research maps a set of triple-bottom-line indicators across the chosen cases. The work contributes to the field by mapping a set of business mechanisms (e.g. warranties, service approaches, partnerships) that can be utilised to co-develop necessary activities in unison for a successful remanufacturing approach. In certain cases, remanufacturing has the potential to add to the triple-bottom-line through such an integrated approach. However, each of the firms are investing in remanufacturing predominantly for profitability and market protection measures and therefore environmental and social components of the triple-bottom-line must be proactively considered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business model innovation; Circular business models; Circular economy; Remanufacturing; Sustainable value creation; Triple bottom line","Commerce; Wind power; Business model innovation; Business models; Circular economy; Remanufacturing; Sustainable values; Triple Bottom Line; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061328968

The model has evolved through the example of Copenhagen City & Port Development Corporation (By og Havn, n.d.), a publicly owned privately managed institution that leverages public assets through land value capture and Public-Private Partnerships. In addition, City & Port leases and sells land to private investors at market prices. The yield serves public benefit by funding a city-wide metro system. Through a mandate by national law to always maximize the yield, City & Port is sheltered from political interference. Thus, it is the blend between public and private ownership, management, and financing that distinguishes the PAC model as it evolved from the case study of City & Port. In contrast, much literature on public ownership and management focuses upon the operational inefficiencies, bureaucracy, and lack of accountability of public organizations, while literature on private organizations is concerned with the amassment of profits accrued by private investors, despite originating from profit generating public sector-driven initiatives, including value appreciation arising from re-zoning, infrastructure, and other public investments. © 2019 The Author","Infrastructure finance; Local finance; Public asset corporation; Regeneration; Urban development","finance; infrastructure planning; investment; metro system; ownership; port development; redevelopment; urban development; urban renewal; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060083735

Based on a correlational pilot study and an experimental scenario approach, we first link encouragement and discouragement provided by the individual’s parents and friends to venture goal commitment and test the mediating role of opportunity evaluation. Second, we find that emotional intelligence plays a moderating role in the relationship between situational emotional information and venture goal commitment as mediated through opportunity evaluation.

We argue that framing such practices as benevolent obscures the fact that they are discriminatory acts. Drawing on the concept of benevolent discrimination, we conceptualise it along three dimensions: (1) a well-intended effort to address discrimination within (2) a social relationship that constructs the others as inferior and in need of help, which is granted with (3) the expectation that they will accommodate into the existing hierarchical order. Benevolent discrimination is a subtle and structural form of discrimination that is difficult to see for those performing it, because it frames their action as positive, in solidarity with the (inferior) other who is helped, and within a hierarchical order that is taken for granted. We develop the concept of benevolent discrimination building on an in-depth qualitative case study of a Swedish organisation that is believed to be exemplary in its engagement in diversity management initiatives. The organisation is however swayed by an inequality regime based on the intersection of class and ethnicity. We argue that it is precisely because human resources professionals frame their actions as acts of benevolence that they cannot see how they take part in organisational discrimination. © The Author(s) 2018.","Accommodation; benevolent discrimination; class; diversity management; ethnicity; gratitude; inequality regime; racial order; solidarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058682895

The results demonstrate the importance of adjusting for changes in customer population when undertaking such benchmarking—especially when the food retail sector undergoes substantial structural developments.

At the beginning of the so-called refugee crisis, societal discourses portrayed this volunteer work as extraordinarily meaningful – a state we capture through the metaphor of ‘overflow’. This ‘overflow’ mobilised volunteers and was an important point of reference for framing their work experiences as meaningful. Later, shifting discursive and organisational contexts challenged their framings. Instead of letting go, however, the ‘overflow’ triggered volunteers to reframe their experience in dysfunctional ways in order to sustain their sense of meaningfulness.

Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected via in-person interviews in the City of Perm, which is one of the largest and most industrial cities in Russia. A double-bounded dichotomous-choice contingent valuation model is utilized to estimate willingness to pay (WTP) and to analyze factors that affect consumers’ choice. Findings: The results suggest that most respondents do not consider domestically produced cheese as a risky product in terms of food safety but simply of lower quality than imported cheese. However, the average respondent’s WTP discount for domestic cheese compared to imported cheese is 8 percent, which is relatively small. This corresponds to participants’ opinion that buying domestic cheese is the right thing to do since it supports Russian farmers and producers. The results indicate further that with increasing education and income levels, individuals are less likely to prefer domestically produced cheese for either economic or quality reasons. This effect is stronger for the quality preference. Research limitations/implications: The results indicate that if the Russian government aims at expanding the domestic food market further, more attention needs to be paid to ensuring the quality of domestic food products in order to increase consumer acceptance and WTP. Originality/value: This is the first study providing empirical evidence on Russian consumers’ attitudes and perceptions of domestically vs imported food products after the implementation of the Russian import ban, which can be considered as an external policy shock. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer attitudes; Contingent valuation; Food quality; Russian import ban; Willingness to pay","adult; agricultural worker; article; attention; cheese; city; consumer attitude; contingent valuation; education; female; food quality; food safety; government; human; human experiment; interview; male; market; perception; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055449210

This logic suggests that we are unable to address grand societal challenges and ensure economic competitiveness because our societies, institutions, scientific activities or individual predispositions are not sufficiently geared towards innovation. In this paper, we analyze this “deficit model” of innovation in which a lack of innovation is routinely invoked as the main obstacle to social progress. Drawing parallels to research on the deficit model of public understanding of science (PUS), we develop a theoretical framework that captures the dynamics and normative implications of deficit construction, highlighting five salient dimensions: problem diagnoses, proposed remedies, the role of expertise, implied social orders, and measures of success. We apply this framework to three empirical case studies of recent innovation strategies in Luxembourg, Singapore, and Denmark. Attention to this deficit framing around innovation is important, we argue, because it is an essential part of how innovation transforms societies in the 21st century: not only through new technological possibilities or economic growth, but also by shaping public discourse, narrowing policy options, and legitimizing major institutional interventions. The implied pro-innovation bias tends to marginalize other rationales, values, and social functions that do not explicitly support innovation. It further delegates decisions about sweeping social reconfigurations to innovation experts, which raises questions of accountability and democratic governance. Experiences from the history of PUS suggest that, without a dedicated effort to transform innovation policy into a more democratic, inclusive, and explicitly political field, the present deficit logic and its technocratic overtones risks significant social and political conflict. © 2018","Comparison; Deficit model; Innovation imperative; Innovation policy; National innovation strategies; Public understanding of science","Economics; Comparison; Deficit models; Innovation policies; National innovations; Public understanding of science; Computer circuits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054856623

Modern managers are increasingly pushed from both in- and outside the organization to innovate their processes including products and services. Research typically investigates innovative processes from either a technology perspective or managerial mindset perspective, but rarely both. We argue that technology and mindset should be analyzed in combination, as they are fundamentally co-constitutive albeit with different levels of interaction. We categorize the levels of interaction in a two-by-two model, with the Y-axis representing levels of innovative technology and the X-axis representing levels of innovative mindset. This categorization leads to a theoretical framework, a Technology-Mindset Matrix that consists of four typical technology-mindset interactions. We show how each type leads to unique innovative outcomes, and label the four types; incremental innovation, radical technological innovation, radical mindset innovation, and revolutionary innovation. We illustrate each square with case examples. Furthermore, we discuss core B2B issues managers face when transforming their organizations by moving up from incremental to higher ranked modes of innovation. © 2018 The Authors","B2B marketing; Innovation; Managerial mindset determinism; Technological determinism; Technology-mindset matrix",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049352149

Through an ethnographic study in a mental healthcare organization, it is shown how different performances of silence make new decision-making processes available and influence new work practices that are central to understanding the particular characteristics of psychiatric organizations. Although the performance of silence can have somewhat immaterial and mundane connotations, when one uses an actor-network theory approach to organization studies, the performance of silence becomes helpful in conceptualizing how new and old practices are often imbedded into each other. © The Author(s) 2018.","actor-network theory (ANT); ethnography; health care; organizational development and change; performativity; psychiatry; science and technology studies (STS); silence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044345289

A number of different production possibility sets are defined from a dual point of view in the DEA literature; the convex cone, convex hull, free disposal hull, free replicability hull, and free coordination hull, each having different properties. This article introduces a novel DEA production technology that considers the possibility of aggregating units, so it assesses the performance of each unit compared with both individual and aggregated units. Hence, this technology provides a more competitive environment for DMUs to achieve an efficient frontier. On the other hand, possible collaboration between DMUs can be considered using this technology. The strength and practical relevance of the proposed technology is shown in the efficiency analysis of Danish hospitals in a collaborative environment. This yields a bi-classification of hospitals, namely resistant and nonresistant hospitals. The proposed technology has a general framework, and the associated model is easy to solve using standard DEA software. It follows that the current article could potentially be used in other theoretical and empirical research in the future. © 2016 The Authors.

A central concern is how to foster a culture of “Responsible Research and Innovation” (RRI) among scientists and engineers. This paper focuses on RRI teaching at higher education institutions. On the basis of interviews and reviews of academic and policy documents, it highlights the generic aspects of teaching aimed at invoking a sense of care and societal obligation, and provides a set of exemplary cases of RRI-related teaching. It argues that the Aristotelian concept of phronesis can capture core properties of the objectives of RRI-related teaching activities.

We deploy a unique dataset from a special section of the 2014 CIS survey in Denmark, in which we included questions that enable us to unambiguously identify RE innovators. In a quantitative analysis, we contrast collaboration patterns of RE and non-RE innovators, where we find RE innovators to show a higher tendency to collaborate, and with a more diverse set of partners. We complement this analysis with a qualitative single-case study within the offshore wind industry in order to illuminate longitudinal and contextual effects that were only indicative in the quantitative analysis. We focus particularly on changes in the pattern of collaboration as the firm matures and its links with performance. The case shows that because the needs of RE innovators vary through their development, the purpose and types of collaborations change. Further, both from our quantitative and qualitative studies, we find weak relationship between RE firms’ collaboration breadth and innovative performance. We ascribe this to the long time-lags between product innovation and market penetration in RE. We thereby highlight the heterogeneity of collaboration rationales, patterns, and impact across sectors and over time. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Green innovation; Innovation networks; Innovation survey; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030330145

This study aims at combining Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Analysis (using EXIOBASE 3) with up-to-date impact assessment models to quantify the environmental impacts induced by final consumption in the EU Member States in 2011. The environmental extensions are characterized in 14 environmental impact categories out of the 16 used in the Environmental Footprint life cycle impact assessment method. A contribution analysis of key products and services as well as emissions and resources, which drive the environmental impacts of EU consumption, is conducted. Environmental impacts are mainly induced along the supply-chain of products and services. Several expenditures relative to services represent large shares both in the total final consumption and in the 14 impacts under study, despite a relatively low impact intensity. Food products, in particular meat and dairy products, are identified as key contributors regarding acidification, eutrophication, land use, and water use, and to a lower extent climate change. Finally, several manufactured products, raw materials and basic products respectively importantly contribute to impacts on human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and resource uses. The total volume of final consumption expenditures per EU Member State appears a key explanatory variable to most of the impacts embodied in their consumption, yet to a lower extent regarding water use and fossils resource use. Finally, the current limitations in using EXIOBASE 3 for environmental impact assessment are discussed, with specific attention to EXIOBASE environmental extensions and to the case study on EU consumption. Since the classification of emissions and resources for impact assessment requires a number of assumptions that may influence the results, a sensitivity analysis is performed to exemplify some of the key issues relative to the characterization of impacts based on EXIOBASE environmental extensions. © 2019 The Authors","Consumption; EXIOBASE 3; Impact assessment; Input-output analysis; LCIA","Climate change; Environmental impact assessments; Eutrophication; Food products; Land use; Life cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Consumption; EXIOBASE 3; Impact assessments; Input output analysis; LCIA; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060913820

A major challenge of this technology is, however, its intermittent power output, slowing down its rate of implementation in the global energy matrix. As such, waste incineration is a popular technology in the developed countries as a smart measure for the disposal of municipal waste and generating free energy. In this study, a hybrid configuration of a concentrating solar power plant accompanied with a waste incineration unit is proposed. In the proposed system, the waste incinerator offers a variable heating duty in order to regulate the power output of the concentrating solar power plant. The hybrid plant is designed for a case study in Denmark and is thermodynamically analyzed. The results of the simulations are presented and discussed. It is shown that the hybrid system can pave the bed for increasing the share of solar thermal power and bringing more waste incinerators to the electricity market. A 10 MWe hybrid power plant may prevent up to 8000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emission per month. The overall efficiency of the hybrid system is expected to be 24%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power plant; Greenhouse gas emission; Intermittent power output; Thermodynamic analysis; Waste incineration","Carbon dioxide; Free energy; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Thermoanalysis; Thermoelectric power; Waste disposal; Concentrating solar power plant; Developed countries; Hybrid configurations; Hybrid power plants; Modelling and analysis; Power out put; Solar thermal power; Thermo dynamic analysis; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060053050

Purchasing and supply management (PSM) interacts closely with supply network actors, thus influencing how the firm’s value creation is delivered. While previous sustainable PSM (SPSM) research has shed light on how to manage sustainability on an organizational level, the individual competences PSM professionals require are less understood. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a systematic literature review to determine the current research coverage of specific competences and knowledge required to implement sustainability. The authors complemented this with data from 46 interviews with practitioners. From coding the data with NVivo, a first comprehensive competence overview for SPSM was developed. Findings: The literature review results, complemented with interview data, highlight that functional-oriented, cognition-oriented, social-oriented and meta-oriented competences form part of a comprehensive SPSM competence model. We propose a framework that includes these, and integrates two behavioral moderators on the organizational level, i.e. situational enabling, as well as empowerment and obligation. Research limitations/implications: While the proposed framework provides a basic first systematization of SPSM competences, further research is needed to extend it. There is ample opportunity to shed further light on both individual and organizational-level factors that influence the application of SPSM competences, and therefore SPSM behavior. Practical implications: The results have implications for higher education and professional training programs in companies. The framework provides an overview of competences needed for SPSM. The discussion highlights the need to apply education and training methods for different types of competences that are suitable for conveying implicit knowledge apart from explicit knowledge. Originality/value: Adressing a current research gap in sustainability-related competences in PSM, the overall framework highlights SPSM competences of interest to both scholars and managers alike. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competences; Interviews; Purchasing and supply management; Skills; Sustainability; Systematic literature review",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062980570

This paper presents a magnified view of different constructs of IMN and identifies the qualitative factors which are broadly classified under different constructs like political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental. Design/methodology/approach: Principal component analysis is applied to club identified factors into political, economic, social, technological and legal categories. PESTLE–SWOT approach is used to shortlist the identified factors using the elimination algorithm. Using analytical hierarchy process, weightages and rank of the identified factors are evaluated. Interpretive structural modeling is applied to understand inter-relationship among factors, and to analyze the driving power and dependence of the factors. Findings: The results obtained from the above approaches are compared to identify most significant factors and the list of IMN enablers is presented using Venn Diagram. Government stability, Economic freedom, economic stability, environmental sustainability and raw material availability are coming out to be the driving factors across all techniques. Finally, the paper provides weights of the driving indicators common across all multi-criteria decision-making techniques considered.

As identified by literature review and through expert opinions, not all 29 factors responsible for IMN development are crucial. Many factors are either interdependent or driven by others. The paper provides a useful analysis about the driving factors that need to be taken into account. Originality/value: The study presents a comprehensive analysis of the IMN enablers.

Data collected from 256 organizations confirms that direct effects from ITSM capability are mediated by IS-business alignment and strengthened by IS strategic conservativeness. Our findings provide evidence for a co-occurrence of value co-creation and value facilitation mechanisms in internal IT service relationships and for a greater value of ITSM capability in stable strategic contexts.

The focus is limited to three key emerging trends this development is seeing; Big Data, cloud computing and 3D printing. This study is carried out through a literature review and empirical findings from a series of interviews, and an explorative survey. The literature review identified a substantial difference in compatibility between industry level and the digital transformation Supply Chain 4.0 implies. Empirical findings showed that among the investigated trends, 3D printing was considered to have a major impact on Supply Chain 4.0. Its use though has been limited due to uncertainty among the supply chain stakeholders about its true added value in a cost/benefit perspective. Moreover, multinationals showed a strong preference for Big Data implementations, but only had limited focus on cloud computing applications.

What have been the implications of decisions in these areas for the outcomes of WADA policy, as measured by the number, and the type, of doping offences identified by WADA? It is argued that in many respects WADA’s policies represent a missed opportunity for, far from bringing new thinking or offering a new approach to anti-doping, WADA has for the most part simply reiterated and intensified policies which have a long history of failure and that those policies continue to be largely unsuccessful in controlling drug use in sport. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anti-doping policy; drug testing; homo clausus; World Anti-Doping Agency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062974600

Following a brief historical overview on athletes’ view on doping controls, the article synthesizes existing empirical research on athletes’ attitudes with examples and quotes expressed through various media on both anti-doping and specific topics within WADA’s anti-doping framework. Although pockets of disconcert persist, the analysis shows that athletes generally express contentment with the current system and its ambitious aim to homogenise anti-doping efforts. However, athletes have also raised serious concerns on four specific issues, namely on a), the fair and consistent application of the rules for all athletes in a sport, b) the obligation to submit their whereabouts, c) the due processes when facing accusations of violations and d) the possibility for athletes to genuinely participate in the policy and decision making process. The chapter concludes with recommendations on how WADA could accommodate the athletes’ concerns. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","anti-doping; Athletes perspective; WADA; whereabouts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062555396

Although such systems are rhetorically appealing to reformers, once implemented, however, they struggle to compete against an institutional inertia of continued reliance on older accounting systems such as budgetary and statistical systems. The way forward requires asking how to best realign political incentives to focus on the longer-term benefits from using GAAP-based systems, such as improved clarity over long-term fiscal liabilities and transparency over the financing of hybrid entities that span both the public and private sectors. © 2018, © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Accruals accounting; Australia; Canada; consolidated government accounts; New Public Management; New Zealand; Sweden; United Kingdom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054922243

The findings show that citizens' attitudes towards the public sector can be multifaceted and may not always be negative. First, public organizations may be perceived to be less effective than private organizations, but their distribution of outputs is perceived to be more equitable. Second, as evaluations of public sector performance are conditional on respondents' personal beliefs, negative perceptions appear to be concentrated among a subgroup of citizens. © 2018 The Author(s).

This paper presents a framework designed to support the development of a methodology toward meeting these aims and functions as an architecture for design doing (ADD). The framework promotes action at two levels: 1) it captures best practices that are transferrable to other projects and contexts, and 2) it encourages individuals to identify and apply values, principles and processes relevant to daily practice. It also supports the co-creation of methodology by multiple stakeholders.

The second is the unexplained source of autonomy and externality in the definition of institutions. I propose to solve these problems by introducing an aisthetic perspective on institutional endurance. This perspective should not replace but, rather, supplement existing models and theories. The aisthetic perspective conceptualizes institutions as social processes with aisthetic qualities, such as harmony and rhythm. These aisthetic qualities can be felt and perceived, resulting in a positive or negative experience of the institution that, in turn, promotes its reproduction (or not). © Academy of Management Review",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066104425

Accounting control has been discussed intensively as one of the purposes of the management accounting system. Furthermore, accounting for stewardship has been important to the financial accounting debate. Goal congruency issues are central to this discussion. In particular, conflicting interests have been transparent in the transfer pricing literature. The development of the transfer pricing literature is used to illustrate the development of how the accounting system is a vehicle to align incentives in the organization. In conclusion, it is argued that the accrual accounting system more generally serves the purpose of aligning incentives. © 2018, The Author(s).","Accrual accounting; Corporate choice; Decentralization; Individual rationality; Organizational design; Transfer pricing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065737673

For this reason, MNCs benefit from employee networks of relationships that span across intraorganizational barriers, allowing for the efficient mobilization of knowledge across boundaries. Yet, which organizational members are more likely to be able to develop these boundary spanning networks? We leverage a unique data set from a large multinational corporation to empirically test a comprehensive model that captures the effect of an employee's mandate, expertise, and behavioral orientations on her likelihood to span intraorganizational boundaries that manifest themselves in the form of hierarchies, intra-functional domains, and geographic territories. We find that the employees that are more likely to be boundary spanners are those having mandates with a global impact, high levels of expertise, and a collaborative orientation in their networking behaviors. In addition, we find that these effects are stronger for those employees that have large formal workflow networks. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Boundary spanning; Knowledge mobilization; Multinational corporations; Social networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062802837

Several studies have already analysed the technical and economic implications of the mainly decentralised future energy system, but most are restricted in their insights by limited temporal and spatial resolution. This study employs a cluster analysis to develop a municipality typology in order to analyse the techno-economic suitability of municipalities for autonomous energy systems. A total of 34 socio-technical indicators are employed at the municipal level, with a particular focus on the sectors of Private Households and Transport, and the potentials for decentralised renewable energies. Selected quantitative cluster validation methods are employed alongside qualitative criteria to determine the optimal number of clusters. This results in a total of ten clusters, which show a large variation as well as some overlap with respect to specific indicators. An analysis of the municipalities from three German renewable energy projects “Energy Municipalities” “Bioenergy Villages” and “100% Renewable Energy Regions” shows that in eight of the ten clusters municipalities are aiming for energy autonomy (in varying degrees). It is challenging to differentiate between the clusters regarding readiness for energy autonomy projects, however, especially if the degree of social acceptance and engagement for such projects is to be considered. To answer the more techno-economical part of this question, future work will employ the developed clusters in the context of an energy system optimisation. Insights gained at the municipal level will then be qualitatively transferred to the national context to assess the implications for the whole energy system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cluster analysis; Decentralised energy system; Energy autonomy; Socio-energetic indicators","alternative energy; bioenergy; cluster analysis; decentralization; modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062700957

Individuals embedded in closed networks acquire more knowledge and become more creative when the level of collaboration in their network is high.

The aim of the present work was therefore to investigate the magnitude of including these impact categories within a comprehensive environmental impact assessment of organic and conventional dairy systems differing in basic production conditions. Three basic systems representative of a range of European approaches to dairy production were selected for the analysis, i.e. (i) low-land mixed crop-livestock systems, (ii) lowland grassland-based systems, (iii) and mountainous systems. As in previous publications, this study showed that when assessing climate change, eutrophication and acidification impact organic milk has similar or slightly lower impact than conventional, although land-use is higher under organic management. Including soil carbon changes reduced the global warming potential by 5–18%, mostly in organic systems with a high share of grass in the ration. The impacts of organic milk production on freshwater ecotoxicity, biodiversity and resource depletion were 2, 33 and 20% of the impacts of conventional management, respectively, across the basic systems considered. The study highlights the importance of including biodiversity, ecotoxicity and soil carbon changes in life cycle assessments when comparing organic and conventional agricultural products. Furthermore, the study shows that including more grass in the ration of dairy cows increases soil carbon sequestration and decreases the negative impact on biodiversity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Dairy; Ecotoxicity; LCA; Organic; Soil carbon","Agricultural products; Biodiversity; Carbon; Dairies; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Eutrophication; Global warming; Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; Ecotoxicity; Environmental life cycle assessment; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Organic; Organic managements; Soil carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060345763

A variety of business model innovation approaches have been proposed to suit circular economy or sustainability principles. Although they largely have been addressed independently as two separate knowledge areas, there is an opportunity to seize synergies from the intersection of both streams. This paper provides a review of approaches for business model innovation for circular economy and/or sustainability, based on a systematic review of academic literature and practitioner-based methodologies. The systematic literature review identified 94 publications and 92 approaches (including conceptual models, methods or tools). The different approaches were categorized according to the business model innovation process, following a three stage dynamic capability view. Subsequently they were compared based on five characteristics (nature of data, boundaries of analysis, level of abstraction, time-based view, and representation style), to allow for a better understanding of how to use the approaches in research and practice. Based on the review, key findings outlining trends and a reflection about the interface of the scopes of circular economy-oriented and sustainability-oriented business model innovation are presented. Moreover, a number of gaps are identified and a framework that maps a future research agenda to simultaneously advance both streams is outlined. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business model innovation; Circular economy; Circularity; Sustainability","Competition; Business model innovation; Circular economy; Circularity; Competitive advantage; Dynamic capabilities; Level of abstraction; Sustainability principles; Systematic literature review; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060327669

The proposed dynamic model is based on the score of the predictive observation mass function for a high-dimensional panel of weekly match results. Our main interest is in forecasting whether the match result is a win, a loss or a draw for each team. The dynamic model for delivering such forecasts can be based on three different dependent variables: the pairwise count of the number of goals, the difference between the numbers of goals, or the category of the match result (win, loss, draw). The different dependent variables require different distributional assumptions. Furthermore, different dynamic model specifications can be considered for generating the forecasts. We investigate empirically which dependent variable and which dynamic model specification yield the best forecasting results. We validate the precision of the resulting forecasts and the success of the forecasts in a betting simulation in an extensive forecasting study for match results from six large European football competitions. Finally, we conclude that the dynamic model for pairwise counts delivers the most precise forecasts while the dynamic model for the difference between counts is most successful for betting, but that both outperform benchmark and other competing models. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters","Bivariate Poisson; Ordered probit; Probabilistic loss function; Skellam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060302194

Across the existing models accounting for land use activities in life cycle impact assessment, a balance is yet to be found between complexity and comprehensiveness on one hand, and applicability on the other hand. This work builds on the LANd use indicator value CAlculation (LANCA ® ) model, assessing the impacts of land use activities on five soil properties, and aims at developing an aggregated index to improve its applicability. First a statistical analysis is conducted, leading to the shortlisting of the four most significant soil quality indicators. Then two options for aggregating the selected indicators are presented: the soil quality index (SQI), based on linear aggregation, and the normalisation–based soil quality index (NSQI), where the aggregation process involves normalisation integrated into the characterisation step. Country-specific and global average characterisation factors (CFs) are calculated for 57 land use types considering both land occupation and land transformation interventions with the two suggested approaches. The two indices present similar ranking of land use types but the relative contribution of the separate indicators to the aggregated index varies according to the approach adopted. The differences between the aggregation approaches suggested are discussed, together with the limitations related to both the LANCA ® model and the aggregation approaches. This work represents a first step towards the widespread application of a comprehensive and robust land use model at midpoint level in LCA. Finally, a number of recommendations for the future development of the LANCA ® model and of the related soil quality models are provided. © 2018 The Authors","Land occupation; Land transformation; Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Normalisation; Regionalisation; Soil quality index","Life cycle; Quality assurance; Soils; Land transformation; Life cycle impact assessment; Normalisation; Regionalisation; Soil quality index; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059775075

The research is undertaken by considering 27 institutional factors belonging to six different national institutional systems, and it relies on data from 2413 sustainability reports published by organizations located in 90 different countries. The results show that organizations reporting on the Sustainable Development Goals are more likely to be located in countries with higher levels of climate change vulnerability, national corporate social responsibility, company spending on tertiary education, indulgence and individualism, and lower levels of market coordination, employment protection, power distance and long-term orientation.

We show that while, on aggregate, funded startups receive no less financing during the financial crisis than in non-crisis times, VCs allocate relatively more resources to startups operating in the VCs’ core sectors. We show that this skew allocation follows from VCs choosing to double down on their core-sector investing, rather than by a changed mix of investors or startups during the financial crisis. These effects are strongest for early-stage startups, for which information problems are most severe. Furthermore, these results are driven by the investment strategies of more-experienced VCs.

In order to examine the potential role of crowdfunding in this context, we position this Special Issue (SI) within the larger stream of sustainability transitions literature, and in particular in relation to one of the field's key frameworks, i.e. the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP). We argue that crowdfunding represents a novel socio-technical practice with the potential of upscaling and transforming financial and – potentially – sustainability regimes. This introductory article contains an overview of the articles, described by using the MLP typology. Some authors describe the role of crowdfunding in enabling user-producer and user-consumer interaction at an early stage; others focus on crowdfunding as a tool for user-legitimators and user-citizens. In terms of future research, the novelty of the phenomenon leaves a wide range of areas open for further research, with the current literature primarily focused on uncovering the antecedents of funding success and failure, something that is also apparent in this SI. To help the field move forward, we identify five areas as the most relevant for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"Sustainable development; Consumer interaction; Multilevels; Sociotechnical; Sustainability transition; Sustainable entrepreneurs; Sustainable society; Upscaling; Crowdsourcing; finance; future prospect; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058678749

And is this alternative necessarily better than currently dominant social formations? In this paper, we argue that the Women’s March is partially configured by similar forces of affective circulation as those governing pro-Trump narratives, but that it is different and better in one important respect. The narratives of the Women's March are driven by both collaboration and contestation, meaning its circulation is both centripetal and centrifugal. We substantiate this claim through a close reading of the narration of the Women’s March – from its inception until its first anniversary. Here, we focus particularly on the development from a moment of resistance to a political movement, arguing that this process offers a prototype for conceptualizing a new form of “rebel” or social movement leadership. Hence, the Women’s March not only offers a different and better alternative to the leadership of Trump but also an opportunity for promoting and refining leadership theory in the post-heroic vein. © The Author(s) 2018.","Collective leadership; intersectional feminism; post-heroic leadership; social movements; the Women’s March",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058433129

This study focuses on one type of de-internationalization event – a firm’s decision to exit an export market – and asks how international experience affects its probability of occurrence. In particular, this study complements existing literature by looking at the effect of import-based market experience – considered as a source of market-specific knowledge prior to export market entry – on the probability of a firm exiting an export market. Conceptually, this study contrasts two views on the consequences of increased market knowledge and hypothesizes that, from a learning perspective, import-based market experience ought to reduce export market exit, whereas, from a sunk cost logic, it ought to increase export market exit. Using duration analysis of detailed data on the internationalization history of 1920 Danish firms, I find that the sunk cost logic primarily explains the relationship between import-based market experience and a firm’s probability to exit an export market, and that the effect is strongest for exports to similar destinations. Further analysis shows that this result is partly driven by experimentation-like export behavior by firms with import-based market experience. © 2018, Academy of International Business.","duration models; experiential knowledge; experimentation; export market exit; learning; sunk costs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058049816

However, first-line managers are left with sparse research-based advice on how to develop CoP due to a lack of empirical studies from operations. In response, this paper proposes and tests a framework for intentional development of CoPs in healthcare operations. The proposed framework is structured in six steps, which incorporate seven factors for CoP development as identified in the literature. A double case study test demonstrates that the proposed framework can be applied to develop CoPs within operations, resulting in knowledge sharing between CoP participants, creation of new knowledge, and improvement of practice. In particular, the tests find the following steps to be especially crucial for CoP development: An introduction to the manager of the functions and benefits of CoPs to ensure resource allocation (e.g., time to participate and a meeting room), choosing a practice with relevance for manager and employees, appointing a coordinator, and inviting employees to participate voluntarily. This paper contributes to CoP theory with explanations of how and why specific actions develop CoP within operations. The contribution to practitioners is a step-by-step framework to intentionally develop CoPs within operations to improve knowledge sharing and practice improvement. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055753671

Findings from a sample of 180 SMEs show that earliness, speed of deepening, and speed of geographic diversification can be viewed as three different strategic alternatives and that each dimension is predicted by a different set of entrepreneurial antecedents. Earliness of internationalization is associated with entrepreneurs’ international business experience and their perception of opportunities abroad as well as preference for an innovation strategy characterized by ambidextrous innovation. Speed of deepening is related to entrepreneurs’ international business experience, their orientation towards differentiation vis-à-vis competitors, and commitment to innovation and a strategy focusing on exploration. These results indicate the importance of distinguishing between different forms of innovation.

Yet, stakeholder concerns can establish important barriers to diffusion. We study the human capital aspect of this challenge and investigate whether innovative firms pay salary premiums to new hires with work experience from advocacy groups like Transparency International. We integrate strategic human capital with stakeholder theory and suggest that advocacy group experience creates signals for valuable human capital in terms of stakeholder knowledge and legitimacy transfers to innovative firms. Using matched data for 3,562 employees in Denmark, we find that new hires with advocacy group experience enjoy larger salary premiums at technologically leading firms, in occupations with direct stakeholder interaction, and for advocacy group top management. Managerial Summary: Innovation research is increasingly aware of the non-technological factors behind successful innovations. Users, regulators, or public opinion can be benevolent supporters or stingy opponents of innovations. Employees with an understanding of the needs and sensitivities of societal stakeholders should therefore be valuable to innovative firms. We find this to be the case when innovative firms hire employees from advocacy groups representing such stakeholders (e.g., Transparency International). Such employees receive higher salaries than an otherwise comparable reference group. These findings indicate that recruiting needs of innovative firms reward stakeholder experience, not merely technological expertise. They demonstrate how firms can create value in the pursuit of the public interest. Further, advocacy groups emerge as an important career stage allowing individuals to develop credible signals for stakeholder expertise. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","advocacy groups; human capital; signaling; stakeholder theory; value creation","Human resource management; Signaling; Social aspects; Transparency; Wages; Advocacy groups; Effect on employees; Human capitals; Innovation research; Stakeholder theory; Strategic human capitals; Technological factors; Value creation; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055249786

In an online scenario study, we studied these effects and explored country differences for four different countries (Austria, Germany, UK and USA; N = 2612) in this regards. Our results show that the perceived security of a place becomes a stronger predictor for destination choice during a crisis. Yet, contrary to our assumption, a crisis decreases the importance of a place's perceived openness.

Furthermore, we investigated cross-level moderations of prosocial and impression management motives on our proposed associations. We tested our hypotheses with matched data collected over seven weeks in Istanbul, Turkey. The results from multilevel analyses revealed that (a) expansion oriented relational job crafting is positively related with work performance and voice via work engagement, while (b) contraction oriented relational job crafting is negatively related with work performance and voice via work engagement, all measured at the week level. Furthermore, impression management motives of employees moderated the association between expansion oriented relational job crafting and work engagement in that this positive association is stronger for employees low on impression management motives. Our results contribute to job crafting research in two ways. First, it focuses on relational job crafting and discusses how and why the two opposite types of relational job crafting (expansion versus contraction oriented) impact on work engagement and employees’ key outcomes in the way they do.

Using the promotional video ‘Do it Forever’ as a relevant case, this article analyzes representations of older adults’ sexualities in vacation marketing and points to how advertising is not ‘innocent’, but discursively positions older adults’ sexualities within an antiaging culture which positions older adults as ‘sexy olders’ in sharp opposition to the discourse of ‘asexsual old age’, potentially leaving older adults with little room to construct (a)sexual identities in-between the two strong and oppositional discourses. © The Author(s) 2018.","Discourses; older adults; older adults’ sexualities; senior traveler; sexuality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046762422

However, there are few investigations into what drives citizen expectations and even fewer that consider these relationships across time. This article tests whether prior expectations, perceived performance, and citizen satisfaction influence future expectations, using a unique dataset that follows individual citizens across two subsequent school satisfaction surveys from 2011 and 2013. The results show that prior expectations have a large and consistent influence on future expectations, as predicted by the literature, whereas the influence from prior perceived performance seems less consistent. Prior satisfaction may also influence future expectations, although the effect is minor.

Prior research has shown that change in the formal structure may affect employee networks. Yet, we know relatively little about how such changes affect different network ties. This paper considers how formal structural change affects senior managers’ ability to maintain their intraorganizational networks. The hypotheses are tested on sample of 884 work-related relationships of 96 partners in a global professional services firm. This firm had recently implemented a new strategy, which led to a change in the product-market focus and the resulting formal structure. Our findings reveal that the characteristics of a specific network tie determine whether it is affected by formal structural change. In particular, we find that network ties that are highly embedded in the social structure are more likely to be affected by change in the formal structure. In contrast, ties that are relationally embedded are less likely to be affected by change in the formal structure. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results. In particular, the findings may have consequences for the success of strategy implementation and strategic transformation efforts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Formal structure; Intraorganizational relationships; Organizational change; Professional networks; Strategic transformation; Strategy implementation","Professional aspects; Formal structures; Intraorganizational relationships; Organizational change; Strategic transformation; Strategy implementations; Strategic planning; network analysis; organizational change; social structure; strategic approach; structural change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042168864

The paper has two components - an introductory conceptual part and an empirical part that should be considered as basis for the preliminary validation of the conceptual insights. The research sample includes six firms - three from Canada and three from Denmark. Two different early internationalisation paths have been identified: Lean-to-global (L2G start-ups) and lean-and-global (L & G start-ups). Both types of start-ups were found to have faced significant problems with the complexity, uncertainties and risks of being innovative on a global scale. They have however found ways of addressing these problems by a disciplined knowledge sharing and IP protection strategy and the efficient use of business and supporting and public funding mechanisms. The Danish firms have pivoted around the ways of delivering their value proposition and not around the specific value propositions themselves. The Canadian firms have actively pivoted their value proposition motivated by the degree of innovativeness of their products and the insights from business supporting organisations.

One way to attain cleaner heating solutions for the future is to utilise waste heat from power plants and industry through district heating. In the European Union, approximately 50% of thermal energy is lost in conversion processes. This research paper investigates the potential for the implementation of district heating in a future energy system originally intended not to include district heating. The paper approaches the problem by utilising TIMES modelling to frame the initial future energy system. However, MARKAL/TIMES is not ideal to investigate the operation of different heating scenarios, due to a lack of hourly modelling. Hence, the study utilises EnergyPLAN to investigate the implementation of district heating as an alternative heating scenario to individual heating. EnergyPLAN allows for simulating the hourly operation of not only electricity systems but also heating systems. The study investigates the implementation of district heating in the CO2-80 scenario created with the Irish TIMES model. As the Irish CO2-80 scenario does not include district heating, this study uses EnergyPLAN to simulate an 80% reduction scenario, with and without district heating, to compare the operation of the two systems. A sensitivity analysis is included to reflect on the uncertainties of the study. The results show that a district heating solution is more fuel-efficient while more investment heavy, however the fuel savings more than compensates for the increased investments.

We contend that this omission is a key limitation of the field. We argue that CSR theorization and research on gender can be improved through more explicit and systematic reference to feminist theories, and particularly those from feminist organization studies (FOS). Addressing this gap, we review developments in feminist organization theory, mapping their relevance to CSR. With reference to six major theoretical perspectives in CSR scholarship, we note feminist research relating to each. Drawing upon FOS theory and CSR theory, we then develop an integrated theoretical framework for the analysis of gender issues in CSR. Our framework enables us to identify research strengths in the gender and CSR literature, as well as gaps therein, to open new conversations and to posit future research directions for this emerging area of scholarship. Our paper illustrates how a better grounding of CSR in feminist theory can contribute to CSR research more broadly. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility; Feminist organization studies; Feminist theory; Gender",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015971809

Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the United States and across 24 countries.

Tourism-based activities often utilize the availability of abundant nature, but although most English language studies of destination development are presented from western contexts, examples from post-Soviet Russia are rare. Western Siberia is a periphery with access to natural resources and heavy industrialization but remotely located from domestic (Russian) and international markets, where tourism is often considered a saviour, especially for the regional economies. Stakeholders in this Russian resource periphery face challenges in managing governance and cooperation in destinations development due to frequent institutional, economic and social changes. Using evolutionary economic geography and based on primary sources and interview data, tourism development and stakeholder relations are assessed in three Western Siberia regions: Tomsk, Kemerovo and Altai Krai. Findings show that for tourism to make a significant contribution, it must be more central to the economic development agenda in all three regions. However, it is currently only achieving a permanent high-profile in one of them, being crowded out by other (mostly primary) industries in the other two. Although the specific tourism governance set-up varies between the three regions, it is clear that public tourism governance still sits somewhat uneasily between state control and the market economy. Tourism receives substantial public subsidies, especially in large-scale investment projects, which depend on federal support within a governance system where decentralization seems to be somewhat limited and unstable. As a result, the tourism path development in the Siberian periphery is highly dependent on state intervention and success in other sectors. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","destination governance; path dependency; Russian Federation; Siberia; Tourism destination development","economic geography; industrialization; tourism development; tourism management; tourism market; tourist destination; Russian Federation; Siberia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056134608

This article seeks to fill this research gap by conducting an event study of stock market reactions to CEO succession announcements based on a sample of Danish, Swedish and Finnish firms. Danish stock market rewards externally appointed candidates, whereas the Swedish stock market reacts negatively in the case of internal CEOs. It is argued that national legal and institutional differences put different constraints on the power of CEOs. The impact of internal versus external CEO successors is therefore very much country dependent.

Drawing from the state capitalism literature, we test hypotheses regarding the effect of provincial government ownership and managerial ties respectively on industry relatedness of firm acquisitions. We furthermore test hypotheses concerning the moderating effect of institutional development and governor age and tenure. We test our hypotheses based on analysis of 346 majority acquisition deals completed by first-time acquirers in China between 2002 and 2014. Our results show that provincial government-owned firms and firms with ties to the same are more likely to conduct unrelated acquisitions within their home province compared to acquisitions across provincial boundaries. Similar patterns do not exist for privately owned firms or for firms with no managerial ties to provincial governments. Institutional development and governor age and tenure are found to have no moderating effects. We relate our findings to the main theoretical views of state capitalism and suggest that our results reflect government attempts to promote economic growth and social development.

Li has repeatedly asserted that Yin-Yang is superior to all other cognitive frames in dealing with paradox in general and that his “Yin-Yang balancing” solution is superior to ambidexterity as an approach to paradox management in particular. Disagreeing with Peter P. Li, this paper debunks the “Yin-Yang balancing being superior to ambidexterity” assertion by making three critical points. First, at the philosophical level, Peter P. Li’s notion of “Yin-Yang balancing” is an inaccurate interpretation (or incomplete version) of the Confucian principle of Zhong-Yong that is largely compatible with Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean. Second, at the practical level, his “Yin-Yang balancing” solution, while being different from the structural ambidexterity approach, is compatible with the contextual ambidexterity approach. These first two points imply that Peter P. Li’s “Yin-Yang balancing” solution is not necessarily superior to the ambidexterity approach in particular and the Western thinking in general. Third, Robert Blake and Jane Mouton, in their 1964 book The Managerial Grid, provide a variety of approaches to managing a fundamental organizational paradox (i.e., the production-people conflict). Their analysis not only covers different ambidexterity approaches, but also offers much more insights on paradox management. More significant is that Blake and Mouton made explicit that those ambidexterity-type approaches only deal with the problem at the level of symptoms rather than root causes. This third point implies that some Western scholars have had much deeper thinking on paradox management than some Chinese colleagues may have imagined. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Ambidexterity; China; Indigenous; Paradox; Yin-Yang; Zhong-Yong",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045770857

While scholars have learned much by analyzing one or a few specific behavioral dimensions of public management at a time, we argue for the value of a more holistic and inductive approach that uses data on several aspects of public management for identifying manager types. Such an approach accounts for both the cognitive processes of people affected by management and the reality that managers’ individual behavioral decisions are interrelated. We examine the overlap of 21 aspects of public school management behavior using cluster analysis. We identify four different manager types (“firefighters,” “laissez-faire managers,” “administrators,” and “proactive floor managers”), each reflecting a distinct constellation of managerial behaviors. The manager types we call “administrators” and “proactive floor managers” are associated with relatively better outcomes, while “firefighters” are associated with relatively worse outcomes. © 2017, Copyright © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036572200

Our research objective is, therefore, to investigate the interplay between environmental practices and quality in the pursuit of firm performance. Relying on 492 responses from Turkish manufacturers to test our hypotheses, we show that environmental practices directly improve the quality of products over and above the effect of quality management practices in emerging markets. Product quality, in turn, is important for increasing firm performance, acting as a mediator for the positive effects of environmental practices on performance. Thus, we reveal that product quality functions as an instrumental conduit between environmental practices and firm performance in emerging markets like Turkey where stakeholder pressures are weak, and regulations are often not properly enforced. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emerging markets; Environmental practices; firm performance; product quality; quality management","Commerce; Environmental regulations; Quality control; Quality management; Emerging markets; Environmental practices; Firm Performance; Production strategy; Quality management practices; Quality of product; Research objectives; Stakeholder pressures; Environmental management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064534485

Although PMI has been identified as crucial to understand merger success or failure, the literature on PMI drivers remains inconclusive. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the theory of paradox and two key elements of PMI, strategic interdependency (SI) and organizational autonomy (OA), the authors describe the merger of two listed French companies using longitudinal data. Findings: The authors identify how the paradox between OA and SI was triggered and fostered PMI success by leading to symbiotic integration. They also show that two capabilities were central in helping the paradox to evolve: preserving the specificities of the organizations and pooling their respective capabilities. These capabilities result from basic decisions and actions during the integration implementation, such as highlighting the expertise of the target firm, refocusing the core activity while valorizing each company’s expertise, clarifying the identity of the new organization on the market and enhancing joint piloting and transferring both general management capacity and functional abilities during the reorganization period. Practical implications: The authors offer several useful insights for managers trying to manage paradoxical tension throughout the merger process. This study encourages managers to embrace inconsistencies as they make decisions and to shift to dynamic decision-making as a way to adapt to complex contexts. Originality/value: This study adopts a global and inclusive approach to focus on OA and SI and flesh out a picture of the integration process. It proposes a dynamic process model to conceptualize the stage-wise nature of the PMI process by highlighting the interrelations between OA and SI dynamics. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Longitudinal case study; Merger process; Paradoxical approach; Postmerger integration; Symbiotic integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066890761

The long-term trajectory of human civilization can be defined as the path that human civilization takes during the entire future time period in which human civilization could continue to exist.

Findings: Status quo trajectories appear unlikely to persist into the distant future, especially in light of long-term astronomical processes. Several catastrophe, technological transformation and astronomical trajectories appear possible. Originality/value: Some current actions may be able to affect the long-term trajectory.

Agricultural residues as an energy resource have attracted a lot of interest, as the use of residue biomass is perceived as beneficial to mitigate greenhouse gas emission and to be less harmful to the environment than other biomass resources. Here we present a holistic sustainability assessment of the use of cereal straw for heat and electricity production in Denmark. The assessment applies a methodology and framework developed by the Global Bioenergy Partnership. Sixteen sustainability indicators within the three pillars of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) are quantified or assessed qualitatively together with their development over time from year 2000–2014/2015. The assessment points to a number of benefits of straw based bioenergy as reductions in GHG emissions, income generation and jobs for a rural population, reduced use of fossil fuels and increased diversity of the national energy supply. These benefits come at a risk of soil degradation and soil organic matter mining, of increased emissions of non-greenhouse gases. The assessment shows that land allocation to straw harvest for energy has increased over time together with land productivity. The diversity of the national energy supply has increased over time just as the infrastructure required to support straw to energy supply chains. Ecologically there is a potential for further use of agricultural residue biomass for energy. To realise the potential sustainably, attention should be put on developing guidelines or regulation on biomass harvest, on avoidance of environmental burden shifting, on logistics and efficient conversion to energy services, and on maintaining a suitable organisational and policy framework. The framework of the Global Bioenergy Partnership proved to be a versatile tool for the assessment of bioenergy sustainability, also in a developed country. It is, however, relying on specific data sources and formats, which in many cases are not readily available. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural residues; Bioenergy; Global bioenergy partnership (GBEP); Heat and power production; Sustainability","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Crops; Electric power generation; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Supply chains; Agricultural crop residues; Bio-energy; Energy supply chains; Environmental burdens; Heat and power; Holistic sustainability; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability indicators; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059651364

The dominance of energy supply from non-renewable resources in the region means that the increasing energy demand has implications for energy security, as well as adverse local and global environmental effects. Climatic conditions in the region are favorable for renewable energy (RE) resources, especially but not only wind and solar technologies. ASEAN countries differ strongly in terms of their national policy frameworks and progress in renewable energy development; the overall target of 23% renewables by 2025 is very ambitious under current policy frameworks. This paper identifies a gap between these national policies and local governance, especially in urban areas, which requires attention to ensure future target fulfilment. By employing a new combined correlation and decomposition approach at country and city levels, we investigate the determinants of RE expansion and explore the trend drivers in ASEAN countries from 1995 to 2013. An Impact Matrix is developed to position and interpret the relative push (e.g. policy) and pull (e.g. market) impacts on RE development, and to derive policy recommendations for countries and sectors. The results highlight that urban areas should be the focus of RE policy and governance in addition to rural areas. The tremendous impact of economic growth creates a great impetus for renewable energy development, but urbanization is the second pull for renewable energy extensions. Since the two effects are located in the first quadrant of the Impact Matrix, if strategists affect these factors, they will create the most powerful incentive for renewable energy growth. This confirms that if the strategic aim is to promote renewable energy market development, through policy and governance measures, the focus should be on urban areas, non-electricity sectors and the demand side. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","ASEAN; Correlation decomposition; Governance; Renewable energy; Urbanization effect","Commerce; Energy policy; Energy security; Public policy; Sustainable development; ASEAN; Governance; National policy framework; Renewable energies; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy markets; South-East Asian Nations; Urbanization effect; Renewable energy resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059558817

The drastic depletion of fossil fuels, in particular, has made it imperative that we find alternative ways of manufacturing that can support upcoming industries without causing further loss or damage to our natural resources. This critical situation has given rise to a pressing need for a cohesive and strategic research that can address the needs of industries while simultaneously ensuring the implementation of environmentally sustainable manufacturing methods. However, the adoption of environmentally sustainable concepts is a challenging task for industries and a thorough, comprehensive and insightful research is essential in order to support and facilitate this task. From the literature available, it can be assumed with certainty that industries are currently making substantial efforts to ensure that their manufacturing-related operations are as green and as sustainable as possible. The literature review contained in this paper endeavours to assess, from a global perspective, the various challenges that hinder these efforts while bearing in mind the positive trend in industrial operations. It may also be worth noting that there are not much research so far on green concept in sustainable manufacturing and this paper adds value to the existing research by focusing on this hitherto neglected area. © 2019, Operational Research Society of India.","Challenging factors; Evaluation; Green; Review; Sustainable development",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063148296

In this paper we address the questions: how will a design strategy as a concept look? and, what added value does a more structured and pragmatic work method add to the use of BIM throughout design and construction processes? A literature review established the main areas to further address through a case study method. Two cases were used, a live project and a theoretical project developed by students with the participation of the researchers as teachers. The outcome was to develop a pragmatic design strategy that is as uncomplicated as possible, but can lead a digital construction process and BIM project through the design phases and into the construction and O&M phases with the use of structured data and information from the models in an interdisciplinary manner. In order to develop a common language and understanding about the digital construction process, a paradigm for a BIM roadmap was also further developed.

Interestingly, they also both represent fields of study in which academics representing those fields have worked very hard so as extend rather than delineate the same. In fact, some parts of the debate on, e.g., entrepreneurship could be criticized for engaging in “conceptual colonization,” insofar as it actively attempts to fit more and more activities under the umbrella term of entrepreneurship and/or projects, with the attendant implicit inference that they are thus fodder and resource for studies of the same. The purpose of this paper is to seek to inquire into this phenomenon. Design/methodology/approach: In and of itself this could be seen as merely a case of academic (over-)branding, but the author will in the following paper argue that this also leads to “epistemological emptying,” i.e., a state where terms such as entrepreneurship and project start becoming less and less meaningful as they become more and more general, and that the strive among researchers to extend their fields can be seen as a form of symbolic violence against the same. Findings: The author argues that the author can find conceptual colonization and epistemological emptying by paying critical attention to the manner in which key contributions in the field(s) consistently and uncritically try to extend the boundaries of said field(s). Originality/value: By reflection on the manner in which field(s) attempts to make themselves more general may backfire and bring about epistemological emptying, the author might develop a more robust discussion regarding the importance of field boundaries and also more critically note power/knowledge ambitions in the field(s). © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical management studies; Critical project studies; Entrepreneurship; Epistemology; Methodologies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049530595

A large multi-country sample is used to empirically test our theory-induced hypotheses. The findings support that social and technical integration are indeed significant enablers for the positive relationships that quality and sustainability programmes have on quality performance and sustainability performance. Specifically, the results show that while social integration has both direct and indirect effects on quality and sustainability performance, technical integration impacts quality and sustainability performance only through the mediation effect of the respective programmes.

To employees accustomed to being told to be rational and objective, design-thinking methods can seem uncomfortably emotive. Being asked not to quickly converge on an answer can be difficult for people accustomed to valuing a clear direction, cost savings, and finishing sooner rather than later. Iterative prototyping and testing call on employees to repeatedly experience something they've historically tried to avoid: failure.

Their traditional applications are in queueing, insurance risk, and reliability, but more recently, also in finance and, though to a lesser extent, to life and health insurance. The advantage is that PH distributions form a dense class and that problems having explicit solutions for exponential distributions typically become computationally tractable under PH assumptions. In the first part of this paper, fitting of PH distributions to human lifetimes is considered. The class of generalized Coxian distributions is given special attention. In part, some new software is developed. In the second part, pricing of life insurance products such as guaranteed minimum death benefit and high-water benefit is treated for the case where the lifetime distribution is approximated by a PH distribution and the underlying asset price process is described by a jump diffusion with PH jumps. The expressions are typically explicit in terms of matrix-exponentials involving two matrices closely related to the Wiener-Hopf factorization, for which recently, a Lévy process version has been developed for a PH horizon.

However, we know little about whether organizational practices also transfer from parents to spawns, and if so, what types of practices are transferred? Using a combination of survey and registrar data and through a detailed identification strategy, we examine these two previously unaddressed questions. Our results provide strong evidence for organizational heritage in practices. About 70% of the comparisons of start-ups and other established organizations are less similar than the average similarity between a parent organization and its spawn and that the overlap in organizational practices is almost 10% greater between a spawn and its parents than between the spawn and other established firms. Our further investigation shows that not all practices seem to find their way into the new entrepreneurial firms. In particular, practices that are valuable for and fit with the requirements of a start-up organization, and at the same time are more clearly defined and casually less ambiguous, are more likely to be transferred by the founders from their previous employers. These results contribute to our understanding of how entrepreneurs assemble their organizations and practice innovation as well as the diffusion of practices and the origins of firm heterogeneity. © 2019, INFORMS.","Entrepreneurship; Organizational routines; Strategic human resources management; Strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064657926

The research reported herein develops the parsimonious, reliable, and valid TE scale, and provides an empirical test thereof. The results show that TE is an important means to investigate both tourists’ and residents’ behavior. It drives tourists’ willingness to engage in and recommend domestic tourism, as well as residents’ support for domestic tourism development. The results further reveal that higher levels of tourists’ “perceived self-efficacy to contribute to the domestic economy” and lower levels of “perceived economy support of others” strengthen TE’s effect.

We employ data on production and trade in the Danish chocolate and confectionery industry to obtain estimates of domestic ‘product appeal’ (reflecting non-price factors of domestic performance). Domestic product appeal is influenced not only by inherent characteristics of the product, but also by the tastes and preferences of domestic consumers. For many consumer goods, tastes depend on customs, culture etc. A product's domestic appeal is therefore an imperfect predictor of foreign demand (and hence of export performance), especially in destinations where tastes differ substantially from domestic tastes. We combine estimates of domestic product appeal with information on destination-specific exports and a novel measure of differences in tastes across countries to confirm this hypothesis. Results are consistent across both a Tobit model with destination-specific censoring point and the BLP estimator, which additionally reveals substantial heterogeneity in tastes for product appeal within countries across consumers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Demand estimation; Exports; Firm heterogeneity","Industrial engineering; Industry; Consumer Goods; Demand estimation; Domestic markets; Domestic product; Export performance; Exports; Firm heterogeneity; Inherent characteristics; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059812806

To reduce the negative impact of waste in construction, production managers need to address the causes of the variation that results in such waste. This paper explains the way to reduce the effects of variation in construction by changing the task sequence arrangement. The study analyzed the effect of some different task sequence arrangements on the production gap, crew waiting time, and production delay by simulating a group of work tasks and changing the task sequence arrangement from linear to parallel. Accordingly, 100 work activities were simulated in 98 different sequence designs, using a stochastic discrete-event simulation model, during which the number of parallel activities was systematically increased. The main finding from the studied configuration is that arranging tasks in parallel increases waste, whereas it reduces project duration. Moreover, waste resulting from variation was found to be an additional cause of waste when accelerating the production. Finally, it was revealed that the impact of variation on the task sequence highly depends on how often the schedule is updated. This study helps production managers to better understand of how the task sequence arrangement affects production performance in onsite construction operations. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Construction; Managers; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Discrete-event simulation model; On-site construction; Production gap; Production manager; Production performance; Project duration; Sequence designs; Work activities; Discrete event simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059506167

Recently, industrial symbiosis literature was enriched with views and discussions on dynamics, focusing on the process and dynamic character of industrial symbiosis development. However, little attention is given specifically to the emergence of industrial symbiosis, in contrast to its development. In addition, no holistic picture exists envisioning the process through which initial ties come about and the critical factors fuelling this process. The aim of this paper is to set focus on and promote a better understanding of industrial symbiosis emergence as the earliest phase of its development. This study explores two aspects of the industrial symbiosis emergence: the process through which initial ties emerge and the critical factors influencing the transition between phases in the process. Based on an in-depth and systematic review of the existing empirically-based literature and by using a rigorous and iterative content analysis, three key (iterative)phases are identified: 1) awareness and interest in industrial symbiosis, 2) reaching out and exploration of (connections, and 3) organizing. Furthermore, five groups of critical factors (contextual conditions, actors, actors' roles, actors' characteristics, and actors’ activities) are identified to influence the emergence process in different degrees at different times in the process. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Critical factors; Emergence; Industrial symbiosis","Production engineering; Circular economy; Content analysis; Critical factors; Dynamic character; Emergence; Industrial ecology; Industrial symbiosis; Systematic Review; Industrial engineering",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059313668

The LCA and LCC included all activities in the life cycle of the SHP and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), namely construction, operation and end-of-life. The thermal energy produced by the SHP was assessed as supplying heating and cooling for an air-conditioning system, displacing a conventional air-source heat pump powered by electricity from the grid. This integrated system was compared to a reference situation where wastewater is treated in a conventional WWTP applying activated sludge with no thermal energy recovery system, showing clear environmental benefits in all impact indicators, such as a 42% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions and a cost reduction of 53%. Several sensitivity analyses confirmed these findings, with the exception of the price rebound effect, which showed that the lower cost of the integrated system could lead to overturning the environmental benefits. As a limitation of the study, the distribution of the supplied air-conditioning to meet a demand off-site the WWTP premises, such as in residential buildings or hotels, was not included.

Building on the Norm Activation Model (NAM), the current study explores the expression of personal norms as well as intentions to reduce clothing consumption. It extends the NAM with the concept of identification with and care for all humanity (IWAH). By employing structural equation modeling (n = 4123), it finds evidence for positive relationships between IWAH and NAM variables. Moreover, outcome efficacy has the strongest positive relationship with personal norms, which in turn relate to intentions for reducing consumption.

We investigated contemporary adjustments to six listed buildings. These works were undertaken to keep these buildings functional while at the same time protecting their listing; by doing so they contributed to maintain the institution of Architectural Heritage. Our analysis identifies three forms of authentication: material consolidation, crafts mobilization and character enhancement. We elaborate on each of them and explain their institutional underpinnings and outcomes. The paper concludes with an articulation of authentication as a potent form of institutional maintenance work. Taking its starting point in materiality, authentication is a relational practice that helps maintain institutions relying on irreplaceable artefacts for their maintenance. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies","architectural heritage; authenticity; institutional maintenance; materiality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058656546

Our findings suggest that ventures receiving CVC investments draw less on investors' knowledge, while inventor mobility increases the extent to which an incumbent's technological knowledge is used by recipient ventures. Ventures combining CVC investments and inventor mobility from the same incumbent are selected for drawing less on that incumbent's patents, but these citation flows increase in the period after investment and the inventors' hiring events are combined. Our results, thus, unveil the organizational complexity associated with the individual and combined roles of CVC investments and inventor mobility in determining new ventures' innovation behaviors.

The model provides a framework to analyse the determinants of a firm's decision to export and import while allowing for its current decision to affect its future productivity. Considering a panel of Danish manufacturing firms over the period 2000–07, a simple description of the data reveals considerable firm heterogeneity; significant export and import activity premia; frequent incidence of simultaneous exporting and importing; and high persistence in the scope of firm trading. Structural estimation of the model shows a marked difference in the demand elasticities in which export markets are characterised by more elastic demand, tougher competition and lower markup than the domestic market. The estimates also indicate that firms with larger capital holding and paying higher wages are cost-efficient even after controlling for their productivity. Additionally, the estimates imply substantial sunk and fixed costs of exporting and importing, and these are consistent with the hypothesis of self-selection of productive firms into trading.

Emergency orders are controlled by a reorder point policy with a target stock level, whereas normal orders are issued according to a reorder point policy with a fixed order quantity. We assume that emergency orders have a short constant lead time and are more expensive than normal orders for which the extra lead time is specified as a stochastic multiple of the review period. In addition to variable and fixed costs for emergency orders and fixed costs for normal orders, our model includes linear holding and backlogging costs. Pure policies issuing either emergency orders or normal orders are used for benchmarking and initialization purposes of two combined policies, OPT and SIMP, which allow at most one normal order with remaining lead time longer than the lead time for emergency orders. The combined policies are computed by applying Markov decision models and, for some model-exogenous control variables, neighborhood search. The numerical study shows a large potential for cost improvement from using normal orders and emergency orders in combination. The relative cost increase of the new SIMP compared with the previously studied OPT is often about 1%. Because SIMP is easier than OPT to administer and explain, it is more appropriate than OPT for practical applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Backlogging; Emergency order; Markov decision model; Policy iteration; Reorder-point policy; Stochastic lead times","Cost accounting; Inventory control; Optimization; Stochastic models; Backlogging; Emergency order; Markov decision model; Policy iteration; Reorder points; Stochastic lead-times; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044712544

However, it has some shortcomings if much heterogeneity exists among the items. Consequently, a new heuristic control policy is constructed. The cornerstone is a policy iteration improvement step, assuming a single possibility for making a joint order and thus to deviate from the rule that the items are governed by independent, re-order and order-up-to, (s,S) policies. But this policy iteration improvement step is done repeatedly at each demand epoch. It is only required the development of one-dimensional value functions of state variables in order to accomplish the policy iteration improvement step. Knowledge about good order-up-to values is important. Furthermore, a relaxation parameter α is introduced such that one can, make it easier or more difficult to issue a joint order, when following the policy iteration improvement step. Finally, in case a joint order is made, a vector of can-order points is used to include additional items. The policy is denoted a (c,S,α) policy. Numerical results shows that the new policy performs significantly better than the Q(s,S) policy for cases with heterogeneity among items. Furthermore, from a given optimal can-order policy, one can construct a better (c,S,α) policy. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Heterogeneity; Inventory control; Joint replenishment; Stochastic demand","Inventory control; Stochastic systems; Heterogeneity; Heuristic control; Joint replenishment; Joint replenishment problem; Numerical results; Policy iteration; Relaxation parameter; Stochastic demand; Stochastic control systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033434825

In such a system both an on-hand inventory item and a positive service time are required to fulfill customer demands. The service-inventory system also captures main features of the classical inventory systems with a positive processing time, e.g., make-to-order systems. In this study the service-inventory system is modeled as an M/M/1 queue in which the customer arrival rate is price dependent. The inventory of an individual item is continuously reviewed under an (r,Q) policy. The replenishment lead times of the inventory are exponentially distributed. Furthermore, customers arriving during stock-out periods are lost. The stochastic customer inter-arrival times, service times, and inventory replenishment lead times cause the high complexity of the problem and the difficulty in solving it. The aim of this study is to formulate the problem and solve it to optimality. We make three main contributions: (1) We integrate inventory control and pricing in the service-inventory system. The problem is formulated and analyzed as a fractional programming problem, and structural properties are explored for the model. (2) Two solution algorithms are proposed. The first one provides optimal solutions, while the second one is more efficient.

The factors’ relevance was tested using a quantitative methodology and a sample of 317 Vilnius residents. This city was next divided into three zones, and data collected from 18 real estate experts was subjected to qualitative analysis. The analytic hierarchy process was then applied to identify transportation system factors’ level of impact and dynamics by the housing location. Findings: The results show that the factors affect the housing market in question but that these effects vary by the housing location and the most critical factors differ for each city zone. Research limitations/implications: Only data on Vilnius were used. Further research is needed to compare transportation factors’ dynamics in multiple cities. Practical implications: Priorities in transportation system improvements should be assessed to facilitate sustainable urban development and enhance the residents’ quality of life. Housing market regulations can only be successful if investment in transportation systems is allocated purposefully and coherently.

Theory suggests that designing products according to DFV practices increases operational performance by allowing more efficient processing of products, capitalizing on commonalities and by supporting cross-functional and cross-boundary coordination through simplifying product designs. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the latter proposition, and especially the mediating role of internal, supplier and customer integration in the relationship between DFV and operational performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data collected in 2014 among 702 manufacturers from 22 countries as part of the 6th International Manufacturing Strategy Survey are analyzed through mediated regression analysis using SPSS 25, AMOS and PROCESS v3.1 software. Findings: DFV affects cost/speed, quality, delivery, flexibility and service performance positively. Except for the role of customer integration in the DFV-cost/speed relationship, internal, supplier and customer integration partially mediate the relationship between DFV and operational performance. Practical implications: In addition to allowing a more efficient processing of products, the positive effect of DFV on performance is also explained by the fact that DFV practices support cross-functional and supply chain integration. These practices allow manufacturers to create a set of design rules easily understood and communicated within and across organizational boundaries. Originality/value: While previous research tends to consider one DFV practice and limited sets of integration mechanisms and performance dimensions, this paper consolidates the most common DFV practices into one construct and encompasses the three forms of integration and six performance dimensions dominating the DFV literature. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Integration; Mediated regression analysis; Performance; Product design; Survey","Integration; Manufacture; Regression analysis; Sales; Supply chains; Surveying; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Integration mechanisms; International manufacturing strategy surveys; Operational performance; Organizational boundaries; Performance; Performance dimensions; Supply-chain integration; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057035498

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","The carbon footprints of seven wastewater treatment plants using different technologies in Denmark and Sweden were evaluated. The life cycle assessment approach was applied by using site-specific data including measured plant-integrated methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Four different functional units were adopted: 1 Mg of input material entering the wastewater treatment plant in 2015, and the removal of 1 kg of carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus. The net carbon footprint values found in this study were between 0.15 and 0.66 kg CO2 eq (Mg of input material)−1 depending on the treatment facility. Direct greenhouse gas emissions were the main contributors to the carbon footprint, accounting for between 44 and 71% of the total burden. The remaining share of the total burden (66 and 29%) was mainly made by energy consumption, chemicals used, and emissions from effluent and land application of biosolids. Direct greenhouse gas emissions were very sensitive model parameters driving result uncertainties. When default values from emission reporting guidelines were applied instead of measured greenhouse gas emission rates, the net carbon footprint was up to four times smaller or seven times larger. The consumption of electricity from the energy grid for plant operation had a great impact on the carbon footprint, due to differences between the energy systems. The share of electricity consumption to the total carbon footprint burden for the Swedish plants was only 2%, whereas it was between 16 and 28% for the Danish plants. This difference was due to the smaller carbon footprint potential of the electricity mix in Sweden than in Denmark. Normalisation of the carbon footprint to the plant pollution load, and the calculation of model uncertainty, allowed for a reliable comparison of plants operating within the same energy system. Finally, suggestions were provided for performing a sound carbon footprint evaluation of wastewater treatment plants. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","EASETECH; Emission factors; Environmental assessment; Greenhouse gas reporting; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide emissions","Effluents; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Magnesium compounds; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; EASETECH; Emission factors; Environmental assessment; Greenhouse gas reporting; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059327275

Sustainable design requires choosing energy efficient ventilation strategies. Diffuse ceiling ventilation (DCV) has a great energy saving potential due to the low pressure drop (∼2 Pa) through the ceiling panel. A DCV system has three components: plenum, suspended ceiling and ventilated room. Conditioned air is supplied to plenum, then diffuses into the ventilated room through the suspended ceiling made of porous materials. The system can be designed to handle high cooling loads without inducing thermal discomfort. This review references research articles on DCV published from 2008 to 2018 to highlight the research outcomes and to identify the research gaps. One major objective of this review paper is to document simplified theoretical modelling methods for proposing quick DCV system design tool. The flow in the plenum can be described as impingement jet over porous materials. A design procedure is proposed to determine the size and number of nozzles. The heat transfer in the porous ceiling is treated as two-phase energy transport. Buoyancy force generated by the heat sources in the room has been identified to drive the airflow circulation, which motivates the thoughtful review of fundamental theories of thermal plumes in a stratified environment. The major task on thermal plumes is to calculate the height and induced volume flow rate, which are summarized according to the type of heat sources, e.g., point or area sources. The principle behind heating efficiency of DCV might be explained by theories of turbulent fountains. The rising height of warm air coming out of diffuse ceiling is determined by the source Froude number. The popular research methods to study DCV system are full-scale experiments and CFD modelling.

Of N harvested in agricultural plant products, 80% is used to feed livestock. Because the largest atmospheric loss of reactive nitrogen from livestock production systems is ammonia (NH3), the focus of this paper is on N lost as NH3 during the production of animal protein. The focus of this paper is to understand the key factors explaining differences in Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) of animal production among various European countries. Therefore we developed a conceptual framework to describe the NUE defined as the amount of animal-protein N per N in feed and NH3–N losses in the production of milk, beef, pork, chicken meat and eggs in The Netherlands, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Denmark. The framework describes how manure management and animal-related parameters (feed, metabolism) relate to NH3 emissions and NUE. The results showed that the animal product with the lowest NUE had the largest NH3 emissions and vice versa, which agrees with the reciprocal relationship between NUE and NH3 within the conceptual framework. Across animal products for the countries considered, about 20% of the N in feed is lost as NH3. The significant smallest proportion (12%) of NH3–N per unit of Nfeed is from chicken production. The proportions for other products are 17%, 19%, 20% and 22% for milk, pork, eggs and beef respectively. These differences were not significantly different due to the differences among countries. For all countries, NUE was lowest for beef and highest for chicken. The production of 1 kg N in beef required about 5 kg N in feed, of which 1 kg N was lost as NH3–N. For the production of 1 kg N in chicken meat, 2 kg N in feed was required and 0.2 kg was lost as NH3. The production of 1 kg N in milk required 4 kg N in feed with 0.6 kg NH3–N loss, the same as pork and eggs, but those needed 3 and 3.5 kg N in feed per kg N in product respectively. Except for beef, the differences among these European countries were mainly caused by differences in manure management practices and their emission factors, rather than by animal-related factors including feed and digestibility influencing the excreted amount of ammoniacal N (TAN). For beef, both aspects caused important differences. Based on the results, we encourage the expression of N losses as per N in feed or per N in product, in addition to per animal place, when comparing production efficiency and NUE. We consider that disaggregating emission factors into a diet/animal effect and a manure management effect would improve the basis for comparing national NH3 emission inventories. © 2018 The Authors","Ammonia emission intensity; Animal protein; Feed nitrogen; Manure management; Nitrogen use efficiency","Agriculture; Animals; Beef; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Manures; Nitrogen; Proteins; Ammonia emissions; Animal proteins; Conceptual frameworks; Emission inventories; Livestock production; Manure management; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Production efficiency; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057784573

The paper takes its point of departure from a synthesis of the literature around innovation, intellectual capital (IC), knowledge management and business models. Design/methodology/approach: The research streams of innovation performance and business performance are combined to provide insights bridging these two traditions. This paper provides empirical evidence from two case studies of business development projects that involved both intervention- and non-intervention-based data collection methods. Findings: The research traditions of both innovation performance and business performance identify knowledge, learning and IC as the basis for all value creation activities in organisations. This paper provides a synthesis of the literature in these fields and relates them to each other in accordance with the “process of creating”. This structure allows the discussion of innovation performance and business performance separately and in conjunction with one another, as well providing opportunities for identifying relevant key performance indicators. Research limitations/implications: Caution should be taken in the nature of the developed conceptual framework which rests upon the perspective of the author’s subjective interpretation of the current literature. Originality/value: These insights are relevant for the development of a performance management structure capable of straddling the common exploration–exploitation paradox, which, in this context, often becomes a compromise between performance optimization and a developmental focus.

It also suggests that mimetic forms of isomorphism are present in the sense that municipalities believe that if they comply with these requirements they will strengthen the conditions of their local clubs. In turn, they have encouraged other municipalities to follow suit.

I will draw on theories about retrospective sensemaking and its cognitive foundation in counterfactual belief formation. Issues related to horizontal or intraunit unfairness emerge in situations in which the actions of one employee influence the outcome of another due to relational interdependence. The authors of theories about horizontal unfairness have continued the traditional distinction between the three facets of justice, procedural, distributive, and interactional. However, might employee A blame employee B because she (B) obtained qualitative (e.g., non-monetary appraisal) or quantitative (e.g., monetary compensation) recognition even though the latter did not, directly at least, bring about the event. The problem here is one of causality which asks the question, Can A be blamed by B for bringing about the event of outcome difference? While blame in evaluations of vertical justice certainly presumes causal agency, it might be questioned whether the same goes for horizontal unfairness. Counterfactual belief formation enables a step into the cognitive and retrospective nature of evaluations of horizontal justice events centered on the counterfactual belief “had the unfavorable event X not occurred, another and more favorable event X 1 would have occurred.” This is related to the distance between the actual X and the potential event state X), in the sense that the closer the two appear, the more convincing becomes A’s belief to himself. The underlying causality of rewarding processes, however, states that some third party introduces the recognition, for example, a manager, and, therefore, B did not bring about the reward event, the third party did. It seems, then, that to understand this, we should take into consideration: 1) the formation of counterfactual beliefs and 2) the causality of blame. The article concludes that, due to the underlying causality of rewarding processes, one might solely consider one facet of horizontal justice, interactional horizontal justice. However, tapping into the phenomenological dimension of morality might allow one also to address the moral nature of distributive and procedural facets of horizontal justice as the experience of the psychosocial fabric of social reality related with feeling either “as if” one is being treated unfairly or “as if” one is treating others unfairly. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Blameability; Counterfactual belief formation; Horizontal fairness; Retrospective sense-making; Reward policies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061669184

At the same time, political and public actors praise the civic virtues and democratic skills that volunteers obtain when participating in any kind of voluntary organization. This notion of voluntary organizations as “schools for democracy” already lacks empirical grounding. Given the increased instrumentalization of voluntary social work, it becomes even more important to ask what the modes of participation look like among volunteers within the new organizational forms. In this article, we review key trends and changes at the institutional level and present data from a long-term ethnographic study that explores the mode of participation of volunteers within an organizational form that responds to the demands of the current civic landscape.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a literature study and a study of three of Saab’s offset cases and Saab’s process for technology transfer. Findings: This study has identified inter-organizational transfer strategies based on the importance of the hierarchy of decision-making and the change from capacity transfers to capability transfers in offset business. The type of performance goals set in the business agreement decides how to realize the transfer. The hierarchy of decision-making creates a need to align the understanding of the performance goals between the different parts of the organization, which affect the plans for how to transfer knowledge between the organizational as well as the individual levels. To reach the performance goals of the technology transfer, there needs to be a balance between the disseminative capability of the sender and the absorptive capability of the receiver.

Achieving a higher level of innovative capacity within the water sector may govern a country's capacity to meet specific water challenges while becoming still more important for ensuring sustainable economic development. Traditional water technologies are reaching their stagnation point; in a transition to more sustainable technologies, eco-innovation is the core driver. Based on the national innovative capacity (NIC) as an analytical framework, - indicators that govern the innovative capacity of the water sector were tested in a comparative analysis of Europe versus China, representing respectively, an early mover and a late mover in the green economy agenda. Additionally, an analysis of the evolution of the water technological development is provided. The innovative capacity in the water sector was found to be strongly related to the national innovative strategy. Environmental regulations, research and development and international collaboration were all found to be determinants for both Europe's and China's NIC in the water sector. The level of direct investments and private research and development, on the other hand, were found to be a determinant for China only. However, the evolution of the NIC determinants could not provide any insight as to whether China may reach the same level of NIC in the water sector as Europe. This analysis contributes nonetheless to increasing the level of understanding in the field of water innovation dynamics - providing insights - as to why Europe and China present different innovative capacities in the water sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Eco-innovations; Europe; National innovative capacity; Water sector; Water technologies","Economic and social effects; Economics; Environmental regulations; International cooperation; Negative impedance converters; Sustainable development; China; Eco-innovation; Europe; National innovative capacity; Water sector; Water technologies; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057189961

This paper examines the biogas potential of biomass from Danish buffer strips with different types of natural vegetation and the possibility of using the functional trait composition of the vegetation and the nutrient composition of the biomass as indicators for the quantity of the biomass and its biogas potential. Biomass was harvested from 73 plots in 2014 and 2015 and biomass yield, nutrient content (CNP) and methane yields were determined. Prior to harvesting, the plant communities were characterised in terms of species composition, and a cluster analysis was performed to identify species assemblages in terms of vegetation clusters. Four ecologically meaningful clusters were obtained: a tall herb fringe community, a tall grass community, a low herb and grass community and a rich fen/wet meadow community. The biomass yield was numerically higher in the tall herb fringe and the tall grass communities, while the specific methane yield was higher in the tall grass and low herb and grass communities. When all samples were analysed together, the biomass yield was positively correlated with some of the vegetation traits (Ellenberg value soil reaction and leaf dry matter content) and negatively with nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the biomass. In addition, a negative correlation was observed between the biomass yield and the specific methane yield. In contrast, the biomass yield was positively correlated with the methane yield per ha, indicating that even small differences in biomass yield can be more relevant for the methane yield per ha than differences in specific methane yields in natural vegetation. Biomass from tall herb fringe, tall grass and low herb and grass communities is suitable to be incorporated into the anaerobic digestion supply chain; and in these communities it could be possible to predict methane yield per ha, especially in tall grass community, using vegetation traits (Ellenberg values and Grimes life strategy) and phosphorus content in the biomass. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Buffer strips; Methane yield; Nutrient composition; Productive plant traits; Species composition","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Cluster analysis; Methane; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Supply chains; Vegetation; Buffer strip; Methane Yield; Nutrient composition; Plant traits; Species composition; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057170956

In the developed world, the retail stage has the greatest potential for waste reduction as it balances demand with supply, stimulates demand (thus affecting waste at the consumer level) and sets standards to the supply and the products (thus affecting food loss upstream). To precisely direct managerial intervention towards products with high waste-mitigation potential, the waste impact needs to be quantified. Previous studies measuring waste have examined individual metrics exclusive of each other, which affects the ranking of products. The present study proposes a method for prioritising waste based on combined monetary and environmental indicators, and it demonstrates the applicability of the method through empirical data from Scandinavian retail stores. The contribution of the proposed metric is that it results in a unique score comprising economic and environmental impacts for every single product, thus directing the managerial intervention more precisely. In addition, it enables choosing a weight for the economic and the environmental indicators, thus adding to the previous literature that looks at the products either through an economic or environmental perspective, exclusive of each other. Applying the method confirmed the previous research at a product group level that bread, meat and fruits/vegetables are the highest wasters. In addition, for some products, such as meat and fruit, the dependency between economic and environmental impacts is weaker, whereas it is stronger for others (e.g. bread and biscuits), thereby necessitating a method to gauge waste in both dimensions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impact; Food waste; Managerial intervention; Monetary impact; Ranking method; Retail store","Economic and social effects; Fruits; Managers; Retail stores; Sales; Environmental indicators; Food waste; International policies; Managerial intervention; Monetary impact; Ranking methods; Social awareness; Waste reduction; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057162309

Meyers Vænge 15, Copenhagen, 2450, Denmark","The environmental impact of packaging has already been studied since the early development of the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and today an extensive amount of studies exists. LCAs inform policy makers and guide companies in developing more environmentally sustainable packaging. From both a policy and a business perspective it is also relevant to understand what citizens and consumers recognize as being an environmentally sustainable packaging. Does perceived environmental sustainability align with the results of LCAs? And if not, where do consumers go wrong? In this study, we investigate how well-educated young consumers living in Denmark understand the environmental sustainability of five different kinds of packaging for liquid food (milk, beer, soft drink, olive oil and skinned tomatoes) based on an on-line survey and qualitative interviews. The results are compared with a streamlined LCA we performed for packaging of beer and soft drinks, and they are validated by means of comparative LCAs of these five product categories published in scientific literature. The results of the consumer research show that consumers assess the environmental sustainability of the tested types of packaging primarily based on the material type and on what they can personally do at the disposal stage. The consumers covered in this study do, in general, not consider the impacts of production and of transport. Amongst the investigated packaging types, bio-based types and glass are perceived as the most environmentally sustainable ones, and plastic in general is perceived least favourable. Laminated cartons receive a mixed perception. LCA results show that plastic – and especially laminated cartons – can be environmentally preferable solutions, even though they may be difficult to recycle. Our streamlined LCA on beer and soft drink shows that there is a significant difference in environmental performance between one-way glass and refillable glass, but consumers seem not to be aware of this difference. Our findings show i) that there is a gap between Danish consumers' perception of environmental sustainability of packaging and LCA results, and ii) that consumers have limited knowledge of sustainability-related eco-labels. In order to close these gaps, actions are needed both from producers, retailers and policy makers. The final aim of such improvement efforts should be to give to the consumers the possibility to make choices based on better information. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beverage containers; Circular economy; Consumer research; Eco-labels; Qualitative interviews; Survey","Beer; Decision making; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Glass; Laminating; Life cycle; Olive oil; Packaging; Surveying; Surveys; Beverage containers; Circular economy; Consumer research; Ecolabels; Qualitative interviews; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056793286

The aim is to assess the advances in this field by addressing the questions: What factors impact knowledge transfer in interorganizational partnerships? How do these factors interact with each other? Design/methodology/approach: The study reports results of a literature review conducted in ten top journals between 2000 and 2017 in the fields of strategy and innovation studies. Findings: The review identifies three overarching themes, which were organized according to 14 research questions. The first theme discusses knowledge in itself and elaborates on aspects of its attributes. The second theme presents the factors that influence interorganizational knowledge transfer at the macroeconomic, interorganizational, organizational and individual levels. The third theme focuses on the consequences, namely, effectiveness and organizational performance. Practical implications: Partnership managers may improve and adjust contracts, structures, processes and routines, as well as build support mechanisms and incentives to guarantee effectiveness in knowledge transfer in partnerships. Originality/value: The study proposes a novel theoretical framework that links antecedents, process and outcomes of knowledge transfer in interorganizational partnerships, while also identifying aspects that are either less well researched or contested and thereby suggesting directions for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Alliances; Collaboration; Interorganizational Partnerships; Knowledge transfer; Network",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049688195

It is shown that these units—consisting of sub-units which are not further known by the evaluator—are likely to receive an unjustifiable harsh evaluation, here referred to as aggregation bias. To counter this bias, we present an approach which allows to calculate the potential sub-unit efficiency of a decision making unit by taking into account the possible impact of its sub-units’ aggregation without having disaggregated sub-unit data. Based on data envelopment analysis, the approach is operationalized in several ways. Finally, we apply our method to the benchmarking model actually used by the Brazilian Electricity Regulator to measure the cost efficiency of the Brazilian distribution system operators. For this case, our results reveal that the potential effect of the aggregation bias on the operators’ efficiency scores is enormous. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aggregation bias; Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; DEA; Potential sub-unit efficiency; Regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046034698

In hospital services, this is expressed in a multiplication of quality assurance programmes, which may be characterized as technologies of quality control. Organizational research shows that the impact of such technologies is profound and often problematic. Even if rooted in professional expertise, they tend to evoke resistance and evasion among professionals. Drawing on Crozier's classic analysis of bureaucratic malfunctions and recent theory of professional hybridity and co-optation, this article brings forth a new aspect of professionals' encounter with managerial forms of governance, as manifested in a case study from the Danish hospital services. Despite scepticism, professional groups with differing status and interests can reinforce a burdensome system of governance with even more standards and intensified measuring, as they seek to use the technologies of quality control to manage uncertainties and enhance their standing in relation to other groups. Hence, professionals can find themselves caught in what we call a vicious circle of quality control. This dynamic, we propose, is essentially of a professional nature; it is through their very efforts to promote their distinctive aspirations that professionals may end up fuelling excessive measurement and detailed controls, thereby making their own work more difficult. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

However, the 1985 resolution of the Danish Parliament excluded nuclear power from the national energy mix. In 2003, the Parliament passed a resolution on the decommissioning of the nuclear facility at Risø, including plans for establishing a permanent solution for radioactive waste management. To understand the ensuing socio-technical controversy, we employ the “hybrid forum” framework that emphasizes the entangled political-epistemological role of the municipalities and protest groups. They mobilized political resistance while also performing “research in the wild.” In 2016, the protest groups became part of an institutionalized “hybrid forum” where they could negotiate directly with experts and government representatives. We conclude that municipalities and protest groups were instrumental in changing the Danish position on radioactive waste management from final repository to long-term storage at Risø. © The Author(s) 2020.","Denmark; final repository; hybrid forum; radioactive waste management; research in the wild",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086667236

Lyngby, Denmark","An essential aspect that contributes to the resilience of radial electrical distribution systems (EDS) is the deployment of efficient and fast service restoration methods. In the presence of a permanent fault, the service restoration minimizes the amount of de-energized consumers by reducing the area that needs to be disconnected to isolate the faulty section of the network. To do so, the service restoration algorithm can make use of automated switching devices and dispatchable energy resources allocated throughout the network to transfer loads among feeders, considering the system's operational constraints. Depending on the size of the system and the complexity of the telecommunication infrastructure, the application of centralized restoration systems may neither be practical nor flexible. Thus, in this paper, a distributed service restoration method is proposed, using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. As such, the original service restoration model is distributed among the nodes and branches of the system that exchange limited information with neighboring nodes and branches. Radiality constraint is also distributed by the proposed ADMM algorithm. A 44-node test system was used to conduct case studies. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently solves the service restoration in active EDS without using a centralized Intelligence. © 2019 IEEE.","Alternating direction method of multipliers; electrical distribution systems; radiality constraint; service restoration","Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Restoration; Alternating direction method of multipliers; Dispatchable energies; Electrical distribution system; Fast service restoration; Operational constraints; radiality constraint; Service restoration; Telecommunication infrastructures; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071468499

The refugee crisis was managed by an emerging polycentric and intersectoral collective of organizations. In this paper, we investigate how leaders of these organizations made decisions in concert with each other and hence sustained the capacity to act as collective. We ask: what was the logic of decision-making that orchestrated collective action during the crisis? In answering this question, we make the following contribution: departing from March’s logics of consequences and appropriateness as well as Weick’s work on sensemaking during crisis, we introduce an alternative logic that informed decision-making in our study: the logic of tact. With this concept (a) we offer a better understanding of how managers may make decisions under the condition of bounded rationality and the simultaneous transgression of their institutional identity in situations of crisis; and (b) we show that in decision-making under extreme pressure cognition is neither ahead of action, nor is action ahead of cognition; rather, tact explicates the rapid switching between cognition and action, orchestrating decision-making through their interplay. © The Author(s) 2018.","capacity to act; collective action; crisis; decision-making; logic of appropriateness; logic of consequences; logic of tact; logic of tact; sensemaking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059671659

Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills are lifesaving skills, the gap between awareness and actual training remains significant. Advances in technology are shaping the future of education and innovative learning solutions are essential to facilitate effective and accessible training. This project objective is to develop a self-directed educational system for hands-on CPR training using virtual reality (VR) technology. Methods. HTC VIVE was the chosen VR engine, and Unity3D was the software used for development. CPR skills including chest compressions, rescue breathing, and automated external defibrillator (AED) are taught in VR through focused instructions, demonstrations, and simulated interactive scenarios with hands-on training sessions. A tracking system was designed using virtual planes and VIVE-Tracker for accurate measurements of chest compressions (rate, depth, and recoil), hands’ position and AED. A real mannequin was integrated in the VR space and overlaid with virtual 3D-human model for realistic haptic feedback and hands-on training. VIVE-controller was used for precise calibration between the mannequin location in real environment and the virtual human model in VR space. Results. The VR-CPR prototype was designed to be generic, approachable, and easy to follow. Realism and interaction were achieved through 3D virtual scenes simulating common sites at which cardiac arrest may occur. Variety in scenarios and gamification features like scoring and difficulty levels of training were made to enhance users’ engagement. The VR-mannequin hybrid system enabled quality training and immersive learning experience. Further, real-time feedback and scoring system are built for self-directed learning and optimal performance. Conclusions. The developed VR-hybrid product is a structured educational tool for hands-on CPR training and ongoing practice. This innovative technology provides self-directed learning with no restrictions of time, place, or personnel, which are the main challenges with current traditional courses. This product is a promising CPR training initiative in the evolution of digital education. © The Author(s) 2019.","CPR; education; haptic feedback; healthcare; simulation; technology; virtual reality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059630572

Early birds offer the same rewards as an alternative option, but are reduced in price. Although studies suggest that scarcity can influence backers’ decisions, research lacks knowledge of whether early bird options impact backers’ decision-making once these options are sold out but still visible to potential contributors. Drawing on the phantom effect theory, this multi-method study investigates (1) how phantom alternatives impact backers’ selections of available options, and (2) how the phantom effect interacts with different levels of discount and social proof. Our results from an online experiment with 512 participants and a longitudinal observational study based on 676 crowdfunding projects reveal that phantom options make backers choose the equivalent but undiscounted reward option more often. This effect is stronger with a moderate amount of discount for the early bird option rather than a high one. Moreover, social proof (i.e., number of backers who have chosen the early bird option) interacts with the discount amount in that higher levels of social proof weaken the relationship between the amount of discount and the phantom effect.

This study investigates the distribution of tree cover in the eastern part of China in 2010, and how it is related to climate, topography, and anthropogenic pressure. We use random forest modeling of remote sensing data for tree cover, together with data for topography, climate, and anthropogenic pressure. Our results show that 2,136,000 km 2 had tree cover ≥25% in the eastern part of China in 2010 and that the areas with high tree cover were mainly distributed in north-eastern, southern, and south-central China. The variable that best explains the distribution of tree cover is actual evapotranspiration followed by slope and population density. The association between slope and tree cover increases as population density rises, suggesting that the association may be influenced by anthropogenic land use intensity and that slopes act as refugees for forests. Our study emphasizes the need to pay attention to the association between slope and tree cover and especially to the anthropogenic factors that, entirely or to some extent, drive this association. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic pressure; China; Human impacts; MODIS; Topography; Tree cover 2010","anthropogenic effect; data set; MODIS; remote sensing; slope dynamics; topographic effect; vegetation cover; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059526211

With the increased capabilities of online digital platforms, managers need to deliver goods and services faster and respond rapidly to customers. It is therefore critical to ask what “real time” means to managers, what real-time management entails, and learn how enterprises capture business value through real-time management, especially when the ability to adjust and operate in real time must be ingrained in an organization’s culture, structures, and processes. This article shows that managers who use “real time” in different ways can articulate different facets of experience and practices, leading to the “Fast & Flow” framework.

A factor analysis of the personality traits of active entrepreneurs reveals nine entrepreneurial factor types, which are further subjected to psychological analysis. Based on leadership, innovation, social and efficiency skills, the psychological interpretation reveals three categories in entrepreneurship: the self-employed, the business owner and the entrepreneur. The categories exhibit inherent dissimilarities and similarities that clearly explain the discrepancies in entrepreneurs’ preferences on a profoundly personal level. The concept of entrepreneur, commonly used to refer to a variety of individuals, accurately describes only one category. Instead, the concepts of self-employed and business owner better explain the related activity and outcomes of the other two categories. Accordingly, the results suggest that the quality of support, expected outcomes and consequently socio-economic growth will improve with a thorough consideration by authorities of each individual’s personality or at least by consideration of which category best describes the target group of, for example, teaching and financial support. © The Author(s) 2018.","Business owner; entrepreneur; entrepreneurial types; factor analysis; personality traits; self-employed",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058975862

In both cases, recovery compensation exhibits diminishing returns on compensation size in terms of recovery satisfaction. However, at the group level, the rate at which the returns on compensation diminish is greater and satisfaction reaches a plateau at lower compensation levels than at the individual level. The salient social comparison made during a group service recovery (GSR), as evidenced by the mediating role of distributive justice, explains these effects. Finally, we note that at midrange compensation levels, GSR and individual service recovery did not lead to different levels of recovery satisfaction, suggesting a zone of tolerance or indifference at these levels.

Linkages between nodes are measured by the number of active research collaborations between biotech actors located in these regions. The degree of the interregional collaboration activity between regional nodes is modeled as a function of the regions’ research and economic capabilities, the geographical distance between regions, and a set of policy variables. The empirical results from count data regressions show that link formation is significantly related to both node properties and the relationship between nodes. While locational factors such as regional high-tech start-up rates, the endowment with MINT employees and the population density as a broad measure for agglomeration economies are positively correlated with the extent of interregional research collaboration, distance acts an impediment to interregional collaboration.

The illusion of their pervasive influence persists because it is built into the narratives we tell about events, in the form of unexamined assumptions about—inter alia—power, plans, and planners.

We subsequently introduce an important boundary condition, which reflects subsidiaries’ internal agency relations with subsidiary CEOs as second principals.

Although the related practices and principles are now widely reported, the theories and philosophical premises underlying lean production are not commonly known. This also applies to lean construction, which, although it originated as a set of countermeasures to specific problems in construction, has more recently evolved in alignment with lean production. For example, there is a stark but unexplained contradiction between lean and traditional construction management models regarding the importance of learning and improvement. In view of this, the aim here is to determine the epistemological orientation in these two models. It is found that two different starting points for epistemology, Platonism and Aristotelianism, have also played a major role in the formation of the fundamental ideas of engineering and management generally and in construction. An overly Platonic influence on engineering and management has created a number of problems. It is contended that one major explanation for the evident benefits of lean construction is related to its Aristotelian epistemology. © 2018 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",,"Philosophical aspects; Project management; Lean construction; Specific problems; Toyota Production System; Traditional constructions; Lean production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057447860

Efforts are made by governments and companies to reduce GHG emissions via policies and actions. In order to determine which actions to prioritize among many options, benefits of emission reductions are often monetized, to compare with the costs of action or with benefits that can be obtained from other actions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a commonly used tool to assess the amount of GHGs emitted over the life cycle of a service, policy or product system. However, the damage modelling of GHGs in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and its monetary values have not been separately evaluated. This hinders the application of LCA in relevant decision contexts. This study evaluates the cause-effect chains and associated monetary values of GHG in three LCIA methods LIME2, EPS2015 and ReCiPe2016. Among these three, EPS2015 covers most damage categories, including the ones on human health, ecosystem and social assets. ReCiPe2016 does not include social assets damages and LIME2 does not consider ecosystem damages in climate change impact. Human health damages are well estimated in all three methods, contributing to 70–97% of the GHG monetary values. The lack of data is a clear obstacle across methods. Further research is needed to develop comprehensive and robust modelling approach for ecosystem damages, which are not well covered in current LCIA methods. Moreover, due to the scope of environmental LCA, there is a lack of consideration on socio-economic consequences, which may not be negligible for climate change. The resulting monetary value of GHG, expressed in per tonne CO2-eq are 16, 160 and 140 US$2017 respectively in LIME2, EPS2015 and ReCiPe 2016. These monetary values are reasonable for use in decision contexts where LCA is applied.

However, pesticide fractions not reaching the intended target may have adverse effects on the environment and the field ecosystems. Modeling pesticide emissions and the link with characterizing associated impacts is currently one of the main challenges in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of agricultural systems. To address this challenge, this study takes advantage of the latest recommendations for pesticide emission inventory and impact assessment and frames a suitable interface for those LCA stages and the related mass distribution of pesticide avoiding a temporal overlapping. Here, freshwater ecotoxicity impacts of the production of feed crops (maize, grass, winter wheat, spring barley, rapeseed, and peas) in Denmark were evaluated during a 3-year period, testing the effects of inventory modeling and the recent updates of the characterization method (USEtox). Potential freshwater ecotoxicity impacts were calculated in two functional units reflecting crop impact profiles per ha and extent of cultivation, respectively. Ecotoxicity impacts decreased over the period, mainly because of the reduction of insecticides use (e.g., cypermethrin). Three different emission modeling scenarios were tested; they differ on the underlining assumptions and data requirements. The main aspects influencing impact results are the interface between inventory estimates and impact assessment, and the consideration of intermedia processes, such as crop growth development and pesticide application method. Impact scores for AS2 were higher than RS and AS1, but the differences in the crops ranking was less apparent. On the other hand, the influence on the estimation of impacts for individual AIs was considerable and statistical differences were found in the impact results modeled in scenarios RS and AS2. Thereby indicating the effect of inventory models on ecotoxicity impact assessment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Ecotoxicity characterization; Feed crops; Inventory modeling; Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Pesticide emission factors","Agriculture; Crops; Cultivation; Disease control; Life cycle; Pesticides; Water; Characterization methods; Ecotoxicity; Inventory modeling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Pesticide applications; Pesticide emission; Statistical differences; Chemical contamination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057176478

Yet, evidence of effects of interventions to enhance the social capital are lacking. The intervention mapping method has been described as a useful tool for developing workplace interventions but it is very resource consuming. We aimed to develop an adapted version of the intervention mapping method which is more practically feasible to apply. To get insight into strengths and weaknesses of the adapted method, we applied it and conducted interviews with staff at six companies. The interviews revealed that the action plans developed using the adapted intervention mapping method were generally perceived as relevant and that the action plans had a positive effect on the social capital. However, the implementation of the action plans had been a challenge. In conclusion, the adapted intervention mapping method appears to be suitable for developing interventions to enhance the social capital in the workplace. However, more attention to the implementation of the action plans needs to be incorporated into the method. Suggestions to enhance the implementation included the involvement of the management in the implementation and monitoring of the implementation of the action plans as well as integrating the action plans into existing procedures in the workplace. © 2018 The Authors","Bonding social capital; Bridging social capital; Employee wellbeing; Linking social capital; Occupational psychology; Organisational psychology; Participatory interventions","mapping; occupation; organizational framework; psychology; social capital; workplace; article; attention; employee; human; interview; monitoring; occupational psychology; social capital; staff; wellbeing; workplace; group process; industry; occupational health; procedures; program development; program evaluation; psychology; workplace; Group Processes; Humans; Industry; Occupational Health; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Social Capital; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056616689

First, in descriptive terms, we set out to explore the prevalence of spatially dispersed CHQs in a historical context. Second, we aim to shed additional light on the CHQ's spatial design by exploring internal antecedents and potential consequences. Building on arguments from information-processing theory, we propose that the strategic complexity facing the CHQ (affecting its information-processing demands) is associated with the likelihood of a spatially dispersed CHQ (affecting its information-processing capacity). In line with our dual purpose, we conduct a historical study drawing on survey and archival data covering 156 public firms domiciled in four countries (Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US) in the late 1990s. Our results provide empirical support for the hypothesized associations between strategic complexity and the CHQ's spatial design. Moreover, although we find no empirical support for the expected contingency effects, the results suggest that a spatially dispersed CHQ can have negative effects on CHQ and firm performance.

Intervention components may be implemented differently, knowledge about this can provide an understanding of which components are essential and therefore must be included. The aim of this study was to examine the implementation of one, two, or all three main intervention components at the individual level and to assess the association to current smoking among 13 year-olds in the X:IT study. Methods: Data stems from a cluster-randomized controlled trial in 94 Danish elementary schools (51 intervention; 43 control schools). Implementation was measured by aspects of adherence, dose, quality of delivery, and participant responsiveness based on questionnaire data from 4161 pupils at baseline (mean-age: 12.5 years) and 3764 pupils at first follow-up eight months later. Coordinator responses from 49 intervention schools were also included. Associations between individual level implementation of the three main components and pupil smoking were examined through a 3-level logistic regression model. Results: Although implementation fidelity for the three main intervention components was good, only one third (38.8%) of pupils in intervention schools were exposed to full implementation of the intervention. Among these pupils odds ratio for smoking was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.15 – 0.42). Conclusions: School-based programs can be very effective if carefully implemented. Future school-based smoking preventive initiatives should include multiple components, and seek to enhance implementation quality of all components. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adolescents; Implementation fidelity; Multi-component intervention; School-based prevention; Smoking prevention","adolescence; smoking; adolescent; adolescent smoking; article; controlled study; female; follow up; human; male; prevention; primary school; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; smoking prevention; child parent relation; Denmark; education; health promotion; organization and management; program evaluation; school health service; smoking ban; smoking prevention; Denmark; Adolescent; Denmark; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Parents; Program Evaluation; School Health Services; Smoke-Free Policy; Smoking Prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053804592

The paper shows that there is no single path of technology upgrading. Instead, we find several unique paths with different trade-offs between intensity, structural change and the nature of the global interaction. All BRICS economies display increased generation of frontier technological activities, while China and Russia have also increased the intensity of behind frontier technological activities. China has also diversified its technology knowledge base and entered into dynamic frontier areas. With increasing intensity of frontier technology activities of the BRICS, the relative, but not absolute, the importance of foreign actors and international collaboration has declined. However, BRICS economies seem to lack the organisational and complementary capabilities to match the extent of technology sourcing from abroad, observed in high-income countries.

This is surprising, as the conjecture that lead user ideas are more likely to be implemented and diffused than non-lead user ideas is a key tenet of lead user research. To test this conjecture we draw on a sample of 87 internal process users in a large electronics firm who submitted ideas to an idea management system. 452 ideas were suggested, of which 148 were implemented and 33 further diffused on the shopfloor. We find that higher lead userness is positively and significantly associated with the likelihood of suggested ideas being implemented and diffused. This effect is substantial: Ideas coming from lead users were more than two times more likely to be implemented and more than three times more likely to be diffused than ideas coming from non-lead users. We conclude that lead user ideas are more likely than non-lead user ideas to be implemented and diffused throughout a social system, which arguably constitutes the ultimate success of any idea.

The findings illuminate trends and gaps in the literature. Specifically, this study identifies a growing trend of applying interviews as a method of data collection, which increases the possibility of representing individual stakeholders. Predominantly, administrators’ and doctors’ viewpoints are presented, whereas a lack of perspectives among nurses, patients, and politicians raises opportunities for future research. Additionally, there has been an increase in the number of countries represented in studies. Whereas Scandinavian countries are well represented in this literature review, studies of non-English-speaking countries are still significantly lacking. The accounting topic in focus has seen a natural development with New Public Management (NPM) reform developments. A majority of costing and budgeting studies in the 1980s and 1990s have gradually changed to a performance measure focus and different atypical areas, signaling increased nuances in the role of accounting in the health care sector. Thus, although the majority of the existing accounting literature has focused on NPM market reforms, NPM health care reform is far from exhausted, and ample opportunities exist for future research in health care accounting. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","accounting; health care reform; literature review; New Public Management",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053066375

The attributes are used as analytical devices for gathering extensive empirical evidence on the actual practices of EU28 member states. The findings show that few countries have developed a type of innovation policy evaluation that is system oriented. The advent of a system approach to innovation policy evaluation offers the opportunity of comprehensive, contextualized and evidence-based innovation policy-making.

Traditional landline phones and mobile phones up to 3G technology are known to trigger the so-called telephone voice. The phonetic changes induced by the telephone voice (louder speech at a higher pitch level) are suitable for undermining the perceived competence, trustworthiness and charisma of a speaker and can, thus, negatively influence business actions over the mobile phone. In a speech production experiment with 20 speakers and a subsequent acoustic speech-signal analysis of almost 15 000 utterances, we tested in comparison to a baseline face-to-face dialog condition, whether the telephone voice still exists in a technological setting of VoLTE 4G mobile-phone communication. In fact, we found that the typical characteristics of the telephone voice persist even under the currently best technological 4G standards and under silent communication conditions. Moreover, we identified further acoustic-phonetic parameters of the telephone voice, some of which (like a more monotonous intonation) further compound the problem of business communication over the mobile phone. In combination, the extended parametric picture and the persistent occurrence of the telephone voice even under quiet 4G conditions suggest that a speech-in-noise-like (i.e. Lombard) adaption is not the only and perhaps not even the primary cause behind the telephone voice. Based on this, we propose a number of innovations and R&D activities for making mobile-phone technology more suitable for business communication. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","business communication; Lombard speech; mobile phone innovation; phonetics; technology assessment; Telecommunications technology; telephone voice; vocal effort",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052680176

This has been down-played in studies engaging with the ‘practice turn’, especially within the sociology of sustainable consumption. Using latent class analysis, four distinct latent subgroups with similar patterns of material consumption are identified and analysed. On the basis of the possession of appliances, these groups are characterised and labelled unlimited, outdated, limited and updated. After assigning the households to the latent group to which they have the highest probability of belonging, the social character of these groups is examined using logit models, thus making explanations of differences in material consumption practices possible. As identified in other domains of consumption, this study found that patterns of material consumption are socially structured. Researchers within the sociology of sustainable consumption have been particularly interested in studying the role of material arrangements and infrastructures in reproducing shared understandings and common procedures. This article argues that, in order to fully understand the dynamic mechanisms of consumption patterns and the possibilities for sustainable development, the field should equally engage with shared understandings generated and reproduced by social groups. © The Author(s) 2016.","household appliances; latent class analysis; material consumption; Practice; social differentiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050310385

Due to their limited resources and liability of newness, these startups must rely on outside partners for resources and legitimacy to succeed and indeed to survive. Yet, few studies have specifically examined, or provided guidance on, how startups can increase supplier involvement in their innovation projects. Drawing from Transactional Cost Economics and supplier involvement literature, this study develops a contingency model, in which supplier's equity share and supplier's trust moderate the relationship of supplier's involvement in a startup's innovation with supplier's specific investment and startup's effort in qualification of supplier's ability. We empirically test the model using data collected from 166 innovation projects of 166 startups. Our results show that supplier involvement is pivotal to startup's product innovation performance, which is consistent with prior literature on supplier involvement. Interestingly, our results further reveal that supplier's specific investment and startup's effort in qualification of supplier's ability lead to higher levels of supplier involvement only when supplier's equity share and supplier's trust are sufficiently high. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","entrepreneurial innovation; equity share; Supplier involvement; supplier trust; transactional cost economics",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047805923

This article traces the different ways in which organizational scholars have engaged with Foucault’s writings over the past thirty years or so. We identify four overlapping waves of influence. Drawing on Foucault’s Discipline and Punish, the first wave focused on the impact of discipline, and techniques of surveillance and subjugation, on organizational practices and power relations. Part of a much wider ‘linguistic’ turn in the second half of the twentieth century, the second wave led to a focus on discourses as intermediaries that condition ways of viewing and acting. This wave drew mainly on Foucault’s early writings on language and discourse. The third wave was inspired by Foucault’s seminal lectures on governmentality towards the end of the 1970s. Here, an important body of international research investigating governmental technologies operating on subjects as free persons in sites such as education, accounting, medicine and psychiatry emerged. The fourth and last wave arose out of a critical engagement with earlier Foucauldian organizational scholarship and sought to develop a more positive conception of subjectivity. This wave draws in particular on Foucault’s work on asceticism and techniques of the self towards the end of his life. Drawing on Deleuze and Butler, the article conceives the Foucault effect in organization studies as an immanent cause and a performative effect. We argue for the need to move beyond the tired dichotomies between discipline and autonomy, compliance and resistance, power and freedom that, at least to some extent, still hamper organization studies. We seek to overcome such dichotomies by further pursuing newly emerging lines of Foucauldian research that investigate processes of organizing, calculating and economizing characterized by a differential structuring of freedom, performative and indirect agency. © The Author(s) 2017.","critique; discipline; discourse; ethics; Foucault; governmentality; performativity; power; subjectivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041910375

To provide a more structured conceptualization of organizational transparency, this article unpacks the assumptions that shape the extant literature, with a focus on three dimensions: conceptualizations, conditions, and consequences. The contribution of the study is twofold: (a) On a conceptual level, we provide a framework that articulates two paradigmatic positions underpinning discussions of transparency, verifiability approaches and performativity approaches; (b) on an analytical level, we suggest a novel future research agenda for studying organizational transparency that pays attention to its dynamics, paradoxes, and performative characteristics. © The Author(s) 2016.","corporate governance; corporate transparency; organizational theory; performativity; theory building",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035111780

Design/methodology/approach: The study is a qualitative study based on semi-structured interviews at three Danish hospitals. Findings: The study found that the leadership set-up did not have any clear influence on interdisciplinary cooperation, as all wards had a high degree of interdisciplinary cooperation independent of which leadership set-up they had. Instead, the authors found a relation between leadership set-up and leader legitimacy. In cases where staff only referred to a leader from their own profession, that leader had legitimacy within the staff group. When there were two leaders from different professions, they only had legitimacy within the staff group from their own profession. Furthermore, clinical specialty also could influence legitimacy. Originality/value: The study shows that leadership set-up is not the predominant factor that creates interdisciplinary cooperation; but rather, leader legitimacy also should be considered. Additionally, the study shows that leader legitimacy can be difficult to establish and that it cannot be taken for granted. This is something chief executive officers should bear in mind when they plan and implement new leadership structures. Therefore, it would also be useful to look more closely at how to achieve legitimacy in cases where the leader is from a different profession to the staff. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Health care; Interdisciplinary cooperation; Leader set-up; Leadership; Leadership in health care; Legitimacy","article; human; human experiment; leadership; occupation; qualitative research; semi structured interview; staff; thinking; adult; clinical trial; cooperation; Denmark; female; hospital personnel; interview; male; middle aged; multicenter study; psychology; public relations; Adult; Cooperative Behavior; Denmark; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Interviews as Topic; Leadership; Male; Middle Aged; Personnel, Hospital; Qualitative Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045203204

Nevertheless, studies that relate business ethics to corporate brands are either theoretical or have predominantly been developed empirically in goods contexts. This is surprising, because corporate brands are more relevant in services settings, given the nature of services (i.e., intangible, heterogeneous, inseparable and perishable), and the fact that services settings comprise a greater number of customer–brand interactions and touch points than goods contexts. Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to empirically examine the effects of customer perceived ethicality of corporate brands that operate in the services sector. Based on data collected for eight service categories using a panel of 2179 customers, the hypothesized structural model is tested using path analysis. The generalizability theory is applied to test for measurement equivalence between these categories. The results of the hypothesized model show that, in addition to a direct impact, customer perceived ethicality has a positive and indirect impact on brand equity, through the mediators of recognition benefits and brand image. Moreover, brand heritage negatively influences the impact of customer perceived ethicality on brand image. The main implication is that managers need to be aware of the need to reinforce brand image and recognition benefits, as this can facilitate the translation of customer perceived ethicality into brand equity. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Brand equity; Brand image; Common method variance; Corporate services brand; Customer perceived ethicality; Generalizability theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011805279

The SECI model was used to identify the different stages involved in the creation and sharing of knowledge among the knowledge actors and the MRT was also employed to assess how the richness of the web 2.0 technologies could affect the interaction among the knowledge actors through the various SECI processes involved in the knowledge sharing process. The study proposes that there exists a positive correlation between the tacitness of knowledge and the richness of media used for sharing knowledge, which can be used as the basis for selecting the appropriate social media technologies for the different modes of the SECI processes for effective knowledge sharing among knowledge actors. © 2018 IEEE.","Agriculture; Knowledge Sharing; Media Richness; Social websites; Web 2.0","Agriculture; Information systems; Information use; Knowledge management; Metals; Social networking (online); Interactive communications; Knowledge-sharing; Media richness; Media richness theory; Positive correlations; Sharing knowledge; Web 2.0; Web 2.0 Technologies; Knowledge acquisition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062711324

The research is made as a part of the WP3 of an EU funded Interreg project DIGINNO. Empirical data for the qualitative study was elicited from the Danish/German Cross-Border service, The Region Sonderjylland- Schleswig and the Danish/Swedish cross border service, Oresunddirekt. The findings of the first study points to language, online identification/authentication, document recognition and national regulations as the major barriers. The second study points to the lack of institutional legitimacy for the internationalization of EU G2B services as a barrier to G2B cross border service delivery between the member states.

By deploying these sensors in body area networks new unique ambient assisted living services can be created. A key service in this area is a fall-detector for the elderly, which is able to sense falls and transmit alarms wirelessly. However, a major challenge in relation to this service is the dependency of batteries which limits the data-collecting capabilities, the data-processing capabilities, and the wireless communication capabilities. In addition, the process of changing batteries is costly, risky and impractical. In this paper the challenges with the batteries are overcome by deploying an energy harvesting system. The energy is harvested from the thermal flux emitted from human skins to its surroundings. A considerable part of this energy is used to overcome the challenges in transmitting the fall-detector data wirelessly. From simulations it has been found that a small form factor fall-detector sensor is able to harvest enough energy to transmit an alarm over the needed distance. © 2018 IEEE.","Body area networks; Fall-detectors; Thermal energy harvesting; Wireless sensor communication","Assisted living; Body sensor networks; Data handling; Electric batteries; Thermal energy; Wearable sensors; Ambient assisted living; Body Area Network; Energy harvesting systems; Fall detectors; Processing capability; Small form factors; Wireless communication capabilities; Wireless sensor communication; Energy harvesting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062688088

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how employees perceive and evaluate a sponsorship that is designed with the purpose of improving customer services and explore how the company may benefit from the sponsorship. Design/methodology/approach: The study is anchored in critical realism and based on a single case study using multiple methods. The authors survey the impact of the sponsorship on employees’ (n=653) perceptions of their ability to communicate with customers, to perform their personal best, to engage in teamwork, as well as employee retention. The authors use individual and group interviews to qualify the analysis and the access to company data on customer satisfaction rates to provide an indication of the effect of the sponsorship. Findings: Results indicate that close to half the employees respond that the campaign positively impacted their ability to communicate, improve personal performance and to engage in teamwork. The analysis also reveals that the commitment of the direct leader has an impact on employees’ interest and commitment to the campaign. Data on customer satisfaction show that reducing the number of dissatisfied customers and increasing the number of customers willing to recommend the company to others has been accomplished, thus indicating that the sponsorship has had a positive impact on company performance. Originality/value: By combining sponsorship research with insights from the HRM literature, the study provides empirically based knowledge to the hitherto limited research on the internal audience of sponsorships. The study provides a plausible indication of a positive relation between a sponsorship design and company performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical realism; Human resource management; Internal audience; Middle managers; Olympic rowing; Service-center employees",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049521363

Most European cities have experienced problems in certain neighbourhoods that are termed deprived or excluded. Traditionally these were found in the oldest urban areas with lowest quality housing, but since the 1980s, such areas have emerged in housing estates built around the cities' edges. These neighbourhoods are marked by visible physical and social problems that disfigure the otherwise pleasant urban landscape, and can be seen as urban sores. This engaging and thought-provoking book provides a deeper understanding of why urban decay and deprived neighbourhoods appear in certain parts of cities, as well as how they affect residents and cities in general. Drawing on in-depth empirical research from Denmark, it compares this with other studies from Europe and the United States. The author combines theories and methodologies from the fields of geography (on segregation), economics (on processes of urban decay) and social research (on social exclusion and deprived neighbourhoods) to provide original, illuminating and invaluable insights. © Hans Skifter Andersen, 2003.

Findings: The authors find that despite differential size and incongruent organizational cultures, top managers were still initially able to facilitate collaboration through various knowledge-sharing initiatives, but that these efforts were subsequently undermined by middle managers (due to misaligned incentives), which prevented both parties from reaping the gains of piggybacking on global markets. Research limitations/implications: The findings have a number of implications for academics and practitioners alike. Theoretical implications include treating piggybacking as a special case of indirect exporting with particular challenges for knowledge exchange and trust building. Practical implications: The authors offer managerial implications for reconciling divergent organizational cultures, partner selection and incentive alignment.

Specifically, ISO 15118 enables V2G as it oversees the communication between electric vehicles (EVs) and electric vehicle service equipment. It allows for bidirectional electricity flows and thereby offers electricity grids the use of EV batteries for grid services like frequency control and demand side management. We observe that highly technical and invisible standards like these are understudied in the energy literature and commonly misinterpreted as purely technical in scope. Hence in our contribution we offer such a study and use ISO 15118 to show how even in the most technical and invisible of cases, politics is still at work. We argue that standards, through a process of coproduction, are of vital importance for the governance of energy systems and play a major role in energy transitions through the various nontechnical assumptions scripted into them. Drawing from a synthesis of the literature on standardization, innovation studies, and science and technology studies, we thus analyse the implementation of ISO 15118 in the United States, China, Denmark and the Netherlands. We find a detailed technical standard that is implemented with differing degrees and in different sociotechnical and institutional contexts. We conclude by suggesting what this selectivity, compliance and fragmentation means for electric mobility and energy policymaking more generally. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Automotive manufacturing; Coproduction; Electric vehicles; ISO 15118; Transnational governance; Vehicle-to-grid integration","Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Automotive manufacturing; Co-production; Grid integration; ISO 15118; Transnational governance; Vehicle-to-grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056178734

However, concrete results – significant emissions reductions, expected from cities committed to mitigating climate change, are currently conspicuously absent. While there are several good practice guides available for large/mega cities there are little available for small and medium-sized ones (SMCs). In this paper the main research questions are, “When exploring local climate mitigation action among multiple small- and medium-sized cities, what actions are perceived as good practices?” and “Are there any demonstrable effects linking them to achieving climate mitigation targets, and is this monitored?” A multiple case study research approach, using quali-quantitative mixed methods with multiple types of data sources, was used to analyze thirteen SMCs in the Netherlands. Results revealed twenty six good practices, with the majority exhibiting the characteristics of governing by enabling. However, no evidence was found that these good practices had been embedded in indicators or protocols, nor that they led to actual GHG emission reduction. In addition, action plans were found to be incomplete, in particular regarding implementation, and municipalities were found to work in isolation, with little inter-municipal collaboration. Moreover, whereas a monitor of local climate mitigation performance exists – using output and outcome indicators - it was found to be hardly known nor used among local policy makers. The results reveal a need to learn from good practices, to develop indicators that mirror these practices, and integrate them into local climate mitigation performance measurement tools. Currently, this is not the case, making it difficult to monitor local climate mitigation performance and progress vis-à-vis commitments made regarding the Paris Agreement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate action; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Good practice; Governing by enabling; Local government","Carbon; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Climate action; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Good practices; Governing by enabling; Local government; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055547366

The second study compared the influences of the guided discovery instruction approach and traditional lecture-based instruction on students' understanding of environmental sustainability concepts. Results show the guided discovery instruction approach facilitated a better understanding of interactions among design parameters and the resulting environmental impact. We also found that students in the guided discovery instruction group gave more prominence to modifying design parameters specific to mechanical engineering concepts taught in the course.

Yet, despite the advantages of its increased connectivity and systems integration with suppliers and customers, this also opens the door to new risks from and to supply chain partners. Literature in this nascent research area is limited, with few frameworks available to complement traditional risk management methods. This paper shows the current results of a literature review on the field of supply chain cyber risk management (SCCRM), with the aim of gathering and structuring its extant literature and proposing a taxonomy that will give a better overview of the approaches found in the scientific literature. This taxonomy is then used to propose a novel SCCRM framework. Finally, a novel Impact-Wave analogy is presented to provide a graphical understanding of the application of this framework. © 2018 IEEE.","Cyber Risks; Resilience; Risk Management; Supply Chain","Supply chain management; Supply chains; Taxonomies; Cyberspaces; Impact waves; Literature reviews; Management method; Resilience; Scientific literature; Supply chain partners; Systems integration; Risk management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061826227

In multi-project environments, one particular problem is to quantify the effects of changing the number of projects that run concurrently. In this paper, a closed queueing network model of the flow of projects in a product development system is presented. The model is evaluated using discrete-event simulation. Using a relation between a project's monetary value and the time it spends in the system, an optimal number of concurrent projects is determined. Application of the model and results are shown for a case study of a Danish biotechnology company. Results show, that the value generated by the system can be increased by 17.5 percent by adjusting the total number of concurrent projects and by terminating low-value projects midway. Though the model is tailored to a specific system, it contains many features relevant for new product development systems in general. © 2018 IEEE.","Discrete-event simulation; Multi-project environment; New Product Development; Project Portfolio Management; Queueing network; Time-to-market","Distributed computer systems; Financial data processing; Investments; Product development; Project management; Queueing networks; Queueing theory; Biotechnology companies; Multi-project environment; New product development; New product development process; Product development projects; Product development system; Project portfolio management; Time to market; Discrete event simulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061823740

While there is extensive literature on the benefits of utilizing PCS, the cost of developing and maintaining PCS has not been explored to the same extent. This makes it difficult to put the benefits into perspective. Having a more accurate method of quantifying the cost of both developing and maintaining PCS, gives a value not only to researchers but also to practitioners when making business cases and improving resource planning in PCS projects. This article shows how historical data can be used to estimate the workload for developing and maintaining new PCS by taking into consideration both cognitive complexity and integrated IT systems.

The objective is to minimize inventory holding cost for the safety stock by determining the reorder point subject to a fill-rate constraint. Several approximations have been suggested for this model. Many of them assume that demand during the lead time follows a normal distribution. In this paper, model approximations assuming normal distributions are contrasted with gamma distributed lead-time demand. It is confirmed numerically, that the simplest approximation is quite accurate under some fairly restrictive conditions. However, it is found that considerable errors can be expected when demand uncertainty is increased, especially when the gamma distribution is applied. Fortunately, the more precise model specification with only marginally increased complexity works quite well, also for the gamma distribution. © 2018 IEEE.","Backordering; continuous review; fill rate; gamma distribution; normal distribution; safety stock; stochastic demand","Grain size and shape; Normal distribution; Safety engineering; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic systems; Backordering; Continuous review; Fill rate; Gamma distribution; Safety stock; Stochastic demand; Inventory control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061776354

Design/methodology/approach: Using a relational view of the firm, the authors propose that there are three main business dimensions that product companies have to manage in servitization and that the support of service suppliers can moderate the effects of these dimensions on the benefits obtained from the product–service system (PSS) delivered. To test these hypotheses, the authors perform a cross-sectional quantitative survey in 104 Brazilian and Italian product companies. Findings: The findings show that the three business dimensions are important for servitization while there is a trade-off decision regarding service suppliers’ support since suppliers act differently depending on the PSS orientation (product- or service-oriented). Research limitations/implications: The work is limited to the analysis of what should change in a company during servitization and the impact of supplier’s support. Further research is needed to complement this study by analyzing the process and context of the organizational change. Practical implications: The research contributes an understanding about how the benefits practitioners can obtain from servitization are strongly influenced by the support of service suppliers and how this influence depends on the PSS orientation of the product company.

We contribute to filling this gap by developing hypotheses claiming that frontline employees are more likely to accept and take causal responsibility of performance information when their organization is doing well on the performance indicators. Using a survey experiment including 1,988 public high-school teachers from 121 organizations, we offer evidence to support our hypotheses.

Results showed that the Academy Directors preferred to recruit their respective club’s current and former athletes as a means to govern their academy’s “club culture”.

On the Bitcoin Blockchain, an owning entity’s real-world identity is hidden behind a pseudonym, a so-called address. Therefore, Bitcoin is widely assumed to provide a high degree of anonymity, which is a driver for its frequent use for illicit activities. This paper presents a novel approach for de-anonymizing the Bitcoin Blockchain by using Supervised Machine Learning to predict the type of yet-unidentified entities. We utilized a sample of 957 entities (with ≈385 million transactions), whose identity and type had been revealed, as training set data and built classifiers differentiating among 12 categories. Our main finding is that we can indeed predict the type of a yet-unidentified entity. Using the Gradient Boosting algorithm with default parameters, we achieve a mean cross-validation accuracy of 80.42% and F1-score of ≈79.64%. We show two examples, one where we predict on a set of 22 clusters that are suspected to be related to cybercriminal activities, and another where we classify 153,293 clusters to provide an estimation of the activity on the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The study develops an original business care model that captures the dynamic interrelationships between care, responsibility and trust in corporate philanthropy. The model provides a novel perspective on how responsible business practices are formed across distance by shedding light on the different layers of responsibility and trust that characterize business–stakeholder relationships. The model is evaluated using the example of tour operators’ engagement in the Education for All project in Morocco. Findings show that tour operators’ commitment to caring at a distance becomes part of shared, displaced and performed articulations of responsibility. While performed responsibility acknowledges the embodiment of care, displaced responsibility shifts the responsibility to select, perform and/or oversee acts of care to stakeholders in destinations. Shared responsibility requires attention to the ways in which meanings and practices of care are co-constructed in corporate philanthropy with trust functioning as a central driver of these processes. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Business–stakeholder relations; corporate philanthropy; ethic of care; responsibility; tour operators; trust","business; ecotourism; ethics; stakeholder; tourist destination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060021656

In the follow-up period, individuals who were exposed to physical workplace violence had a higher number of visits to the general practitioner, had more often received outpatient treatment, and had more often been admitted to hospital than their non-exposed counterparts. Moreover, exposed individuals had higher odds of using antidepressants in the last three follow-up years than did non-exposed individuals.

Instead of treating silent responses as negative or pedagogical failure, I approach silence from an eclectic perspective informed by linguistic philosophy, social anthropology and cultural psychology and present an analysis of dialogic silence in relation to the nearly 500-year-old ritual practice of Chado, commonly known as the Japanese tea ceremony. I engage with key concepts of dialogue and silence in order to draw parallels between museums and heritage sites on one hand, and the practice of Chado, performed in the tearoom, on the other. I suggest how the performance of ritual in the Chado tearoom takes place in a heterotopic and heterochronic space of dialogue and of contemplation in silence, where people set aside the concerns of everyday life in a suspended time away from an otherwise unpredictable and violence-prone world. I then argue that heritage sites and museums can be seen as spaces of contemplation akin to the space of the tea ceremony, a comparison which offers an alternative perspective on the crisis of representation, the limitations of language and the problem of visitor fatigue. © 2018, © 2018 Kyoko Murakami.

Yet, individuals are central agents in starting and developing new businesses. Inspired by cultural and institutional theory, this study examines the cognitive coupling and symbolic management of entrepreneurial intentions of individuals as a consequence of the cultural legitimacy of entrepreneurship in society. The research design first replicates the well-established positive relationship between high self-efficacy and high entrepreneurial intentions in a heterogenous sample and then demonstrates the interaction effects with cultural legitimacy and domain independent subgroups, gender and work status. Using random sample survey data from 68 countries findings show that men and the employed are more likely to loosely couple and symbolically manage entrepreneurial intentions to found a new business than women and the unemployed.

However, this situation is not often met in practice, since data may be subject to uncertainty and it may change over time. In this paper, we introduce a general rescheduling framework to address such dynamic scheduling problems. The framework consists mainly of a controller that makes use of a solver. The solver can assume deterministic and static data, whereas the controller deals with the uncertain and dynamic aspects of the problem and it is in charge of triggering the solver when needed and when possible. Extensive tests are carried out for the job shop problem, and we demonstrate that the framework can be used to ascertain the benefit of using rescheduling over static methods, decide between rescheduling policies, and finally we show that it can be applied in real-life applications due to a low time overhead. The framework is general enough to be applied to any scheduling environment where a fast enough deterministic solver exists. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","dynamic scheduling; rescheduling framework; scheduling; simulation; simulation optimisation","Job shop scheduling; Optimization; Dynamic re-scheduling; Dynamic scheduling; Dynamic scheduling problems; Real-life applications; rescheduling framework; Scheduling problem; simulation; Simulation optimisation; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045459929

This study investigates how logistics processes in a hospital can be benchmarked to improve process performance. A comparative case study of the bed logistics process and the pharmaceutical distribution process was conducted at a Danish and a US hospital. The case study results identified decision criteria for designing efficient and effective healthcare logistics processes. The most important decision criteria were related to quality, security of supply and employee engagement. Based on these decision criteria, performance indicators were developed to enable benchmarking of logistics processes in healthcare.

A series of experiments examine how the nature of the selection process and the level of selection pressure influence the population-wide level of fitness and productivity over time. The results show that the distinction between subset selection from successor selection has important consequences. Furthermore, the results reveal that it is crucial to consider how selection operates on actual phenotypic properties while identifying the underlying genotypic properties that are transmitted in processes of organizational replication.

The analysis in the chapter shows how the idea of big data is institutionalized within the field of education both globally and in the public education sector in Denmark. The OECD is a key actor in developing the idea of big data in education, while the Ministry of Education in Denmark absorbs the idea of big data in a pragmatic way by adopting governance-by-data. However, the two cases show that school leaders in Denmark manually try to ‘dig’ into or ‘meld’ the available data sets at a school level. The chapter concludes that there is a discrepancy between the high level of expectation of big data at transnational and national levels and how school leaders use data at school level.

We do so by zooming in on four different empirical sites: diplomacy, mining, tourism and the cultural industries. By taking a closer look at who gets to brand Greenland and in which configurations, we dig into issues of agency and legitimacy. While the first two sites display strong top-down and foreign agential characteristics, the next two sites are characterized by more local control of brand elements and narratives. In the tourism sector recent branding attempts have sought to attract a global audience beyond the usual Danish tourists. Using recent Visit Greenland activities, such as the “Pioneering Nation” campaign, we extrapolate various, partially contradictory, identity positions in this field. Finally, looking at the cultural industries of fashion and food, we argue that Greenland – largely as a result of decentralized, commercial decisions – is supplementing its “indigenous” brand, highlighting traditional handicraft and food production with a post-modern re-circulation of culinary and artisanal products as national symbols. © Cecilia Cassinger, Andrea Lucarelli and Szilvia Gyimóthy 2019.

We develop a theoretical framework to explain the role of capital inflows in creating economic booms in a small open economy with sovereign currency. We demonstrate the destabilizing effects of capital inflows on the economy. We conclude that large speculative inflows generate debt-led booms, which are not sustainable in the long run. The episode of boom is followed by a bust, which is usually stronger in magnitude than the preceding boom. In particular, sovereign regimes are easily destabilized due to currency risk premiums and large trade balance effects.

Amagerbro and Ørestad, for example, experience large increases in mean incomes. Much of the change in social composition of the station catchments is driven by differences between the stayers, in-movers and out-movers relative to the conditions before the Metro investment. Impacts of the Metro hence reflect a combination of the Metro investment, the local context, provision of urban amenities, type of housing provision and supporting urban policies. © Robin Hickman, Beatriz Mella Lira, Moshe Givoni and Karst Geurs 2019.

Subsequently, theory and methodology need to be tailor-made to the problem under investigation. Students making problem-based economically oriented projects need to construct their own theoretical framework, often by combining different economic paradigms, linking to other social sciences and consulting previous, often interdisciplinary, research concerned with the problem at hand. These requirements constitute a challenge for mainstream economics, where theories are built on assumptions that are often very remote from real-life economics. Real-world economics, like Post-Keynesian economics, is far better suited to problem-based work, because they employ open-system analysis, which can be supplemented from other schools of thought and social sciences. Often problem-based learning-students deal with problems which require them to relate to previous studies of the problem at hand as well as mainstream and heterodox economic theory. This complexity makes students dependent on the advice and guidance of their supervisor, which needs to be open-minded, pluralistic and familiar with different economic paradigms. © Jesper Jespersen and Finn Olesen 2019.

Most countries were hit hard by the international crisis. The US, the EU and other countries have experienced low GDP growth rates and high levels of unemployment for a number of years. In the EU, and especially within the Eurozone, most member states have had to cope with the mainstream macroeconomic policy strategy of austerity (with Greece as the most significant recession case of the EU). As such, the neoclassical macroeconomics that became so dominant during the 1990s, and is still today by many seen as the only way to do macroeconomics, ruled the process of giving advice on economic policies to overcome the crisis. By using general equilibrium theory and models as the dominant analytical device, the focus point was at de-regulation, privatization and a balanced public sector budget to secure private sector optimization. No wonder that the vision of the beneficial welfare state and the egalitarian society was set on hold and in many cases rolled back on the political agenda. However, as we know as a fact today, prosperity did not come back to the many only to the few, already well off, in the US, in the EU and many other places. This misunderstood macroeconomics has taken a heavy political toll, because ‘[there is a] lack of correspondence between the results of their [the professional economists’] theory and the fact of observation; - a discrepancy which the ordinary man has not failed to observe’ (Keynes, 1936, p. 33). The Great Recession, initiated 10 years ago, began as an international financial crisis. It came as a surprise to mainstream macroeconomists. Accordingly, the policy recommendations were inconsistent and have been followed by stagnation, particularly of European economies, for a number of years. Consequently, many macroeconomic scholars have cast a critical eye on the content of the previously dominant new Macroeconomic Moderation (Bernanke, 2012) and the related Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. © Jesper Jespersen and Finn Olesen 2019.

This bioprocess occurs in the absence of oxygen and light. The ability to synthesize hydrogen, by dark fermentation, has raised its scientific attention. Hydrogen is a nonpolluting energy carrier molecule. However, for energy generation, there are a variety of other sustainable, and less expensive, alternatives to biohydrogen energy, e.g., solar, wind, tide, hydroelectric, biomass incineration, or nuclear fission. Nevertheless, dark fermentation appears as an important sustainable process in another area: the synthesis of valuable chemicals, i.e., an alternative to petrochemical refinery. Currently, acetic acid, butyric acid, and hydrogen are mostly produced by petrochemical reforming, and they serve as precursors of ubiquitous petrochemical-derived products. Hence, the future of dark fermentation relies as a core bioprocess in the biorefinery concept. The present article aims to present and discuss the current and future status of dark fermentation in the biorefinery concept. The first half of the article presents the metabolic pathways, product yields and its technological importance, microorganisms responsible for mixed dark fermentation, and operational parameters, e.g., substrates, pH, temperature, and headspace composition, which affect dark fermentation. The minimal selling price of dark fermentation products is also presented in this section. The second half discusses the perspectives and future of dark fermentation as a core bioprocess. The relationship of dark fermentation with other (bio)processes, e.g., liquid fuels and fine chemicals, algae cultivation, biomethane-biohythane-biosyngas production, and syngas fermentation, is then explored. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Acidogenesis; Biohydrogen; Bioprocesses; Biorefinery; Dark fermentation; Economics; Revenues",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134997005

The framework considers that, akin to the current petrochemical industry, the biomass-based industry should be designed as distributed multi-actor processes. The chapter starts by commenting on the current structure of the petrochemical industry and motivating the need for a distributed biomass-based industry.

Obstacles for its implementation are the need of pH control and a broad fermentation product spectrum leading to increased product separation costs. To overcome these obstacles, the selective production of lactic acid (LA) from model food waste by uncontrolled pH fermentation was tested using different reactor configurations. Batch experiments, semi-continuously fed reactors and a percolation system reached LA concentrations of 32, 16, and 15 gCODLA/L, respectively, with selectivities of 93%, 84%, and 75% on COD base, respectively. The semi-continuous reactor was dominated by Lactobacillales. Our techno-economic analysis suggests that LA production from food waste can be economically feasible, with LA recovery and low yields remaining as major obstacles. To solve both problems, we successfully applied in situ product extraction using activated carbon. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biorefinery; Food waste; Lactic acid; Microbial community; Mixed culture fermentation; Percolation system",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134948266

Coupled with intrinsic risks and costs of transnational litiga¬tion, this renders cross-border enforcement a costly and uncertain route for the attainment of justice.

Techno-economic evaluation of the process reveals great potential for the technology to be economically feasible, resulting in an investment payback rate of 8.4 years under the given conditions. Sensitivity analysis shows that the process feasibility is highly dependent on the protein availability, price of copolymer, and protein concentration. Conversely, the relatively minor influence that the price of residual proteins plays in the process economics is very beneficial from the perspective of justifying algal biofuel production. A positive economic balance for the technology is achieved for a variety of different product formulations, prices, and processing techniques. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biomaterials; Biopolymer; Biorefinery; Microalgae; Proteins",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134905406

It refers to a partisan political movement, an ideological orientation, and a set of political institutions. Common denominators are the extension of democracy to socioeconomic spheres and an expansion of government activities beyond those of merely providing national security, law and order, and a narrow set of public goods. However, such a program would seem problematic given a number of insights offered by public choice theory: All forms of majority decisions are sensitive to even small changes in the procedures and are likely to produce outcomes not preferred by a majority. Majority decisions also risk producing Pareto-inferior outcomes, especially when costs can be imposed on others. And the fewer constitutional limits on government activities there are, the larger the extent of rent seeking with associated welfare losses is likely to be. Together these points are significant challenges to a program that wants to extend majority decision to new spheres while simultaneously promising prosperity for all. © Oxford University Press 2019.

The book discusses exactly how the formation of a rural social enterprise network in Denmark started with a deep understanding of the material life in the particular community. It demonstrates how and why the two main versions of social enterprise-focused on the new capitalism and the social economy-both fail to allow for an understanding of how social enterprise emerges in the grassroots context in which communities in the South aim to address social challenges. The book explains the need to “repoliticize the depoliticized space of the present discourses around social enterprise”. It addresses how an important part of the solidarity economy, namely the popular and informal economy, is made invisible in mainstream economic and institutions discourses. The book explores social enterprises from a multi-actor perspective that distinguishes among four “institutional logics”: state, market, community and the non-profit sector. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133232542

This functional affordance has made it possible for the dispatcher to send out cleaning personnel, when a certain number of persons have used a room.

Such tensions trigger a dialectic motor of change, which in the study was named stakeholder dialectics.

Companies must necessarily develop their own sustainability strategy to reflect the company’s values and ambitions. The differences are due to the fact that companies differ in core business and facilities, but they also differ in the way they relate to sustainability and in the role and responsibility of the FM organisation. The chapter discusses the strategic positions: pollution control; smart technology; best on the market; and sustainable vision.

The word professionalisation is widely used in today’s society, referring to the way organisations and employees are being urged to work more efficiently and ‘professionally’. In professionalisation processes, the individual employee is expected to develop personal behaviour in accordance with the organisation’s goals and values. From a managerial point of view, professionalisation can be seen as a way of managing trained professionals through the development of new norms and values that hold the efficiency of the organisation over that of the autonomy of the profession.

It considers the role of global firms in each of the chronological eras of globalization. From the mid-nineteenth century thousands of firms, largely based in Western countries which had experienced the Industrial Revolution, established operations in foreign countries. The spread of global firms rested crucially on the overall political economy of the period. The growth of global firms was enabled by innovation in organizational structures which reduced the risks of operating internationally. Singer, and other large firms such as Standard Oil and Lever Brothers, co-existed with numerous small and family owned firms. The minority of firms which survived the challenge of global operations long enough to build viable businesses drove globalization by creating trade flows, constructing marketing channels, building infrastructure, and creating markets. Global firms faced much greater restrictions after World War II. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Teresa da Silva Lopes, Christina Lubinski, and Heidi J.S.

Another is the establishment of a data ethics label to increase transparency about a company’s data ethical standards. This paper explores these initiatives in depth and discusses the consequences. Danish companies might be able to establish higher levels of trust with customers, but with a primarily negative discourse surrounding the topic of data ethics and digital responsibility, this paper also discusses the possibility that high standards on digital responsibility may compromise the potential for further value creation and innovation through more data usage, safely and responsibly. Drawing on schools of philosophy as well as technological development, this paper proposes a framework for evaluating data ethics and privacy, not only in terms of things that happen that we do not like, but also regarding things that are not happening yet, but which ought to be, perhaps.

Women empowerment and gender mainstreaming are the bases of sound gender policies, especially in countries where greater gender gaps are observed, e.g. rural areas. This issue becomes particularly relevant in least developed countries, where an effective regulation is compelling. It is convened that gender equality is a powerful driver of economic development and social change, especially for its capacity of facilitating entrepreneurship. The appropriate gauging of the legal, economic, social and cultural factors determining or underlying a potential gender gap is crucial to shape and define such gender policies. Thus, it turns fundamental to attribute more robust bases to measure such phenomenon. With the scientific purpose of measuring gender gap in a more reliable way, this work aims to furnish a robust framework to compute composite indicators in the field of gender economics. We consider the weights of the different components. Thus, we apply an interval data analysis to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index.

Entrepreneurship, by contrast, foregrounds the mutual influences of individual agency and societal change. Entrepreneurship became a hot topic in academia as well. The increasing numbers of women receiving college and professional degrees meant that women were better positioned to undertake entrepreneurship and to educate themselves and others about it. Entrepreneurship spans the categories of poverty, self-employment, middle-class status, and big boot capitalist winners.

Automated technology is fundamentally different to other technologies because consumers must delegate control over a behavior to a machine. This delegation presents a range of new benefits to consumers but also comes with its risks. Technologies such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smart products have advanced significantly with developments in computing and have become more ubiquitous in everyday life, a trend that is set to continue rapidly. As such there is a need to understand how consumers interact with these technologies and the challenges and opportunities these interactions present to consumers, marketers, and policy makers. How do such technologies influence consumer well-being? What benefits and risks do consumers perceive? How do consumers treat machines? How do segments differ in their evaluations of these technologies? The special session involves a range of presentations on various automated technologies to explore these issues, and others, using qualitative and quantitative methods. The presentations in the special session are below: 1.Delegation of control to driverless cars (Orsolya Sadik-Rozsnyai, Laurent Bertrandias, and Ben Lowe)2.Beaten tracks? Application of existing innovation acceptance models on automated driving (Anne Köpsel, Sarah Selinka and Marc Kuhn)3.Slave or life partner? The effect of balance of power on the intention to adopt a companion robot (Laurent Bertrandias and Ngoc-Bich Dang)4.Quo Vadis smart home? A consumer perspective on smart home acceptance (Marco Hubert, Markus Blut and Christian Brock)5.Consumer segments and their reactions to risky situations in driverless cars: A cartoon based projective study (Laurent Bertrandias, Orsolya Sadik-Rozsnyai, and Ben Lowe) Topics for discussion were based around the applicability of existing consumer adoption models, delegation of authority, consumer well-being, benefits and risks, and associated ethical issues with automation. This will help to frame a future research agenda in the area and bring together researchers whose interests coalesce around these themes to further strengthen and build an international community of researchers in this area.

Habits are dispositions to behave in certain ways that have temporal and ontological priority over intention and reason, and play a key role in the mutual constitution of individuals and structures. Institutions influence individual behavior by influencing individuals’ habits which, when shared in an organizational context, grow into routines. The chapter assesses the impact of these insights in management journals, and shows that significant untapped opportunities for advancing management theory remain. Specifically, a habit-based conception of human agency fits phenomena involving individual-level or organization-level behavioral inertia, and therefore offers a basis for attempts to change individual behavior or induce organizational change that does not rely on incentives or information that alter, respectively, objective or perceived costs and benefits. © Francesca Gagliardi and David Gindis 2019.

However, because of years of economic recession many economists seem to have become more and more critical of the modern mainstream macroeconomics - the New Neoclassical Synthesis - and their use of the DSGE modelling approach. As such, there seems to be a bit of a gap between the mainstream textbook approach and real-life phenomena. Furthermore, the teaching method is also rather uniform among departments with an almost exclusive focus on formalized economic models. However, it is possible to teach economics from a non-mainstream perspective, as we have done for many years at Aalborg University, Denmark, where we teach economics pluralistically, incorporating both the mainstream orthodoxy and a range of heterodox approaches. Accordingly, our pedagogical philosophy emphasises the use of problem-based learning in respect of the guidelines given by a pluralistic research methodology. © Jesper Jespersen and Finn Olesen 2019.

The question is how the possible strong transformation of labor markets with a risk of fewer people having stable jobs, if any, and income will influence welfare states and their development. The chapter will investigate the issue by first a short depiction of the overall possible development on the labor market, using existing studies, and then connect this to possible variation in different countries belonging to different welfare regimes. The chapter will discuss and show differences in impact of changes on the labor market and discuss both the possible impact and disparity among welfare states in their ability to finance the welfare states in the future.

SCRM is embedded in a complex stakeholder landscape, and as a consequence, the value of SCRM is perceived differently by different stakeholders. We argue that when employing a value-based approach, risk management can be tailored to specific stakeholder needs at each step in the supply chain, while maintaining coherence with the overall objectives of the supply chain. Based on a combination of case studies carried out over 1 year in engineer-to-order project environments and arguments from literature, this chapter presents a conceptual model for developing supply-chain risk management activities that are based on the value perspectives of key stakeholder groups in a customer–supplier relationship. The value perspectives collected are positioned in the stakeholder landscape and fall into two categories. One related to the outcome and one related to the process quality of risk management. The model presented in this chapter can be used recursively to model up-stream and down-stream value perspectives of stakeholders in the supply chain. It is established to facilitate a conversation with the stakeholders, elicit their value perspectives and identify alignments and misalignments in order to customize the SCRM. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118790135

In this chapter, we analyze the three Vestas purchases of gearboxes, towers, and electronics and show how different sets of strategies are required for the successful mitigation of these risks. Based on this analysis, we propose a simple supply risk management framework, which can help managers mitigate disruption risk.

This research aims to advance theoretical and managerial understandings around the management of supply chain disruptions. A two-stage research process is used which focuses first on polling academic experts. This stage is followed by the extraction of insights from practitioners in the automotive, electronics and food industries. Our findings coalesce around: (1) the types of disruptions that respondents are most concerned about; (2) the associated strategies suggested to cope with disruptions; and, (3) how resilience can be measured. It is apparent that there are some areas where academics and practitioners agree and others where they agree to a lesser extent. Both sets of actors tend to agree on how resilience can be quantified, with recovery time the preferred indicator. However, there is a discrepancy around how resilience is achieved within the supply chain. Academics emphasise the importance of redundancy while practitioners refer more to flexibility. Also, they disagree around what constitutes “key disruptions”: academics suggested high-profile events, while practitioners are more concerned with day-to-day problems. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Disruption; Expert interviews; Supply chain resilience",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118773506

One prevalent socially responsible practice is to recruit otherwise ‘vulnerable’ groups on the labour market, such as migrants, the unskilled and the long-time unemployed. These recruitment practices are often made sense of by managers as benevolent acts of care, casting companies as ethically correct while making up for an unjust, excluding labour market. Relying on vignettes from three Danish companies concerned with recruiting migrants, it is explored how these apparent acts of care paradoxically are linked to paternalism and racialized hierarchies privileging majority (Danish) values and norms, as ‘vulnerable’ groups, such as migrants are employed in temporary training positions financed though state-subsidized inclusive labour-market schemes. As such, migrants are casted as dependent on benevolent managers to help them integrate into Danish labour market culture. Migrants are expected to demonstrate gratitude for being granted access to the labour market, while simultaneously being linked to lack and deficiency, invalidating their professional skills to the detriment of respectful interaction. In consequence, organisational practitioners are blinded to the fact that these socially responsible acts may sustain organisational and societal inequality based on race. Instead, it is suggested that sentiments of solidarity rather than care is necessary to obtain reciprocal respect and recognition among workers that avoids reducing minority members to mere representatives of (stigmatized) social groups. Following Fraser, sometimes the best way to protect these ‘diverse workers’ is to fight for better working conditions for them: to bring in social justice by not only recognizing but also adequately rewarding differences through redistributive measures of equal pay and permanent, higher-status positions. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118416749

In spite of the many formal regulations of health care, hospitals are also chaotic organizing places where many different groups of people interact in order to negotiate, to practice, and to make sense of daily work tasks. The underlying argument is that, in the mundane everyday life of hospitals, frontline workers and their interactions with patients and local managers remain at the core of organizing hospitals.

These trends are likely to continue, so big data in that sense is not likely to go away. However, big data (or dataism), is seen as something more than a description of several connected threads and is often melded into prediction and prescription. Here, big data is the answer to many problems, and the claim and promise of the digital society is to improve firms’ competitiveness and public organizations’ provision of welfare services to the citizens as end-users. Of course, the spread of big data as a unified package owes much to consultants and the pressures on organizations.

Currently forest or woody biomass makes up the largest contribution to bioenergy production, but future supply potentials include dedicated production of biomass for energy or biorefineries and an increased use of agricultural or forest residues. By 2050 a technical potential of agricultural residues between 10 and 66 EJ has been identified, constituting a significant resource. Also processing residues and food waste constitute a significant biomass resource each with a potential between 5 and 50 EJ per year by 2050. Residue biomass, be it from the field or from processing of agricultural produce, has a low cost compared to other biomass resources. However, due to its low energy density and geographically dispersed production, long-range transport is prohibitively costly, which could limit the biorefinery concept from being broadly implemented. Development towards densification and to ensure uniform material characteristics may reduce cost and risk in the supply chain. A significant resource base at a reasonable cost and with a manageable risk is not enough to ensure mobilisation of the resource and the establishment of a viable supply chain. A number of institutional, technical, social and economic barriers must be overcome. A consistent policy framework that supports a bioeconomy, biorefineries or production based on biomass and waste is required. Awareness about credible knowledge on process costs and sustainability aspects must be developed among stakeholders along the supply chain. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Bioenergy; Biomass; Biomass costs; Biomass mobilisation; Biorefinery; Feedstock; High-value products",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114978575

The core argument is that countries that adopt a well-structured approach towards SEZs that they can align with the broader development strategy, executive effectively, and continuously evaluate and manoeuvre over time, are more successful in achieving SEZ-led economic transformation than others. This requires strategic bureaucratic competencies to make the right choices and set clear strategic directions; strategic bureaucratic learning to dynamically and interactively engage in adjusting the strategies when needed; and strategic bureaucratic strengths to implement the strategy effectively. These elements in turn need an effective political leadership with a strong development focus that can energise and motivate bureaucracies. The study revisits the experience of successful, not-so-successful and least successful countries across the globe within this framework and concludes by raising some pertinent concerns about SEZ-led development strategy that emerge from the analysis. © 2019 UNCTAD United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.

Thus, by simply reporting the model, producer, and type of eye tracker, other researchers have the chance to consult online documentation of the specific eye-tracking devices and appraise the eye tracker’s quality and it’s fit to the respective research design. Reporting on data quality in eye-tracking studies can refer to several measures most of which are common to all eye-tracking studies.

It discusses a typical research project beginning with research questions and progressing to experimental design, implementation of the experiment, data collection, data preprocessing and analysis, and finally interpretation of results. The chapter focuses on examples from JDM, but the issues raised relate equally to other areas of the behavioral sciences as well. Eye-tracking research in JDM can be classified along a decision versus vision science dimension. A key challenge for all types of eye-tracking research in JDM, and particularly for studies using eye-tracking as a process measure, is how to derive predictions about eye movements in decision making. When designing eye-tracking experiments it is necessary to consider the exposure time of stimuli. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Michael Schulte- Mecklenbeck, Anton Kühberger, and Joseph G.

We study the translocal actors in community development on four Nordic islands. Taking translocal networks and engagements into account brings into view the flows of people and their resources available in translocal networks, relations and hubs of engagement – thereby highlighting a hitherto understudied aspect of the development and branding of rural places. Translocal actors pose new challenges to place-branding theory, in that they play into a community-based place governance and contribute considerably to brand renewal, but in a bottom-up and multi-local approach. Translocal networks extend the place branding concept of scale, from a single-area focus to a focus on networks and connections, which imply foci on multiple geographical areas, as well as a dynamic element of scale, thus challenging the concept of place in place branding. © Cecilia Cassinger, Andrea Lucarelli and Szilvia Gyimóthy 2019.

The change has been activity driven, brought about by “Nordic-style” consensual governance by the city council, a “pre-branding” iterative process to build local support, explorative skunk work on new content, timing, systematic documentation – and time. Serial international music events, the annual Medieval Festival and the permanent Prison Museum have been crucial elements in the process. Solicited and unsolicited information from friends who have visited THE PRISON, printed media and TV about the new activities have been equally important sources of people’s knowledge about THE PRISON. The case illustrates the importance of a careful “pre-branding” process and a holistic approach to communication, and indicates that theories about stakeholder involvement are more dependent upon different national local governance than hitherto anticipated. © Cecilia Cassinger, Andrea Lucarelli and Szilvia Gyimóthy 2019.

In addition, the supply of immediacy has become more elastic with respect to its price. Consistent with a stringent regulatory environment incentivizing smaller dealer inventories, we also find that dealers revert deviations from their target inventory more quickly after the crisis. Finally, we investigate the pricing impact of information, changes in ownership structure, and differences between bank and nonbank dealers. &copy; 2018 The Author(s) .

When looking at definitions and understandings of the social and solidarity economy, one issue stands out as particularly significant: that of how research links the organizational analysis of particular social enterprises to societal dimensions at the macro-level. In the social economy tradition, social enterprise is a matter of organizational criteria and specificities. Following M. Granovetter, the solidarity economy analysis of social enterprise does not stop by only analyzing the specific organizational capacities and characteristics of a certain social enterprise, but insists on understanding how it is embedded in that larger societal framework. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104844819

Our results show that meaning of traditions, social hygge, inclusiveness and egalitarian values are centrally held resources for brand constructions.

Within the digital welfare state, a new model of the provision of public welfare services to citizens as end-users on the basis of dataism is emerging. Dataism is defined as a belief in the logic of data – that data, not humans, can determine which public welfare services are best for citizens. The emerging model positions data analysts as a key profession, they hold the key to the model: digital algorithms. In addition, the emerging model has the potential to resolve the blind (weak) spots of the public welfare service semi-professionals’ ideal four-step model of the provision of welfare services to citizens. At present, the semi-professionals’ model dominates. The model reflects relationshipism. Relationshipism is defined as a belief in the logic of trust-based relationships between public welfare service semi-professionals and citizens – that trust-based relationships, not data, can determine which services are best for citizens. Consequently, trust-based dialogues between public welfare service semi-professionals and citizens in combination with co-production and co-delivery of public welfare services are the core of the public welfare service semi-professionals’ ideal model. Because the emerging model has the potential to resolve the blind (weak) spots of the public welfare service semi-professionals’ ideal model, it also has the potential to outcompete the semi-professionals’ model. © John Storm Pedersen and Adrian Wilkinson 2019.

We understand robustness in terms of plausibility, which in most research traditions is denoted as validity and reliability. A further important contribution of this paper is to provide insight into the structuring of intervention-based research in combination with non-interventionist type methods, thereby providing impetus for a ‘qualitative mixed-methods approach’. Based on a decade of interventionist research relating to value creation in the context of network-based business models including over 100 companies, this paper illustrates the importance of pre-conception and organization of data-structures and research objectives. We argue that interventionist research projects should adhere to a set number of stages and that the motivation for intervention should be linked to expected learning outcomes and how the contribution from the intervention leads to a value-added contribution in comparison to carrying out non-interventionist type research; for example, through the creation of organizational and personal narratives. Finally, the application of intervention and non-intervention creates a strong format for plausible research outputs. © 2019 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

These shocks can change technology trajectories and make irrelevant existing regulatory frameworks. It is unclear, however, what the interplay between technology evolution, entrepreneurship, and regulation is. We explore the case of the emergence of the drone industry to extract insights on how different profiles of new entrants respond to distinct regulatory frameworks, aiming to decipher the effect that those regulatory frameworks have on the exploration and development of new tech-based innovation opportunities. Our findings suggest that more attention should be given to the impact that regulatory responses can have on the short- and long-term development of emerging technological fields.

In the Internet era, innovation intelligence is transferred across borders and languages at an unprecedented rate, yet the ability to benefit from it seems to become more divergent among different corporations and countries. How much an organization can benefit from innovation largely depends on how well innovation is managed in it. Thus, there is a discernible increase in interest in the study of innovation management. This handbook provides a comprehensive guide to this subject. The handbook introduces the basic framework of innovation and innovation management. It also presents innovation management from the perspectives of strategy, organization and resource, as well as institution and culture.

Meanwhile, many people are concerned about the unchecked powers of tech giants and the hidden operations of big data, artificial intelligence and algorithms and call for more openness and insight. How do we - as individuals, companies and societies - deal with these technological and social transformations? Seen through the prism of digital technologies and data, our lives take new shapes and we are forced to manage our visibilities carefully. This book challenges common ways of thinking about transparency, and argues that the management of visibilities is a crucial, but overlooked force that influences how people live, how organizations work, and how societies and politics operate in a digital, datafied world. Shows how digital transformations have consequences for how we see, know and govern Gives readers a new vocabulary for talking and thinking about tech companies, big data and their social and political consequences Interdisciplinary in scope, this book will appeal to graduate students, researchers and policymakers working in fields including media and communications studies, information and communication studies, organisation studies, organisational sociology, Internet and law. © Mikkel Flyverbom 2019.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097360469

When the government switched in May 2010 to zero growth in public consumption and to significant cuts in social protection, this left exports as the only possible driver of growth. It took ten years for private consumption per capita to catch up with 2007 levels, while the number of public employees declined by 5 per cent from 2010 to 2016. Welfare and tax reforms since 2008 have contributed to an erosion of social citizenship, accompanied by strong rhetoric questioning the deservingness of people in a vulnerable position. Whereas the weakest groups are at risk of being excluded from social protection, the long-term decline in welfare services may ‘crowd in’ private welfare for the upper middle classes. © Oxford University Press 2019.","Cuts; Denmark; Deservingness; Private consumption; Vulnerable; Welfare state",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096325833

The book traces the history of the ultimately unsuccessful attempts to create an English Folk Museum over the course of the early and mid-twentieth century. It provides a critique of a very different top-down heritage initiative and describes a description of a group of Cheltenham-based Gloucester Rugby Club supporters travelling to a home match by train. The book explores the marketing materials of several British tourist and heritage organisations to highlight the paradox behind the use of the metaphor of their being ‘hidden’ in order to promote visits to heritage sites. It focuses on the far less common use of stifling structures to commemorate the relationships and interactions between humans and animals.

Given the DDA’s slow progress, that implementation may not be completed before the end of the next decade. Ex-ante analysis of the DDA’s possible effects thus requires first modelling the world economy to 2030 and, in that process, projecting what trade-related policies might be by then without a DDA. Typically, modellers assume the counterfactual policy regime to be a ‘business-as-usual’ projection assuming the status quo. Yet we know developing country governments tend to switch from taxing to assisting farmers in the course of economic development. This paper shows the difference made by including political economy-determined agricultural protection growth endogenously in the baseline projection. We reveal that difference by projecting the world economy to 2030 using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model with those two alternative policy regimes and then simulating a move to global free trade (the maximum benefit from a multilateral trade reform) in each of those two cases. The welfare effects of removing the counterfactual price distortions in 2030 are shown to be much larger in the case where agricultural protection grows endogenously than in the case assuming no policy changes over the projection period. This suggests the traditional way of estimating effects of a multilateral agricultural trade agreement may considerably understate the potential welfare gains. © 2020 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Some aspects of our pasts are venerated and memorialised for a variety of reasons, while others are forgotten or even hidden. This volume, thus, provides examples from across a spectrum. Some phenomena are well-suited to heritagisation, such as animals memorialised for their bravery, long past agricultural techniques and implements, and impressive landscapes. However, this book also deals with products (e.g. tobacco), historical periods (e.g. the Third Reich) and scientific techniques (e.g. genetic modification) with negative connotations that extend beyond their heritage attributes. This volume considers how the actors in the heritage industry admit, valorise, prioritise and rationalise historic resources as heritage products. These findings provide practical examples of how heritage institutions privilege, frame and/or exclude a wide range of heritage items. They also contrast the invocations of sectional (local, national or class based) and more cosmopolitan heritages and consider the extent to which innovation and change are or can be acknowledged within the heritage discourse. © 2020 Thomas Carter, David C.

They are integrated in such a way that when a travel menu is offered, predicted conditions are considered in the attributes of alternatives and optimized system-level policies are maintained. Similarly, user-level estimations and updates are used by prediction and optimization methods at the system-level in order to represent the population with most up-to-date behavioral estimates. Furthermore, a simulation-based evaluation methodology enables to validate the performance of prediction, optimization, and personalization before Smart Mobility is implemented in real-life. Two case studies are presented based on the proposed methodologies together with platforms that facilitate their application. Potential benefits of the proposed methodologies are evaluated which can be classified into user-level and system-level benefits. User-level benefits include consumer surplus, waiting times, etc., and system-level is concerned with congestion, throughput, system-wide travel time, etc. As there is normally a tradeoff between the individual decision-making and system-wide decision-making, Smart Mobility bridges them together with appropriate methodologies on each end. For example, for our Flexible Mobility on Demand case study, we observe 10%-20% reduction in volume-to-capacity ratio as a system-level benefit. Moreover, we see that the tradeoff between consumer surplus and operator profit can be managed with an appropriate objective function. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Our literature review of the environmental benefits related to the adoption of precision agriculture solutions is aimed at raising farmers’ and other stakeholders’ awareness of the actual environmental impacts from this set of new technologies. Existing studies were categorised according to the environmental impacts of different agricultural activities: nitrogen application, lime application, pesticide application, manure application and herbicide application. Our findings highlighted the effects of the reduction of input application rates and the consequent impacts on climate, soil, water and biodiversity. Policy makers can benefit from the outcomes of this study developing an understanding of the environmental impact of precision agriculture in order to promote and support initiatives aimed at fostering sustainable agriculture.

Beyond that, it has also established a new method of innovation marketing, especially for high-tech products: using crowdfunding to find out if there is a market for the product. However, this possibility requires the tailoring of entrepreneurial commercialization strategies for crowdfunding platforms as product markets. This chapter offers insights into crowdfunding behavior, and how technology entrepreneurs can make use of it. For this, a market theory perspective is taken on crowdfunding platforms, with implications for theory and practice. © François Thérin, Francesco Paolo Appio and Hyungseok Yoon 2019.

Research has yet to investigate how the two perspectives might lead to different understandings of how consumer identity is created. This affects consumers’ interaction with brands. The authors investigate how each research position is grounded in very different assumptions related to whether consumers are active versus passive users of mental models as toolkits for generating sense of self (identity) and brands. They raise and discuss the question of whether cognitive processing ultimately is governed by a “meta-cognition” which roams free in the mind, and chooses among lower-lying mental models along with associated language tropes, metaphors, metonyms; or a meta-cognition that is determined by yet another mental model that provides the scripts of how to meta-cognize.

However, the chapter emphasizes that NGOs must ensure that these efforts draw on past experiences and established knowledge, and ensure who has access to the solutions and with what consequences. It is imperative that NGOs continuously experiment to pursue different ways of engaging in social transformations and development; and to organize themselves differently and stand for an alternative way of thinking development through sustainable tourism. © Richard Sharpley and David Harrison 2019.

The theoretical section traces this silencing to paradigmatic differences in feminist research. In contrast, this chapter outlines an example of critical female readership, through a reception study of the Fifty Shades trilogy. Building on interviews with female readers and online fan-fiction and discussion forums on social media, the chapter argues that women indeed are critical and reflexive readers. Further, that by paying attention to and acknowledging the paradigmatic differences within feminist scholarship, we come to understand why and how feminist research can forward opposing views of women, men, and their abilities for critical thinking and action. © Susan Dobscha 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089053393

This Schumpeterian view may be contrasted with an alternative view that in many cases social entrepreneurship may be better understood as a result of collective action, involving groups of citizens (often with supporting stakeholders), or organisations, or networks and social movements. This collective model of social entrepreneurship may be defined as “collaboration amongst similar as well as diverse actors for the purpose of applying business principles to solving social problems” (p376, Montgomery, Dacin, and Dacin, 2012). The chapter draws on key papers in the literature to identify different types of collective social entrepreneurship, relating to different phases of development: New start, transformations, and growth.

The first case shows how data-driven management is deployed in a hospital in Region Hovedstaden (Capital Region of Denmark). The focus is on how data-driven management supports organizational performance. Danish hospitals and the Danish healthcare system in general both have a long-standing tradition of data-driven treatments that support data-driven management in Danish hospitals. The second case investigates under what conditions it is possible to establish data-driven management in an environment without any tradition of data-driven decision-making processes. The focus is on how data-driven management can help to improve the provision of public welfare services to long-term unemployed citizens to help them to get jobs. The services are provided by social workers within Jobcenter Vordingborg located in Vordingborg Municipality. On the basis of the two cases of data-driven management these four questions are answered: (1) Where is data-driven management going? (2) Is the development desirable? (3) What, if anything, should we do about data-driven management? (4) Who gains and who loses because of data-driven management, and by which mechanisms of power? One of the key conclusions is: the creation of a delicate balance between top-down and bottom-up management is a must for data-driven management to work in practice. © John Storm Pedersen and Adrian Wilkinson 2019.

We estimate a TSR model using data from 132 listed commercial European and North American banks. First, we demonstrate that banks that have publicly adopted VBM in their operative Management Control Systems (MCS) outperform non-VBM-banks. On average, VBM-adopters generate a 5.8%-points higher annual TSR. They also outperform non-VBM-banks in terms of profitability, growth, and liquidity. Second, we find that banks focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the cost-income ratio, which are sub-optimal indicators of TSR. We suggest the implementation of indicators that are more closely related to TSR, such as return on assets or loan loss provisioning. So far, only a few banks (10%-45%) have considered these KPIs in their MCS. A shift towards our suggested KPIs might even further improve the performance of VBM-adopters.

Three hundred and thirty-five Danish firms in the European Manufacturing Survey reveal that individual knowledge must be differently organised to achieve different innovative outcomes. For new product development, organisations benefit from investing in employees with the highest possible domain-specific absorptive capacity, whilst for product-related service innovations, employees with more general knowledge should be hired. For the latter, employees’ individual absorptive capacity should be developed internally for best innovation outcomes. Irrespective of the type of innovation, providing flexible work arrangements is beneficial for performance and this effect is further substantiated by firm’s cross-functional capabilities. Important implications emerge for the organisation in terms of outsourcing versus developing individual absorptive capacity for different innovations. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.","Individual absorptive capacity; individual knowledge; new product development; organisational capabilities; product-related service innovations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087788341

Instead of approaching the-becoming-responsible of business as a linear process that involves different stages of development, we argue that responsibilization needs to be seen as a contested political process that involves complex power dynamics and conflicts between different interests and rationalities in the organization. The main contribution of the chapter is conceptual. We apply Foucault’s notion of governmentality (along with his concept of power) and show how it can provide important insights into the internal workings of CSR and challenge taken-for-granted notions of how businesses are supposed to become responsible. The analytical themes that sustain the analysis are governmentality, power, subjectivity and translation. The main contribution of the chapter is to show how these four themes, viewed individually and in conjunction through a Foucauldian lens, allow for a more nuanced theoretical understanding of what makes or breaks responsibility in modern business.

From early forms of philanthropy up to contemporary corporate social responsibility (CSR) business has faced and responded to societal expectations beyond its pure economic functions. The rise of global capitalism (often characterized as ‘neo liberal’) in the last four decades has coincided with a widespread proliferation of business practices that see the responsibility for the public good as an intrinsic part of private profit maximization. The spread of global capitalism has thus been accompanied by the proliferation of business activities in favour of the public good, driven by corporate discretion and self-interest. In 2008, the authors termed such an assumption of social responsibility by business as ‘explicit CSR’ – as opposed to ‘implicit CSR’. The chapter critically examines the ‘implicit/explicit’ CSR dichotomy in the light of a decade of research on comparative CSR that has engaged with the proposed framework at various levels. We discuss three major research questions. We question the accuracy and usefulness of the proposed ‘implicit/explicit’ CSR dichotomy by looking at a number of empirical studies and conceptual suggestions that posit a much more unilinear character of neo-liberal forms of capitalism and the concomitant spread of explicit CSR. We also discuss empirical work that has looked at hybrid forms of implicit and explicit CSR to ask how implicit and explicit CSR interact. Finally, we raise questions as to the future of specific forms of CSR. © Joanne B. Ciulla and Tobey K. Scharding 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087666832

We suggest that this period of pessimism is an apt moment to take long-lens perspective on Brazil’s historical quest for status. To be sure, the “rise of Brazil narrative” was certainly ubiquitous, but prior research has lacked a means of assessing the extent to which international recognition for Brazil’s rise was forthcoming. Therefore, to complement existing research into Brazil’s status seeking, we provide a systematic evaluation and analysis of Brazil’s status performance between 1970 and 2010. To what extent was Brazil able to translate its economic resources into international status across the period? Compared to its BRICS peers, did Brazils status seeking bring about relative improvement in international recognition? To this end, we put to work a recently developed mixed-methods framework for systematically assessing and comparing countries’ status performance across time. Our results will be chastening to Brazilians but not entirely surprising. In short, our findings suggest that not only does Brazil underperform compared to its status resources, but also that it performs worse than any of its BRICS peers. While Brazilian politicians have tended to blame the P5 for excluding them from the high status “in group”, our findings show that Brazil has also struggled with recognition from smaller powers for a prolonged period stretching from the 1970s and into the twenty-first century. © The Author(s) 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085833930

The findings highlight that entrepreneurs experience a heightened societal trust and increased support, yet a lack of institutional trust.

It also disseminates knowledge on organic and sustainable food production, distribution, and consumption and aims to develop a participatory and inclusive community organisation. Some scholars see such alternative food networks as having great potential for creating environmentally and economically sustainable societies, while others see them as a way of ‘de-politicising’ the local. We intervene in this debate, using in particular Bang’s distinction between mode 1 (traditional) and mode 2 politics (network politics) and an actor-network methodology. We find that rather than being ‘apolitical’, CFC is ‘double political’ in the sense that members are involved in mode 1 as well as mode 2 politics. So, vegetables are indeed political. However, they need not be. For some stakeholders the story of the CFC is synonymous with community or health, which implies that the organisation is non-political. However, we have chosen to tell the story of CFC as a political topos, a story that allows us to demonstrate not only the political, but also some of the organisation’s economic, cultural, and discursive traces. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084910010

The chapter discusses four different ways through which Danish environmental communities (eco-villages, food cooperatives, and environmental associations) make a difference. (1) Environmental communities create collective identities and a process of norm convergence among members. (2) Environmental communities design new physical and social infrastructures influencing behaviour, first at the grassroots level and then with spillover effects in local municipalities. (3) Because there is a continuous turnover among community members, the information that people learn and acquire while they are members of an environmental association is spread to the wider community when they leave it. (4) Environmental associations influence policy-makers either because their members tend to be fiery souls and idealists who are more likely to engage into local politics than others or because the size and dynamism of these associations make them interesting to the media and politicians. Environmental communities thus influence society as collective identities, as new infrastructures, as educational institutions, and as political institutions. All these aspects are grounded in collective action rather than in individual choices. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084907750

Through a series of wide-ranging case studies from the UK, Australia, Germany, Italy and Denmark, and a number of comparative case studies, the volume provides an empirically and theoretically robust argument that highlights the need to develop, widen and scale up collective action and community-based engagement if the transition to sustainability is to be successful.

In this chapter, I explore the governance structures of TMNs in order to enhance our understanding of these emerging institutions, their institutional set-up, and their display and positioning of power. While existing studies of the subject offer an understanding of how TMNs operate across scales, sectors, and actors, we have a limited understanding of the governance tools provided by these networks. I propose a framework that enables a systematic analysis of the governance tools provided by TMNs based on traditional soft and hard distinctions of governance. Through an empirical in-depth study of a particular TMN, 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), I show that we need to broaden our understanding of the governance mechanisms used in transnational city governance. I suggest that key governance tools offered by 100 Resilient Cities are developed from the top-down and framed by the 100RC’s central organisation. However, these tools do allow for local interpretation and application that invite different political actors with different contextual constraints to act together on a changing world. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084894329

Some might argue that this newer way of understanding sustainability is just a more precise specification of the Brundtland definition, while others might argue that it is definitively more radical, as Raworth directly encourages us to be ‘agnostic about growth’.

Based on insights from anthropological fieldwork in three Danish eco-communities, the chapter describes how the well-organised physical and social structures in eco-communities promote sustainable behaviour among residents. For instance, people are more self-sufficient when they produce their own food, and they share more when they become members of eco-communities. At the same time, however, it is also important to the residents to avoid being self-righteous or too idealistic and to also avoid interfering with other people’s choices about, for example, being vegetarian or joining communal dinners. The sustainable behaviour that takes place in eco-communities does not happen for exclusively idealistic reasons, it also happens on pragmatic grounds. Hence, a balance between sustainable practice, collective engagement, and individual freedom is crucial in order to ensure the liveability of eco-communities. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084863862

Identifying the commercial software that could better support a company’s business processes is a demanding effort. Current software selection methods do not always take advantage of the knowledge that can be embedded in various types of business reference models. This paper presents initial insights into the application of reference models for business process to support software selection. The approach relies on an integrated process-software reference model, which may be linked to a capabilities database of commercially available software. Based on a case application to product lifecycle management (PLM), the advantages and drawbacks of extensive reference model usage on software selection are discussed. Results indicate that business reference models have the potential to facilitate and enhance software selection. However, the high effort to build the integrated process-software model needs to be considered on overall benefits estimation.

A resource-based perspective of value creation in clusters to develop a better conceptualisation of strategic competitive advantage on different levels is also a relevant topic from a strategic management perspective. Therefore, the aim of this research is to strengthen and extend a resource-oriented perspective on clusters, according to the value adding web (VAW) approach developed by Brown et al. (e.g., 2008, 2010). This contribution complements the state of the art of contemporary concepts with a coherent fundament for the resource-based value adding web concept and thereby develops the basis for further empirical studies. In this conceptual paper, we focus on the interaction between actors and relationships as sources for value creation within clusters as well as gaining a better understanding of value creation based on shared relational resources. We illustrate this approach through a discussion of a maritime cluster. Specifically the role of social capital and the relevance of knowledge-related resources on different cluster levels is elaborated.

As the basic unit of organisms, single cells have diversity, heterogeneity, and dynamics that can be delineated only by obtaining the omics information from each cell, as opposed to assessing the average signal from a complex cell population. Single-cell omics technologies have been applied to studying cell heterogeneity in a broad range of complex biological systems, including microbial ecosystems, tumors, the nervous system, and embryos, to provide detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity that were not available through conventional techniques. Single-cell omics has brought about revolutions in multiple fields of biological studies. Recent single-cell omics studies on cancers have provided extensive details of cell heterogeneity in individual tumors, opening a view to initial basis of the molecular mechanism of tumor initiation, intratumoral heterogeneity, cancer invasion, drug resistance, and tumor metastasis, as well as cancer microenvironment. Dissecting the composition of different cell types and cell states throughout a biological system, known as distinguishing distinct “identities” of cells, is another important new area of single-cell omics-as seen in the Human Cell Atlas Project, which ambitiously is aiming to classify cells into types and create a comprehensive spectrum of all human cells. Moreover, interrogating cell heterogeneity by single-cell omics has further paved the way for investigating a variety of complex diseases and biological processes, including neurological disorders, immune diseases, and even aging.

It draws on resource-based view and the theory of first mover (dis)advantages to examine the implications of the timing of acquisitions on innovation in family firms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a panel data set of Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 manufacturing firms followed over a period of 31 years. Findings: The study finds empirical support for the predictions that family firms are more able to utilize acquired resources better than nonfamily firms. Furthermore, targets acquired during the upswing of a merger wave are more valuable to family firms and associated with more innovation than for nonfamily firms. Originality/value: The paper establishes that resources acquired during the upswing of a merger wave are more valuable, provide better resource synergies and impact innovation positively in family firms than nonfamily firms. Second, the paper makes an empirical contribution that family firms absorb external resources markedly differently and more efficiently than nonfamily firms. Third, the paper enhances a better understanding of the influence of family ownership on the relationship between acquisitions and innovation outputs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acquisitions; Family firms; Innovation; Merger waves; Resource-based view",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081593166

Its main frameworks have been provided by Occidental approaches. Mainly based on an organizational vision, they give little or no room to questions such as gender, race, colonialism, class, power relations and intertwined forms of inequality. However, a wide range of worldwide hidden, popular initiatives can be considered as another form of social enterprises based on solidarity, re-embedding the economy as well as broadening the political scope. This has been shown in a previous book: Civil Society, the Third Sector, and Social Enterprise: Governance and Democracy. Thus, to be more than a fashion or a fictitious panacea, the concept of social enterprise needs to be debated. Southern realities cannot be only understood through imported categories and outside modeled guidelines. This book engages a multicontinental and pluridisciplinary discussion in order to provide a pluralist theory of social enterprise.

The purpose of this paper is to review and understand SIP from a management of technology perspective with respect to innovation drivers and stakeholders, maturing of technology, types of successful configurations and a projection of technological design most likely to succeed to a market level of productivity. Key findings are that the area until now has been technology driven, secondly it seems like brand-driven, to a lesser extent supply chain, retail and consumers have been driving forces in the area. Originality of this paper attributes to the study of SIP as a technology in its early stages having passed a number of critical gates on the way to a largely adoption in the industry; the vision of “everything connected” is technologically demanding and socially challenging and research is fundamental to responsible priorities of investments and technological enablement. Research implications of this paper relates to, in the view of technology as driver, how complex and loose networks of technological development can support or fail to support each other to achieve useful outcomes. Furthermore is interesting to study that complex technologies like semiconductors, conductive inks, graphene-based printing is first developed in large organisations, then matured in smaller start-ups, and then again adopted by the largest global players. The social implications of the area are large and widespread with retailing being one of the largest industries, and CPGs being consumed by the global consumer. © IAMOT 2019.","Consumer Packaged Goods; Management of Technology; Smart Interactive Packaging; Technology Foresight; Technology Studies","Augmented reality; Complex networks; Graphene; Industrial management; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Consumer packaged goods; Digital elements; Global consumers; Management of technology; Social implication; Technological development; Technology foresight; Wireless connectivities; Internet protocols",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081100025

The public sector has served an important purpose in making services such as education, health, and social care, as well as security services, accessible to all citizens. In this qualitative study, we have investigated the future consumption of welfare services to better understand what different scenarios we might face given rapid tech development, changing consumer behaviors, aging population, urbanization, and scarce human resources to cater to future needs. Qualitative interviews and a workshop with representatives from both public and private sectors have been carried out. We see four different scenarios emerge: 1) data-driven state, 2) commercialized welfare, 3) efficiency game, and 4) global choice. The scenarios differ in terms of consumer behavior and which players dominate the market. Our overall conclusion is that Sweden is placed at a critical crossroad where we need to collaborate across disciplines to formulate and decide upon a shared vision and a strategy to safeguard continued high-quality services to all citizens. There is an urgent need to create a citizen-centric, data-driven, digitalized welfare system based on future demands rather than on historic legacy. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Anthony Larsson and Robin Teigland.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079297645

In this paper, we identify three processes by which individual systems become embedded into digital infrastructures. First, there are parallel processes, in which systems become embedded independently of each other. Second, there are competitive processes, in which the embeddedness of one system increases at the expense of another. Finally, there are spanning processes, in which bridges are built between different embedded systems. The three processes, synthesized into a dynamic model of digital infrastructure embeddedness, offer much-needed conceptual clarity to the area of digital infrastructure evolution. They also provide insight into the emergence of three forms of digital infrastructures: silofied, regenerated, and unified. Reflecting an interconnection view, our research further facilitates an understanding of infrastructure inertia and its associated consequence.

In such regions, high-value products as proteins, pigments, and fatty acids can be extracted from microalgae, which can be cultivated on nonproductive lands (deserts included). In this study, we examine the potential use of microalgae as a source of biomass in the UAE. Three strains, Chlorella, Euglena, and Scenedesmus, found in the Gulf of the Arabian Sea are analyzed to identify the proper type of microalgae in creating valuable products. Chlorella shows strong resistance against high salinity and temperature, which make it a good potential source of proteins, pigments, and fatty acids for the UAE. Based on the Chlorella results, a full biorefinery is designed with the aim of producing 10 tons of proteins per day along with pigments (sodium copper chlorophylls) and saponified fatty acids (lipids). Then, an economical evaluation is conducted for the three products (proteins, pigments, and lipids) using the software SuperPro Designer. From the economical evaluation, it was identified that the three products generate revenues of 173, 906, 000$/year with a payback time of 2.62 years. This result suggests that the potential use of microalgae biorefinery to create revenues based on the suggested products is greatly promising in the UAE and other coastal arid/semiarid regions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Biorefinery; Chlorella; Euglena; Fatty acids; Pigments; Proteins; Scenedesmus",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079074671

We consider two types of followers: developers (those directly involved in software development) and observers (those indirectly involved in it). We conduct a series of empirical investigations by using a longitudinal dataset of OSS projects hosted in GitHub, along with a survey and qualitative data. We find that followership can affect code reuse, but the effect depends on the nature of the follower (developer or observer). Overall, our study suggests that followership is important for code reuse in OSS because it enables participants to learn, and learning promotes code reuse. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

For industrial players in an ecosystem, it can be both a threat and an opportunity. Furthermore, the new technologies open collaboration opportunities between corporates and start-ups. But it remains unclear what are the consequences of opening up and whether it has an impact on the innovation dynamics in the industrial ecosystem. We use the case of the wind industry in Denmark, as a maturing industrial ecosystem, to study when and how the new entrants (technology entrepreneurs) have had an impact on the innovation dynamics. We first combine archival data with interviews to build a historical account of the evolution of the industrial ecosystem; then we incorporate data from the new entrants in the industry to specify the types of innovations that the most recent digital technology entrepreneurs have triggered. The results suggest differences in the innovation dynamics depending on the value chain position. While some activities have remained rather closed (for instance, the technological development of the core elements in the wind turbines), the operations and maintenance activities have profited from digital technologies introduced by new entrants. Using these insights, we present and discuss suggestions to institutional actors interested in protecting the innovation leadership of their regional industrial ecosystems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Digital entrepreneurship; Digital innovation; Innovation ecosystem; Wind industry",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078787380

About 5000 measurements were taken from the elicited investor pitches, and the acoustic results were cross-validated by 31 listeners who judged excerpts of all pitches in terms of perceived speaker charisma. On this basis, this chapter provides empirical evidence that the traditional rehearsal setting degrades the charismatic tone of voice of a speaker with each new repetition of the investor pitch. Rehearsing in a virtual reality (VR) environment, on the other hand, counteracts this erosion effect and even results in a gradual improvement of the speaker’s charismatic tone of voice. Initial findings also indicate that this positive VR effect persists when speakers return from the virtual to the traditional rehearsal setting. The results are discussed with respect to their implications for practitioners and for further research and development of digital learning technologies in entrepreneurship education. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Charisma; Digital learning; Investor pitch; Prosody; Rhetoric; Virtual reality",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078739481

It was written in response to some questions that the current and the former IJAR editors-in-chief asked us to reflect on. We did so gratefully, because this was a good opportunity to look back on 25 years of doing AR in organisations. The article describes four challenges of future organisational action research. Firstly, in the future an increasing number of skilled employees will make it necessary to move from co-influence of how to implement goals, to a greater degree of co-determination. Secondly, the article argues there is a need for an increased focus on documenting AR processes. Thirdly, the article calls for more self-critical reflections on the concrete ways action researchers exercise power. Fourthly, questioning the possibilities of doing AR in organisations will become important in the future, due to socio-economic conditions such as lack of time. The article is based on a four-year research project that we carried out on various American and European approaches to action research in organisations in the 20th century. It includes, too, a description of our different personal ways into AR and some of the AR concepts we developed along the way. © 2019, Verlag Barbara Budrich.

Such initiatives are often (self-)described in the language of ‘community’, or fællesskab in Danish, thereby also evoking a contested term from the social sciences. To better conceptualise such ‘urban green communities’, as we call them, this chapter synthesises three main approaches found in the literature. These approaches deal with attachments to one’s neighbourhood or place of residence, how volunteers are enrolled into neo-liberal governance, and imagined communities of civic solidarity. We illustrate these senses of community by drawing on the empirical case of a transition town-affiliated civic gardening initiative in a mid-sized Danish city. In particular, we show how pragmatic sociologist Laurent Thévenot’s notion of ‘commonality in the plural’ and his distinction of familiar, planned, and justifiable engagements, allow us to bring together these otherwise divergent senses of community into a comprehensive analytical framework. Drawing on the empirical case, we argue that Thévenot’s framework provides an empirically sensitive grasp on how groups compose their civic practices vis-à-vis urban-environmental issues as one key component in collective aspirations for more sustainable cities. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff, Quentin Gausset and Simon Lex; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078625087

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative multiple case study examining the role of diaspora embeddedness, extended family, ethno-religious-, cultural- and social ties and relevant structures shaping diaspora entrepreneurship. Findings: The authors found that social ties and diaspora embeddedness create dynamism fostering entrepreneurial identity as a part of the Bukharian culture, and as a preferred career option in the context of Bukharian Jews in diaspora. Diasporic family businesses are products of culture and tradition that migrate to new locations with families and communities, not as disconnected business entities. Research limitations/implications: The ways in which families nurture a highly entrepreneurial culture that transfers across generations and contexts are context-specific and not per se generalizable to other diasporas. Practical implications: Diasporans often continue their traditions and become again entrepreneurs after their settlement, or they may generate hybrid, circular solutions that allow them to employ their competences in the new contexts or connecting various contexts. This calls for transnational entrepreneurship-policymaking. Social implications: Time changes diasporas. A long-term commitment to the business environment evolves and reduces the mobility of the individual diasporan; typically the children of these migrants become more integrated and develop divergent career paths. Hence, their plans are not necessarily including family entrepreneurship creating a challenge for continuation of the original culture of entrepreneurship. Originality/value: Despite a notable tradition in Jewish studies, there is limited research on Jewish entrepreneurial diaspora and its contemporary entrepreneurial identity and tradition. Furthermore, the population of Bukharian Jews is an unknown and under-explored highly entrepreneurial group that may offer instrumental views to larger diasporic audiences being concerned about maintaining notions of ethnic heritage and identity. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bukharian Jews; Diaspora; Diaspora entrepreneurship; Embeddedness; Entrepreneurial culture; Family business",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078288265

Whiteboards as communication platforms are integrated with daily stand-up meetings. The purpose of this paper is a comparative study between analogue and digital approaches with the hypothesis that continued use of analogue LEAN boards leads to (excessive) waste occurrence compared to going digital. This paper is based on two qualitative, interpretivist case studies of manufacturing organisations. Data include styles of management data visualisations, observations of LEAN board meetings, and process analysis of data management. The communication processes as a core activity of the SFM are studied from a lens of value stream mapping (VSM) for communication and also management style and impact. Key findings are that waste occurs when staying loyal to analogue LEAN boards, as several of the processes can be limited or even eliminated by rightfully utilising digital LEAN boards. Given the higher effectiveness of digital approaches, this paper concludes that the dogma of continuous use of analogue LEAN boards must be discussed as a key factor in modernising LEAN SFM and the outreach to the employees involved. This paper's originality comes from LEAN-based SFM as increasingly founded around daily stand-ups and styles of LEAN boards, alongside industrial megatrends of digitisation. This paper adds to the discussion of approaches for optimal SFM and the relationship among communication media, management paradigm, and LEAN waste factors. The case companies are at different levels of maturity of LEAN; however, the fundamental management philosophy is the same and largely points to the same results. When it comes to digital LEAN boards, this paper suggests opportunities to reduce waste and have a transparent knowledge base, decision-making foundation, and conscious organisation of operational management. © 15th European Conference on Management, Leadership and Governance, ECMLG 2019.

The economic assessment shows that the basic alternative, i.e., anaerobic digestion with methane selling to the grid, generates 19 USD/t_VS (3 USD/t_foodwaste) of profit. The highest profit is obtained by dark fermentation with separation and purification of acetic and butyric acids, i.e., 296 USD/t_VS (47 USD/t_foodwaste). The only alternative that presented losses is the power generation alternative, needing tipping fees and/or subsidy of 176 USD/t_VS (29 USD/t_foodwaste). The rest of the alternatives generate profit. From the return on investment (ROI) and payback time, the best scenario is the production of polylactic acid, with 98% ROI and 7.8 years payback time.

The paper investigates the meaning of boundary objects. It is a conceptual paper with an empirical example. The empirical example is from a Danish (global) supplier engaged in a development project with technical aid (tools) in mounting and assembling gypsum walls. The example demonstrates how the use of boundary objects help the supplier to gain an understanding of different professional practices and aid the transformation to utilise smarter tools. The concept of boundary objects enables an understanding of the epistemological difference inherent in the process of collaboration and research between the university and the wider construction industry. Boundary objects can be used to improve present technical understanding and further its implementation, which is a valuable function for applied research institutions depending on collaboration from a broad range of stakeholder groups. A three-step phase model is suggested for the use of boundary objects to develop and improve present and new practices and technologies. © 2019 Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM 2019 - Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference.

In consequence, the industry dedicates considerable resources on fighting day-To-day issues instead of embracing a more cross-organizational approach of Construction Supply Chain Management (CSCM). In this paper, we examine the attempts of one of Scandinavia's major contractor groups to achieve CSCM integration and align cross-organizational practices of the supply chain. We present a case study of two subsidiaries in the group using data from observations, surveys and interviews. Drawing on Neoinstitutional theory with emphasis on the concepts of coupling and decoupling, we examine the interplay between institutional pressure and organizational responses. In our discussion, we argue that the coordination of the supply chain is decoupled from the strategic level through its constricted focus on the performance of specific projects. We then go on to illustrate how the company's efforts centre on assuming a role as CSCM integrator by involving key stakeholders of the supply chain to recouple weak links between decision-making and organizational practices. In conclusion, we argue that the company attempts to achieve CSCM integration by generating market-legitimacy. However, the constant creation of new project organizations, the existence of decentralized supply networks as well as informal authority of project managers to select or deselect procurement policies leads to various types of organizational decoupling. Accordingly, there exists a competing environment of conflicting demands and divergent incentive structures, which is an on-going challenge for the necessary alignment of cross-organizational CSCM integration. © 2019 Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM 2019 - Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference.

The bioeconomy is an emerging area for research, policy and economic activity and there are many views on it. Our focus is on the role of innovation in waste valorisation, including technological as well as social and institutional innovation. We discuss the waste pyramid that illustrates the hierarchy of alternative forms of waste management in terms of resource efficiency and sustainability, and the associated notion of the cascading use of biological resources. We conceptualise the different forms of waste management as “integrated socio-technical systems of production and consumption”. This concept brings into play the body of literature on socio-technical transitions, innovation and governance that is central for analysing the patterns and dynamics of waste valorisation. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Antje Klitkou, Arne Martin Fevolden and Marco Capasso.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077005552

In the brewing industry, the large quantities of spent grain produced during the brewing process have spurred interest in developing various valorisation pathways as an alternative to the traditional use of spent grain as animal feed. Spent grain has a high protein content and other nutritional assets, as well as potential as a feedstock in various industries, including food and nutrition, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and biofuels. However, company decisions on how to manage organic residues not only reflect the technical possibilities, but are also influenced by the economic supply chain and regulatory aspects, as well as corporate social responsibility policies and initiatives. In view of this, this chapter investigates the use of organic residues in brewing value chains with a focus on spent grain, and identifies the factors determining existing and alternative management options for this residue.

Simultaneously, the industry faces increasingly large ecological challenges with the grow-out phase at sea. As a result, and with the aid of Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS) technology, firms are moving more of the production processes onto land. Thus far, the industry has treated the waste (sludge from the land-based farms) as a low-value product, and valorisation has been a low priority. Handling of waste is primarily driven by the need to meet regulations, and applications for the waste have been slow to develop. However, as the scale of land-based aquaculture increases, the volumes of organic waste are expected to grow proportionally. This will require innovation to develop new pathways to handle this increased volume of waste for this industry in order to become more sustainable. In this chapter, we explore the possibilities for sustainable pathways for increased valorisation of organic waste from the aquaculture salmon industry in Norway and Denmark from a socio-technical transition perspective. Through interviews with fish producers and technology providers, we explore the barriers for development, key drivers for innovation and potential areas for new value chains and networks that may emerge within this industry. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Antje Klitkou, Arne Martin Fevolden and Marco Capasso.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076988993

Theoretical underpinnings such as lock-in mechanisms, value chain governance and directionality through industrial practices are used to understand how differences in company strategies and capabilities affect the utilisation of side streams from cheese and yoghurt production. We examine factors at the level of the firm, the industry and the market, which influence whey valorisation in the two countries. We find that the organisation of the dairy companies, such as the separation of main products and by-product processing into different legal units, affects capabilities and the utilisation of whey, as well as their abilities to exploit economies of scale and scope in raw material sourcing, production and marketing. These factors, together with the national economic and political context, place the two dairies in very different positions in the global value chain for whey-based products. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Antje Klitkou, Arne Martin Fevolden and Marco Capasso.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076962336

We argue that this is partly because “diversity” is multifaceted, representing different sources (e.g., demographic, human capital, and social capital) and operating at different levels of analysis. We propose a theoretical model of diversity at the team level (team diversity) and within individuals (personal range) to predict how various sources of diversity influence team effectiveness. We argue that the effects of individual-level diversity (personal range) and team-level diversity may not be independent. Specifically, we propose that their interaction may be the missing link explaining how and why diversity impacts team outcomes. We distinguish between tasks with high and low levels of interdependence and suggest that for some sources of diversity, individual- and team-level diversity are complementary, whereas for others they are substitutes. We further explain how an overlap in personal range may influence the complementary effects of personal range and team diversity. The implications of our model are important for further work on diversity, team effectiveness, and public policy efforts to promote organizational and upper echelons diversity. © Academy of Management Review.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076750439

The five areas of similarity are the rhetorical roots, use of framing, preaching to the choir, negative affect from crises, and scandals. Each similarity is explored, then differences are identified.

While the hopes seem high, existing research has not provided empirical research that justifies these hopes. Apparently succeeding with these approaches are harder than originally expected. This research attempts to increase our understanding of why this is the case by identifying the challenges that these approaches face. This is done through a systematic literature review. The research identifies a broad range of challenges related to: public sector characteristics, the implementation of open innovation, and the execution of open innovation projects. The research also identifies areas where we lack a proper understanding of the challenges. The primary area, where more knowledge is needed, is how to implement, and realize value from solutions that changes both citizen behavior, public sector organizations, infrastructure and even private sector organizations. © The Authors, 2019.

Recent years have, however, shown that transparency is challenged, and public debate has exploded. The focus has in many ways been on a lack of transparency, but the public debate has been muddled by a lack of clarity on what the term means. This paper identifies four different aspects of transparency when it comes to digital government. This is transparency of algorithms, and of data, as well as of the decision processes when digitalization and development are initiated. The latter can be divided into transparency of administrative decisions, and of democratic debate. The democratic transparency has been sorely lacking in Denmark leading to a significant democratic deficit in digital government. This is due to very low transparency when decisions on digitization measures are presented for the democratic elected representatives. The latter in particular calls for more research, since lack of democratic transparency poses a danger to the stability of democratic societies. © The Authors, 2019.

We conclude that nonstandard employment has remained rather stable in all four countries over time. However, although nonstandard employment seems to be largely integrated in the Nordic labor markets, it still entails precarious elements in certain countries in particular. Norway and Denmark stand out as having less insecure labor markets, while Finland and Sweden have more precariousness associated with nonstandard employment. We argue that these differences are explained by differences in the institutional contexts in the countries. © 2019.

Building on this, recent concepts (e.g., Third Mission) discuss the role and value of different dissemination mechanisms for increasing societal impact. However, the value individual scientists receive in exchange for disseminating knowledge differs across these mechanisms, which, consequently, affects their selection. So far, value capture mechanisms have mainly been described as appropriating monetary rewards in exchange for scientists' knowledge (e.g., patenting). However, most knowledge dissemination activities in science do not directly result in capturing monetary value (e.g., social engagement). By taking a value capture perspective, this article conceptualizes and explores how individual scientists capture value from disseminating their knowledge. Results from our qualitative study indicate that scientists' value capture consists of a measureable objective part (e.g., career promotion) and a still unconsidered subjective part (e.g., social recognition), which is perceived as valuable due to scientists' needs. By advancing our understanding of value capture in science, scientists' selection of dissemination mechanisms can be incentivized to increase both the value captured by themselves and society. Hence, policy makers and university managers can contribute to overcoming institutional and ecosystem barriers and foster scientists' engagement with society. © 2019 by the authors.","Open innovation in science; Open science; Scientific knowledge production; Societal impact; Subjective exchange value; Value capture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074191874

Our key interest in the article is the potential offered by experimental participatory events to support the biodiverse transformation of public areas by creating micro-utopian entanglements of citizens and nonhuman organisms. The article will focus on three experimental participatory events enacted as part of the research project: (1) public dialogues and workshops, (2) the arrival on the scene of charismatic cows, and (3) pop-up events in the form of participatory playing. The article concludes that this kind of material citizenship is a powerful strategy for stimulating public engagement in building more biodiverse futures. The strategy thus materializes micro-utopian spaces where the importance of biodiversity can be rehearsed and sensed by local communities.

What are the factors conditioning employers’ age stereotypes? To what extent are ageist attitudes among employers translated into discriminatory recruitment, retention and firing practices? And what factors can moderate the stereotype–discrimination interaction? Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on a survey conducted among Danish employers; 2,525 completed the survey questionnaires; response rate 25 per cent. Findings: The major finding is that ageist stereotypes among employers do not translate into discriminatory personnel management practices. Research limitations/implications: The findings may be specific to Denmark. Denmark is renowned to be a non-hierarchical, egalitarian society, which may have implications for personnel management practices. Originality/value: Contrary to this study, most studies analysing ageist stereotypes do not assess the extent to which stereotypes are translated into discriminatory personnel management practices in the workplace. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ageism; Company performance; Denmark; Discrimination; Older workers",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073951833

Foreign direct investment has played an important role in the growth of the apparel export industry, but there exist also locally owned export firms. Sector-specific industrial policies are divided into three phases: incentivizing local investment in apparel exporting; addressing constraints facing local export firms and attracting foreign direct investment; and promoting foreign and local investment within specialized industrial parks.

Moreover, barriers such as large and inflexible machinery, long setup time, and resource complexity, has limited the implementation and impact of lean practices in process industries in general. Contrary to the expectations in the literature, we bring in this paper a successful experience of lean implementation in a company of the food-processing sector. By focusing on two lean tools (VSM and SMED), the company reduced changeover time by 34%, and increased the production capacity of the main production line by 11%. This improvement enabled the company to avoid the use of temporary workers by extending the worktime of its workforce during peak months. Moreover, the reduction of setup time avoided the use of large lot size in production, which, in turn, reduced the total cycle time of production and the incidence of quality problems. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.

These changes oblige media companies to engage in entrepreneurial learning dealing with existing and potential opportunities of the market for surviving and growing. Despite the acknowledged importance of entrepreneurial learning, research explicitly addressing the question of what organisation learns entrepreneurially is still in poor supply. Using grounded theory method and drawing on five in-depth case studies of Danish media companies involved in innovative services, this study addresses the aspects of entrepreneurial learning and develops a model that suggests three dimensions of entrepreneurial learning named learning opportunity recognition, learning opportunity discovery and learning opportunity creation.

Departing from the perspective of structuration theory, we propose that cognitive processes enable agents to act within structures. Cognition is dependent on institutional configurations which range from stable to fast moving and dynamic. It is argued that the degree of the agents' embeddedness affects the cognition of the agent, which, in turn, enables the agents' abilities to act upon and influence structures in the understanding of structuration theory. Through this mechanism, context emerges. A case study to depict the way a firm engages in cross-border activities and navigates within different institutional environments is presented.

The analysis compares the two countries’ sectoral innovation systems for meat processing and handling of ABPs by focusing on the constituting parts of an innovation system: actors, networks, institutions, knowledge and technologies. In particular, the chapter emphasises the role of regulations in shaping input and demand and thereby the value creation dynamics of the industry. Moreover, we find that the large differences in terms of geographical and industrial structures, size and volume of ABPs likewise condition value creation processes differently in the two systems. In sum, the chapter confirms that the co-evolutionary development of the ABP industry is conditioned by place-specific factors such as industrial structure, size and geography as well as institutional settings that influence actors’ search for value creation and market opportunities. The chapter contributes to a better understanding of how market opportunities co-evolve with institutional and structural conditions given by the sectoral and national innovation systems. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Antje Klitkou, Arne Martin Fevolden and Marco Capasso.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072630043

However, our review of papers in the two leading IS journals from 2000 to 2016 suggests that IS research has lost sight of the discipline’s sociotechnical character—a character that was widely acknowledged at the discipline’s inception. This is a problem because an axis of cohesion can be fundamental to a discipline’s long-term vitality. In order to address this issue, we offer ways to renew the sociotechnical perspective so that it can continue to serve as a distinctive and coherent foundation for the discipline. Our hope is that the renewed sociotechnical frame for the IS discipline discussed in the paper holds potential to contribute to the enduring strength of our diverse, distinctive, yet unified discipline. It also prompts members of the discipline to think more deeply about what it means to be an IS scholar. © 2019 University of Minnesota.

While this freedom is optimal for in-layer communication, it puzzles cross-layer integration due to incompatibilities among standards. Also enforcing a unique communication stack within the same IoT platform is not a solution, as it leads to the current phenomenon of “IoT islands”, where disparate platforms hardly interact with each other. In this paper we tackle the problem of IoT cross-layer and cross-platform integration following a language-based approach. We build on the Jolie programming language, which provides uniform linguistic abstractions to exploit heterogeneous communication stacks, allowing the programmer to specify in a declarative way the desired stack, and to easily change it, even at runtime. Jolie currently supports the main technologies from Service-Oriented Computing, such as TCP/IP, Bluetooth, and RMI at transport level, and HTTP and SOAP at application level. We integrate in Jolie the two most adopted protocols for IoT communication, i.e., CoAP and MQTT. We report our experience on a case study on Cloud-based home automation, and we present high-level concepts valuable both for the general implementation of interoperable systems and for the development of other language-based solutions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Abstracting; Distributed computer systems; High level languages; HTTP; Interoperability; Linguistics; Software design; Wearable technology; Application level; Communication stacks; Communication standards; Heterogeneous communication; Home automation; Internet of thing (IOT); Interoperable systems; Service oriented computing; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071931952

Different ontological and epistemological framings, and associated language games have contributed to a fragmented body of knowledge. In this paper, we argue that the new term ‘co-creation’ is part of this language game, and efforts to date have not linked co-creation to the broader and deeper currents of theory building that have come before. We thus place co-creation within its wider context by, firstly, building a meta-narrative review of the literature that draws together a number of disparate disciplinary-inspired lines of thinking, and secondly, by identifying and extending key concepts of co-creation and its logics to tourism. We trace seven threads of scholarship that demonstrate the ideas and values associated with co-creation have diverse historical roots. Using a meta-narrative approach, we unpack the characteristics of co-creation from different disciplinary lenses, directing attention to issues beyond service-dominant logic approaches towards wider issues of participation, inclusion, power, responsibility, and value. In the process, we contribute to a new and fresh appreciation of value co-creation in tourism literature, along with a nine-point agenda that suggest directions for future research and practice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Co-creation; collaborative; meta-narrative; relational work; value",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071053965

Utilisation of mass customization as a strategy has achieved results in the manufacturing industry in terms of increasing productivity and competitiveness, so the strategy might have potentials in the building and construction industry as well. However, mass customization as a strategy for improving the productivity of the building and construction industry has not been explored as much as in the manufacturing industry. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the assumptions and possibilities for applying the principles of mass customisation related to establishing an adaptable integrated system of entities in the value chain of the building and construction industry. The outset of the paper is a literature review concerning the utilisation of mass customization as a strategy in terms of increasing productivity within the building and construction industry. An essential part of the paper is a case study of 11 building and construction companies and an analysis of the conditions for cooperation between the entities in the value chain of the building and construction industry.

Which organizational features explain differences in discrimination is largely unknown. This article proposes that organizational performance relates to an organization's likelihood of engaging in employment discrimination and argues that poor-performing organizations tend to be less open to new ideas and that decision makers in such organizations are more prone to stereotyping behavior. The study combines a field experiment in which applications were sent to real job vacancies in 71 Danish public schools with administrative data on the schools.

As developing countries continue to struggle to identify new and innovative ways of growing their economies and capacity building, attention is increasingly being turned to the potential role of their diasporas in these processes. Of note here is the added attention being given to remittancing. This is with good reason, given that for countries such as Jamaica and Haiti, remitted funds represent more than development assistance and in some cases represent the highest source of foreign exchange earnings. Most importantly, diaspora members can contribute to a great extent to capacity building in their home countries through their remittances. This chapter analyses how Caribbean and Central Asia diaspora members can contribute to capacity building in their home countries. The chapter argues for a more nuanced and expanded view of remittancing. That is, one which sees remittancing as more than the sending of money directly to families. Other forms of remittancing included here are the skills and knowledge acquired in the country of residence, which can be brought back to the country of origin, to help grow its capacity to respond to ongoing developmental challenges. The chapter suggests various ways in which remitted funds can be used for capacity building. The chapter contributes to diversifying views on remittancing and its uses, as well as its role as a capacity building tool. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069789721

We start by conceptualising communities as communities of place (CofP), directly impacted by mining activities but have few resources, and communities of interest (CofI), as outsiders with an interest in mining projects and the resources to create uncertainty about the mine. We argue that community risk is a precursor to financial, political and cultural risks and that both CofP and CofI can expose the mining MNE to risks, either individually or in unison. We find that mining MNEs focus on mitigating community risks in the initial phases of the mine project, when the impact on the CofP is perceived to be lowest. Our interpretation is that the objective of the risk management practice is to commit resources to CofP for as long as there is a possibility that they will form partnerships with CofI. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Armenia; CofI; CofP; Communities of interest; Communities of place; Community risk; Liability of outsidership; Mining MNE; Risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069543857

In Iran, extent and opportunities were limited by severe sanctions until 2015, when sanctions were eased by what is known as the nuclear agreement. This institutional change invites the hypothesis that easing sanctions entailed an expansion of entrepreneurship. This hypothesis is tested as a natural experiment, comparing entrepreneurial pursuits before and after the agreement, using the annual survey of adults and entrepreneurs in Iran conducted by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, complemented by in-depth interviews. Pre-and post-survey comparisons show increases in people's opportunity perceptions, intention to become entrepreneurs, and entry into entrepreneurship.

Traffic scheduling and shaping in TSN aim to achieve bounded low latency and zero congestion loss. However, the most widespread solution (i.e. Time-Aware Shaper) requires a networkwide precision clock reference and only targets on cyclical traffic flows. This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of the ATS, which applies shaping algorithm to any flows and requires no clock reference. Simulations are proposed for evaluation and comparison. Metrics including end-to-end delay, buffer usage and frame loss rate are collected to assess the shaping performance. Results show that ATS achieves effective traffic shaping and switching without synchronous mechanisms, while there is an evident trade-off for using these specific algorithms. © 2019 ASTES Publishers.

The role of ICTs as (dis)organizing devices in this context is studied using a communicative approach and an ethnographic methodology. The chapter indicates that ICTs create the paradox of (in)visibility: 1) visibility creates order and enables coordination but has negative consequences because it is conducive of data aggregation, monitoring and preemptive policing that serve to obstruct individuals from collective action; and 2) invisibility facilitates coordination because encryption, concealment and obfuscation allow individuals to organize, but at the same time leads to disorder through ellipsis, exclusion and silencing. The findings show that ICTs are powerful surveillance devices that operate on different time-space infrastructures and are appropriated by other actors for managing (in)visibilities across different sites.

While abundant research has investigated motives for participation, little research so far has addressed the reasons why users choose not to participate. We suggest that some potential solvers may refrain from participation from the outset on account of their personality dispositions. In our study, we complement existing knowledge about user motivation to engage in co-creation with findings from personality research.

Most previous studies have used fictitious brands to test the aforementioned effect, raising concerns about the degree to which these findings are relevant for marketing practice. Brand managers thus might wonder whether labelling product innovations as user-designed and/or user-selected might indeed increase sales for their well-established brands. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating the possible effects of three alternative strategies for labelling innovations (i.e., empowerment-to-select, empowerment-to-create, and full empowerment) for two well-established technology brands. For all three strategies and both brands, we find that involving customers significantly increases the perceived innovation ability, which then positively mediates the effect on behavioural intentions. However, due to a negative direct effect, only labelling products as selected by customers has an overall positive effect. © 2019 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.

Luhmann conceptualizes organizational phenomena as interconnected communicative events of ordering (i.e., fixing contingencies through decisions) and disordering (i.e., the inevitable opening up of new contingencies through decisions). We showcase the value of the Luhmannian perspective by employing it to study the phenomenon of project-based organizations (PBOs) in which the interplay of ordering and disordering is particularly precarious. Through a comparative analysis of two PBOs (one from film production, one from IT consulting), we show that the interconnectivity of communicative events tends to be continuously disrupted in PBOs on the cross-project level. Accordingly, from a Luhmannian viewpoint, the PBO itself can be understood as a rather rudimentary organizational phenomenon that tends to “outlive�? its own projects which, in turn, remain environmental to the PBO. These theoretical insights bring forth implications for cross-project learning as well as for our understanding of PBOs as an organizational form. While PBOs are often celebrated as an extremely flexible form of organizing, they also exhibit high degrees of inflexibility, that is, a tendency of ordering without disordering. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068051890

Using a survey of the Adult Fans of Lego (AFOL) community, we found that brand community members’ willingness to share their ideas is positively related to the ahead of the trend (AT) dimension of lead user characteristics, brand community identification and brand loyalty. Interference by the company in community activities also plays a role.

The aim of this study is to identify the characteristics of information sharing, and conceptualize how to move from information sharing to information utilization in food supply chains. Using a case study methodology together with a review of the existing literature the authors describe the main facets of shared information - which influence the information utilization in a supply chain - and propose a mapping notation for how these facets can be visualized together with a supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model. Information utilization is especially important because more information sharing does not necessarily result in a better supply chain performance unless the shared information is effectively used in the relevant processes in the chain and well-aligned with the requirements for those processes. The proposed notation provides a systematic structure for mapping the information flows, their specific facets, and helps clarify what information is available and how this information can be utilized in different supply chain processes. Four facets of information sharing are identified and elaborated for food supply chains, together with a mapping tool that emphasizes the information flows and the utilization of information in supply chains.

In particular, it is concluded that despite the economic differences of different cryptocurrencies, they generally fall outside the scope of Danish and Swedish lex specialis regulation on taxation of capital gains and losses from the sale of certain assets, for example, shares and claims in currency. In both countries, there appears to be a presumption that most cryptocurrencies should be taxed as assets held for investment and speculative purposes. It is argued that such an approach is problematic not only in relation to the principle of neutrality, but also because it creates a barrier to realizing the economic potential of cryptocurrencies. The authors conclude that (1) the classification of cryptocurrencies poses challenges and uncertainty for tax purposes due to the lack of a regulatory framework, the absence of common definitions and the diverse technical structure of tokens and coins and (2) the classification for Danish and Swedish tax law purposes should be based on a case-by-case assessment of the specific cryptocurrency. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066951040

It theorizes that the role of umbrellas goes beyond signaling a large individual membership or constituency of people, but that umbrellas are distinct in transmitting interests from other organizations. This function is expected to be valuable in exchanges with legislators who seek efficiency, input legitimacy, and policy implementation, but less valuable in the media arena. Using a new data set on lobbying by 286 groups on 12 issues in the United Kingdom and Germany, the article serves support for this theory: Umbrellas enjoy higher legislative access, but lower media access than groups without member organizations, irrespective of their individual membership or claimed constituency.

Despite this, there exists very little scientific research on the transformation process, as well as on the challenges and success factors of using SAFe in large-scale organizations. To start filling in this research gap, we conducted a case study by investigating the formation of agile release trains and the related challenges in a large financial organization adopting SAFe. We conducted 24 interviews with 27 interviewees, after which we analyzed the transcribed interviews using open and axial coding. The SAFe transformation started by forming a pilot train with teams that already had experience in agile practices. The success of the pilot led to the launching of new release trains. The forming of new agile release trains was challenging due to politics, difficulties in identifying the value streams, and the avoidance of a radical restructuring of the organization. These challenges led to opting for an organic way of transformation. Management organized several workshops to identify stakeholders for the second train. This was followed by team members choosing their teams based on skills and interests. The last two trains were formed using Lego workshops. The most significant challenges after forming the release trains at the case organization were struggles with existing projects and challenges due to inter-train dependencies. © The Author(s) 2019.","Agile release trains; Challenges; SAFe; Scaled agile framework","Data processing; Challenges; Financial organizations; Radical restructuring; Release trains; SAFe; Scaled agile framework; Scientific researches; Transformation process; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065888198

Youths in the 15–24 age group frequently make up the largest share of the unemployed; each successive year, the “demographic youth bulge” causes the number of youths entering the labour market to be larger than the preceding year; a bloated public sector that is unable to create more jobs; private sector economies that range from dormant to nascent; and public coffers that are largely insufficient to change the youth unemployment dynamic. The youth unemployment dynamic across MENA is frequently singled out as a cause of Arab Spring. Although MENA is often referred to as a single region, there are roughly three blocks of Arab countries with characteristics more in common with one another than with the region in general. The wealthy Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries form one similar bloc. War-torn countries (e.g. Syria, Yemen, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea/Djibouti, Somalia) form another bloc. Despite some geographic, economic and/or cultural differences, the remaining countries of the third bloc (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia) share more similarities than differences. The authors selected the three most similar countries from the third bloc—Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia—to study more carefully. Two of the three are very similar, although one is from the Middle East (Jordan) and the other is from North Africa (Morocco). Both of these countries share more similarities than most of the others in the “third bloc”: Both are ruled by young, dynamic and popular constitutional monarchs. In fact, the enormous popularity of both King Mohammed VI and King Abdullah II sets a high standard for any risk from potential electable rivals. Despite the similarities of both of these monarchs, their fathers ruled very differently. Both countries began as protectorates of European powers: France in the case of Morocco and Great Britain in the case of Jordan. King Hassan II (Mohammed VI’s father) ruled, while Morocco was still a French protectorate. He was considerably less enthusiastic about public education than his counterpart, King Hussein of Jordan. These characteristics still affect both countries today; Morocco has lower rates of literacy (69.4%), and Jordan (97.9%) has one of the highest rates compared with world rates [85.4% (Additionally, Tunisia’s rate: 80.2%. All literacy rates from UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2012)]. Under King Hassan II and King Hussein, both countries were members of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). But Morocco was in the “Russian camp” and Jordan was in the “American camp”. As with decisions concerning public education, decisions implemented during the early NAM days continue to impact both countries today. Although Jordan and Morocco share similarities, Tunisia stands out as an anomaly in MENA (Noted most clearly in Tunisia, an Arab Anomaly by Dr. Safwan Masri 2017. The authors are extremely grateful to Dr. Masri for his generosity, kindness and patience in assisting them in using Tunisia as a standard of achievement for comparison with Jordan and Morocco.). Some of the most significant factors that make Tunisia different began in the early nineteenth century. Not only was Tunisia’s path to nationhood and development early; it was unusual in that education propelled its trajectory. While Tunisia’s Arab Spring uprising is frequently cited as a potential model for change across the Arab region, the authors argue that the uprising was a perturbation, a consequence of national leaders deviating from Tunisia’s long and successful upward trajectory. Using both comparative analysis and discourse analysis, the authors identify factors/policies/characteristics that influence the positive development of innovation and entrepreneurship, youth employment and stability in three of MENAs most promising countries. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Entrepreneurs/innovation; ILO; IMF; Islamic education/Western education in MENA; Muslim Brotherhood; Public–private partnerships (PPPs)/PIMA; Rentier/semi-rentier state; Tunisia/Morocco/Jordan; World Bank; Youth employment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065338614

An understanding of this may provide greater insight into the interventions a university should be making if it hopes to improve retention of its expatriate academics. By analysing qualitative responses to a written questionnaire, this paper explores the perceptions of organisational support held by 163 expatriate academics employed at a large international Danish university, and compares these perceptions with the support the university claims to offer. Our study reveals that, in the case of expatriate academics, even extensive offerings of organisational support can be insufficient if the existence and specific benefits of the support are not adequately communicated, and if the academics do not trust the source of the support on offer.

In this work, the authors attempt to unveil whether the efforts that an e-marketplace has made are associated with the continuance of its SME clients. To answer this research question, a set of data from a B2B e-marketplace connecting qualified SMEs with overseas buyers was used for analysis, and they discovered three results. First, generating many online leads is negatively associated with SMEs’ continuance with such an e-marketplace company. Second, organizing many online videoconferencing meetings between SMEs and buyers can promote this tendency, which is different from organizing many offline meetings. Third, onsite visits that e-marketplace salespersons make can attenuate the negative effect of the generation of online leads.

Investigating seven cases (micro, small, and medium enterprises) of Bangladeshi diasporans’ in Denmark, our study presents an in-depth understanding of the impact of dual institutional characteristics, whereby the relatively higher importance of COR institutional features shape diaspora entrepreneurial motivation and management. Motivation and management styles vary due to the length of a diaspora’s stay in the COR, their educational background, relevant previous experience, and degree of social integration in the COR. Some important personality traits, which are shaped by dual institutional features, determine the degree to which diaspora can develop cultural intelligence and social capital in the COR context. This helps the diaspora develop suitable entrepreneurial capabilities to grow the venture, while the personality traits and social capital derive from the diasporans’ educational background and involvement in sports and social activities in the Danish context. This study postulates four broad categories of motivational factors, namely (a) income security and financial success, (b) social recognition and status, (c) work achievement, and (d) independence and autonomy of work, which manifest different types of entrepreneurship depending on the diaspora’s personal background and the nature of the Danish (COR) institutional features. We find a mixed influence of COO and COR institutions on various features of management. Finally, we develop an analytical model, called the ‘House Model’, to explain diasporas’ venture creation and venture management processes in an institutionally distant context and argue that researchers should take into account both the COO’s and COR’s institutional features when examining the growth and survival of diaspora entrepreneurship.

The decision of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in April 2018 to adopt an Initial Strategy so as to achieve by 2050 a reduction of at least 50% in maritime greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions vis-à-vis 2008 levels epitomizes the last among a series of recent developments as regards sustainable shipping. It also sets the scene on what may happen in the future. Even though many experts and industry circles believe that the IMO decision is in line with the COP21 climate change agreement in Paris in 2015, others disagree, either on the ground that the target is not ambitious enough, or on the ground that no clear pathway to reach the target is currently visible. This book takes a cross-disciplinary view of the various dimensions of the maritime transportation sustainability problem. “Cross-disciplinary” means that a variety of angles are used to examine the book topics, and these mainly include the technological angle, the economics angle, the logistics angle, and the environmental angle. The book reviews models that can be used to evaluate decisions, policy alternatives and tradeoffs. For sustainable shipping, a spectrum of technical, logistics-based and market based measures are being contemplated. All may have important side-effects as regards the economics and logistics of the maritime supply chain, including ports and hinterland connections. The objective to attain an acceptable environmental performance, while at the same time respecting traditional economic performance criteria so that shipping remains viable, is and is likely to be a central goal for both industry and policy-makers in the years ahead. At the same time, policy fragmentation is likely to create distortions of competition and sub-optimal solutions. This book attempts to address these issues and identify better solutions. Sustainable Shipping: A Cross-Disciplinary Viewincludes chapters that cover many relevant topics. These include a general view of maritime transport sustainability, green ship technologies, information and communication technologies (ICTs) for sustainable shipping, green tramp ship routing and scheduling, green liner network design and speed optimization.

After content-analysing archive data, we estimated a vector-generalised linear model with binomial response distributions and probit link functions; with network composition as the predictor and the innovation process charateristics and outcomes as response variables. Our findings show that differently composed manufacturer networks lead to different outcomes and different process characteristics.

When transaction cost risks are particularly strong, a common prescription is to avoid contracting altogether or, if it is unavoidable, to spend additional resources on contract management activities. This article presents evidence on the size and variability of governments' ex ante transaction cost spending, using original data from 72 contracts issued by 47 Danish local governments. Ex ante transaction costs average 2.7 percent per contract and are relatively higher when services are more complex and lower when governments have prior contracting experience and contracts were larger. The analyses suggest the importance of distinguishing between transaction cost attributes and governments' choices to spend resources in response to them.

We focus on three periods: The formative period (1890–1920), the confirmative period (1960–1980) and the challenging period (1997–2017). We conclude that the expectations for the manager’s role were initially defined by the needs and wishes of voluntary sports clubs (VSCs) and, further, that these expectations were stable throughout the two following periods. The management of CSFs has primarily been concerned with technical aspects such as budgeting, maintenance and cleaning, while the sporting activities in the CSFs have been the responsibility of the VSCs. Based on the analysis, we discuss how the managers of CSFs could handle current challenges such as an excess of available timeslots, cutbacks in subsidies and a maintenance backlog. We conclude that it is questionable whether the managers can provide the solutions to these, as their role seems to remain stable primarily due to a persistent pressure from VSCs to maintain the status quo for the role of the manager–i.e. that the manager should primarily focus on the need and wishes of the VSCs. Finally, we argue that if the aim is to make it possible for the manager to handle the challenges, the municipalities should consider to change the way municipalities allocate subsidies to CSFs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Community sports facilities; management; municipalities; sport for all; voluntary sports clubs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063721948

Consumers may embrace marketization, or they may resist it, try to escape it, rebel against it, or actively manage its effects. This chapter examines the marketization of elderly care (in the form of transactional service provider relationships) and how consumers apply humanizing strategies to market relationships. Methodology/Approach: This is a qualitative interpretive study using in-depth interviewing, observations, and the analysis of media coverage. Findings: Drawing on institutional theory, this study shows how consumers humanize a marketized service relationship by weaving social logics into existing market logics. Our research finds consumers engaging in three humanization strategies: (1) moving beyond transactional relationships; (2) sharing consumption experiences; and (3) reinforcing social bonds through giving. The end result is the do-it-yourself (DIY) creation of extended family relationships from market resources. Social Implications: The context of this study is a government-supported, non-profit, exchanged-based retirement support scheme that addresses the challenges of global population aging and the increasing anonymization and estrangement in our society. The authors tentatively suggest that our findings represent a move to mitigate adverse effects of neoliberalism. Originality/Value of the Paper: Prior research has shown that consumers embrace marketization, resist it, try to escape it, rebel against it, or actively manage its effects.

Methodology/Approach: Patriotism is approached as an appeal to patria and is considered as a socially constructed category. To explore the construction of patriotism, this research uses Michel Foucault’s concept of governmentality. In the market, the state, commercial companies, media, and consumers co-produce the dispositif of patriotism, which conducts the creative conduct of fashion designers and encourages them to follow patriotic fashion. At the same time, fashion designers have freedom to conduct themselves and act in different ways. Findings: Interpretations of patriotism within a patriotic dispositif are explored vis-à-vis the interpretations of patriotism articulated by fashion designers. In addition to patriotic fashion, the forms of their creative conduct or counter-conduct are manifested in such subtypes of patriotism in fashion as cosmopolitan patriotism, economic patriotism, cultural patriotism, and fashion localism. Research Limitations/Implications: The research is mainly limited to a perspective of fashion designers, and to some extent of the government, and does not consider the perspective of consumers. Originality/Value: The research develops a theoretical argument of patriotism as a tool of governmentality, juxtaposing it to the approach of patriotism as an ideology. This chapter also contributes to the studies of resistance, adding the perspective of cultural intermediaries contrary to the commonly studied perspective of consumers. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cultural intermediaries; Fashion designers; Foucault; Governmentality; Patriotism; Russia",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063580439

Researchers use various strategies in order to purify such hybrids into simplified representations of a fetishized imaginary, namely the average consumer. Methodology/approach: The chapter is based on an analysis of secondary sources such as company documents. Theoretically, it draws on the concept of consumption assemblages and on anthropological theories of fetish. Findings: Fetishization is a powerful way for both researchers and their clients to purify the hybrid assemblages they are part of into easily digestible categories such as “the real” and “the average.” In that process, the test town and its consumers emerge as a fetish that allows corporate clients to alleviate decision-making anxiety. Because of the nature of fetish, purification as a process remains incomplete. Research Implications: These findings call for more social studies of market research as a set of practices that shape the identities of those who do the testing and forecasting. This chapter thus opens up test marketing and so-called test towns in particular as a field for consumer culture theory research. Originality/value: This chapter provides insights into how market research creates test sites to simulate purchase behavior and pre-test consumer products. This chapter maps how different groups of actors and different technologies are enrolled in order to enact an ideal-type consumer averageness on an ongoing basis in a particular test town. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumption assemblage; Fetish; Purification; Simulation; Test markets",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063563751

We consider a vertically differentiated market in which consumer quality valuations are probabilistically and continuously distributed. We compare the results in such a setting with the most commonly used setting in the existing literature in which the products only have a single quality attribute and the market segments are represented by deterministic and discrete quality valuations. Our analysis includes two choices that are relevant when designing a product line. The first choice concerns the product line length, which is represented by the choice between the single-product strategy and the two-product strategy. The second choice concerns the distribution channel structure. The manufacturer can sell the products directly to end consumers in a centralized channel or through a retailer in a decentralized channel. We analyse and compare a number of performance measures such as profitability, consumer welfare and cannibalization intensity. Our results show that in case of a product with two conflicting attributes, the way in which the product line length and the distribution channel structure affect the performance measures mentioned above differs from the effects found when a product has a single quality attribute only. We also show that the continuously distributed quality valuations make the decision on whether to capture the market fully or partially highly relevant and important when making the quality-based segmentation decisions. © The authors 2017.

It is argued that the latter, measured by the notion of public value, is a relevant concept to consider in addition to social valuation defined here as a short-run concept. The Arctic Winter Games, a youth sports event, was used to shed light on these valuation concepts by showcasing how the event spurred a large range of outcomes. Based on fieldwork in the preparation phases of the event to identify relevant outcomes and using the contingent valuation method, it was found that the social value of the Games (although it was free to attend), estimated at US$10.5 million in the short run, outweighed the cost of US$9.4 million. Some suggestions for measuring the public value of sports events and a dynamic approach of sequentially refining the process of exploring and measuring long-lasting effects as they vanish or unfold is proposed. © 2019 Cognizant, LLC.","Arctic Winter Games; Contingent valuation; Public value; Social value; Willingness to pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063139577

This paper reviews the methodology and results, drawn from cases analyzed on two EU projects: EULASUR and EULACERMAT. The cases covers both European and Latin American experiences, particularly from Mercosur countries. We analyze specifically nanotechnology innovation based on new and advanced materials. The main conclusion of this paper is that innovation in advanced materials, based on nanotechnology, relies crucially on networks of cooperative agents. It starts from the validated assumption that innovation is interactive in nature. Therefore, it is needed to co-create through the participation to obtain feasible results. The position of advanced materials within the related (new or existent) value chains explains to a great extend the border conditions for innovating in this nanotechnology field. It appeared clearly that innovation in this field is a complex problem, with the same degree as researching (nanoscience), and that the connections between them were not obvious nor simple. Concerning policy implications, it is useful to discriminate them in terms of the temporal horizon of what type of nanotechnology innovation should be promoted, particularly for developing countries’ trajectories, for ensuring that the impacts of advanced materials will be suitable for the society. ©2019 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México","Advanced ceramics; Co-creation; Co-operative innovation; Nanotechnology innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063081193

Our findings show that at the aggregate level, brand loyalty declines, but this evolution is category-specific, with only a small number of categories showing a significant decline.

The article combines service innovation, practice, and experience economy theory. The analysis is based on a multiple qualitative service innovation field experiment in five Danish tourism companies. The experiments showed how front-line employees in tourism companies could act as creative experts in innovation processes that focused on developing new reflective encounter practices aimed at experiential value creation. However, the experiments also illustrated how a number of factors influenced the process, including a trust-based organizational environment, an organizational setup in which front-line employees' ideas could be developed and shared, organizational structures and mind-sets that supported front-line employees' reflective practice, as well as more specific ""rooms"" for creativity, such as facilitated workshops. Conversely, strong service mind-sets acted as a barrier to change towards experience-focused encounter practices. The article suggests new strategic approaches to innovation practices in tourism companies. Involving front-line employees in innovation processes becomes central for tourism companies that want to go beyond service production and create new experiential value. © 2019 Cognizant, LLC.","Encounters; Experience; Experiment; Innovation; Reflective practice; Tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062971902

The cognitive receiver is required to be able to evaluate the spectral environment properly so that it may not create additional interference to the primary users. The sensing accuracy and time are conflicting parameters, therefore, a trade-off is necessary for an optimal efficiency. We propose a dual-approach solution. The decision about the spectrum occupancy is made using the measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the received signal levels as inputs in a fuzzy logic algorithm. The result is then compared with the one acquired using the statistical method. Finally, an optimal balance between the sensing time and accuracy is obtained for the current environmental conditions using the derived closed form expression. The algorithm has been implemented using the USRP platform and GNU Radio. The analysis of the results shows the efficiency of our proposal.

The discussion focuses on different approaches to knowledge orchestration based on combinations of the use of interfirm objects and the characteristics of knowledge orchestration processes. To this end, a conceptual framework is applied to 11 case studies from Danish industries. The findings suggest that adopting a collaborative-oriented view of the use of interfirm objects facilitates orchestration of globally distributed knowledge in multinational companies. The findings also indicate that adoption of different knowledge orchestration approaches by companies can be influenced by headquarter–subsidiaries relationship, type of products, knowledge relevance between headquarter and subsidiaries, and level of headquarters' control over knowledge flow and subsidiaries' operation. Additionally, our findings propose that different approaches to knowledge orchestration can result in different degrees of innovation performance. This study extends existing literature on global knowledge management by focusing exclusively on knowledge orchestration in multinational companies. By introducing a dynamic view of the use of interfirm objects, facilitating collaboration between headquarters and subsidiaries, our findings would help multinational companies improve headquarter–subsidiaries relationship in favor of the efficiency and effectiveness of globally distributed network. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061606604

In this work, we propose and develop a decentralised exchange solution based on smart contracts running on the Ethereum network that is open, verifiable, and does not require trust. The platform enables two parties to trade different currencies, limited to Ethereum and Bitcoin in the current status of the system. A smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, functions as an escrow, which holds a user’s funds until a verified transaction has been made by the other party. To make the smart contract able to detect a Bitcoin transfer, we implement our solution by utilising an oracle.

In this paper, we present an algorithm to solve the Reachability problem for the declarative Condition Response (DCR) graphs notation: the problem, given a DCR graph and an activity, say “Payout reimbursement”, is to find a flow allowed by the graph that ends with the execution of that task. Existing brute-force solutions to this problem are generally unhelpful already at medium-sized graphs. Here we present a genetic algorithm solving Reachability. We evaluate this algorithm on a selection of DCR graphs, both artificial and from industry, and find that the genetic algorithm with one exception outperforms the best known brute-force solution on both whether a path is found and how quickly it is found. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","DCR; Declarative model; Genetic algorithm; Reachability","Enterprise resource management; Genetic algorithms; Problem solving; Brute force; Declarative models; Declarative process models; Flow based; Reachability; Reachability problem; Rule based; Set of rules; Flow graphs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061368837

In the second period, the DM evaluates the lottery outcomes on the basis of the objective probabilities but compares the received outcome with a level of anticipation formed in the first period. The DM will experience elation or disappointment when this outcome is above or below her or his level of anticipation, respectively. We provide an axiomatic framework for our model.

To capture such situations, we introduce the notion of ‘chronopathic experience’ and proceed to explore such experiences empirically among men incarcerated in Helsinki Prison.

However, less is known about how context influences the judgment of entrepreneurs. Focusing on the emerging judgment-based approach to entrepreneurship, we argue that economics can say much about how the organizational, market, and institutional context shapes entrepreneurial judgment. We describe entrepreneurs as individuals who deploy scarce, heterogeneous resources to service customer preferences at a profit. Because of uncertainty, this process is essentially experimental, and context influences the experimental process. Thus, entrepreneurs will seek to design the internal organization of the firm so that it facilitates internal experimentation. Moreover, the market or task environment determines the need for experimentation (e.g., how fast do consumer preferences change, how does technology evolve, which assets are available at which terms, etc.). Finally, the institutional environment influences, for example, the transaction costs of acquiring and divesting assets as firms adjust their boundaries through ongoing commercial experimentation. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies","entrepreneurship; institutions; judgment; organizational structure; uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059532074

Addressing these research gaps, this study investigates how PSM relates to relational job resources, work engagement, and outcomes. We thereby account for both direct and moderating effects of PSM and consider positive (employee performance) and negative outcomes (sickness absenteeism and presenteeism). We empirically test our model in the German public sector and find that the PSM dimensions relate differently to the assessed outcomes, providing varying support for our hypotheses. In particular, commitment to public value and compassion seem to drive the positive effect of PSM on employee performance, whereas self-sacrifice and client orientation are linked to reduced absenteeism, and only compassion is associated with increased presenteeism. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059310665

A distinction between uncontrolled stereotype activation in the interpretation of information and controlled stereotype application in decision making is made to allow for a more nuanced study. A unique design combining semistructured interviews and a vignette experiment is presented to accommodate this theoretical framework. Results show that stereotype activation is conditioned by class difference and involves both categorization and simplified assumptions. Stereotype application is conditioned by class as well as by the homogeneity of the social contexts of street-level institutions. These results suggest that in order to decrease stereotypical bias in frontline encounters, one solution may be to increase social heterogeneity. © 2018 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059288924

The challenge that complex problems pose to boundedly rational managers—the need to find a high-performing combination of interdependent choices—is akin to identifying a high peak on a rugged performance “landscape” that managers must discover through sequential search. Building on the NK model that Levinthal introduced into the management literature in 1997, scholars have used simulation methods to construct performance landscapes and examine various aspects of effective search processes. We review this literature to identify common themes and mechanisms that may be relevant in different managerial contexts. Based on a systematic analysis of 71 simulation studies published in leading management journals since 1997, we identify six themes: learning modes, problem decomposition, cognitive representations, temporal dynamics, distributed search, and search under competition. We explain the mechanisms behind the results and map all of the simulation articles to the themes. In addition, we provide an overview of relevant empirical studies and discuss how empirical and formal work can be fruitfully combined. Our review is of particular relevance for scholars in strategy, entrepreneurship, or innovation who conduct empirical research and apply a process lens. More broadly, we argue that important insights can be gained by linking the notion of search in rugged performance landscapes to practitioner-oriented practices and frameworks, such as lean startup or design thinking. © The Author(s) 2018.","bounded rationality; complexity; NK model; performance landscape; problem solving; search; simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058663673

The decline in the earnings gap is driven by increases in hours worked by women as well as a decline in the gender wage gap. The data show a great deal of segregation across education tracks, occupations, and even workplaces, but this segregation has declined since 1980. These changes in segregation have been accompanied by a reduction in the role of observables in explaining the gender wage gap. The residual gender wage gap has been constant since 1980. The hours gap is not affected by changes in segregation at the occupation and education level: differences in these characteristics for women relative to men do not contribute to the hours gap in 2010 and they did not in 1980. However, a firm-worker fixed effects analysis suggests that 30 percent of the gender hours gap can be explained by the sorting of women into lower-hours workplaces. The hours gap is driven by mothers, the group for whom differences in employer, occupation, education, and experience also imply large differences in wages. The combined effect of hours and wages is a more than 20 percent gender earnings gap among well-attached (halftime-plus) workers between 25 and 60 years old, 10 percent of which cannot be explained by differences in hours, or in the readily observable characteristics of these workers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Gender pay gap; Sorting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058459106

The study is based on a qualitative in-depth case study and adopts a social constructionist approach to identification. The paper adds theoretically to the literature on languages in international business in three ways. First, it illustrates that fulfilling a role as local intermediary affects identification processes among subsidiary employees. Second, the paper shows that the literature on organisational identification contributes in conceptualising local intermediaries' motivation for identification in terms of self-enhancement and sense-making. Third, the empirical analysis indicates that feelings of self-esteem and sense-making may derive from symbolic resources for constructing workplace-related identities that prevail within the societal context of the subsidiary. In terms of managerial relevance, the study shows the importance of identifying the subsidiary employees that fulfil roles as local intermediaries in order to recognise their efforts and to foster organisational identification. When doing so, it might be relevant to consider prevailing symbolic resources in the local context, rather than the language.

A prominent theory in behavioral economics is that the decision about whether to behave dishonestly involves a balance between securing greater gains, on the one hand, and maintaining a good self-image, on the other. In the present study, I explore whether simple manipulation of default behavior can influence this balance. In a laboratory experiment using a sample of the general population, the impact of default answers on dishonesty is studied. In a task of reporting the outcome of die rolls in private, I randomly impose default answers. The defaults are either high and favorable, low and unfavorable, the expected mean of the die rolls, or an empty condition with no default. I find that the high default answers are effective at increasing reporting, whereas the low defaults do not result in a corresponding reduction, compared to no default or the expected mean as the default answer. As a reference group, the experiment is repeated among a student sample with the results revealing that students react differently to the defaults. In particular, students did not increase their answers with high defaults, but including the mean as a default answer resulted in a significantly higher degree of cheating. © 2018","Cheating; Defaults; Die task; Experiment; Non-students; Reference points; Students",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057421990

The model was estimated on the basis of disaggregate data at the shipment level (Swedish CFS and French ECHO data). Several transport costs specifications and nesting structures were tested and elasticities compared with reference literature. It was found that freight models are characterised by heterogeneity, non-linearity in transport costs and hence Value of Times and non-constant rates of substitution.

Silica nanoparticles are environmentally friendly nanoparticles that have high heat transfer potential due to its abundant natural resources, low cost synthesis and mass production. The surface and atomic structure of the nanoparticles have been investigated through SEM and FTIR tests. After production of nanoparticles, water/silica nanofluid samples were prepared using two-step method that called eco-friendly nanofluid. Stability and thermal conductivity of the eco-friendly nanofluid were examined. Investigating the stability of the prepared samples, the DLS and TEM tests have been conducted as well as periodic visual observation of possible sedimentation over a period of six months through photography. The stability results indicated that the prepared samples possess excellent nano-structure and it showed long-time stability even after six months of preparation. The thermal conductivity measurement of the samples has been done in different temperatures ranging from 25 to 55 °C and solid volume fractions of 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3%. The results showed the maximum thermal conductivity enhancement of 38.2% which took place at the temperature of 55 °C and solid volume fraction of 3%. Moreover, new precise correlation to predict the thermal conductivity of the eco-friendly nanofluid has been proposed with the maximum deviation of 2.72%. Finally, according to the results, it can be claimed that synthesis of environmentally friendly nanoparticles of silicon oxide with a plant source for nanofluid production is important, and this type of nanofluid can be introduced as an environmentally friendly alternative fluid with high heat transfer potential in thermal systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Eco-friendly nanofluid; Experimental; New correlation; Silica nanoparticles; Stability; Thermal conductivity","Convergence of numerical methods; Crystal atomic structure; Environmental protection; Heat transfer; Silica nanoparticles; Silicon oxides; Stability; Synthesis (chemical); Thermal conductivity; Thermal conductivity of solids; Volume fraction; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Experimental; Long time stabilities; Nanofluids; New correlations; Solid volume fraction; Thermal conductivity enhancement; Thermal conductivity measurements; Nanofluidics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056197139

A dominant assertion is that goal-oriented leadership strategies, such as transformational leadership, foster public service motivation (PSM). However, existing studies rely on designs that are vulnerable to endogeneity and rarely investigate the scope conditions of the leadership-PSM relationship. Combining a field experiment with 364 managers and surveys of their 3,470 employees, the authors show that transformational leadership and transactional leadership, when induced experimentally, do not have the claimed positive effect on PSM. In fact, the results indicate that goal-oriented leadership can have demotivating effects when employee and organizational values are incongruent. Public managers should therefore carefully assess existing levels of value (in)congruence before implementing goal-oriented leadership strategies, and—in case of value conflicts—seek to align perceptions of the desirable among members of the organization. © 2018 by The American Society for Public Administration",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056157888

However, research has found that such collaborations frequently fail, and has pointed to conflicting demands of control and openness. On the one hand, firms want controlled and selective participation, clarity of purpose, and a choice of ideas based on their own current capacity and value appropriation strategies. On the other, their external contributors tend to want open and unfettered participation, the creative potential of the idea per se, and unrestricted knowledge sharing. This article proposes to shift the conceptual frame from looking at the tensions between control and openness as problems to looking at them as synergies. Drawing on the literature of open innovation and organizational paradox, this article contributes a novel perspective on open innovation that suggests how firms can leverage open innovation collaborations through paradox by combining practices based on differentiation and integration. © 2018 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Creative potentials; Current capacity; Knowledge-sharing; Open innovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054902830

While techniques such as business wargaming can effectively support this process, such techniques can benefit from placing competitive considerations within a broader future landscape shaped by geopolitical, social, technological and economic forces. Scenario planning allows for the exploration of interactions across multiple external forces to create a rich set of narratives on how the future may unfold. This paper will discuss the potential of combining scenario planning and business wargaming to enable strategists to anticipate moves and countermoves and foresee their consequences. We use a real-life case study to illustrate how a scenario-planning exercise can guide the crucial stage of selecting relevant future competitors of a firm prior to engaging in a business-war-gaming exercise. We then introduce what we term the prospective competitive strategy process to guide the analysis of potential competitive dynamics, emphasizing the synergies between scenario planning and business wargaming. © 2018 The Authors","Business war gaming; Competitive landscape; Foresight; Scenario planning","business cycle; competitiveness; planning process; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054751922

BIM has already brought a profound change in that direction, by allowing execution of efficient collaborative workflows. However, design decision-making still relies heavily on rules of thumb and previous experiences, and not on sound evidence. To improve the design process and effectively build towards a sustainable future, we need to rely on the multiplicity of data available from our existing building stock. The objective of this research is, therefore, to transform existing data, discover new knowledge and inform future design decision-making in an evidence-based manner. This article looks specifically into this task by (1) outlining and distinguishing between the diverse building data sources and types, (2) indicating how the data can be analysed, (3) demonstrating how the discovered knowledge can be implemented in a semantic integration layer and (4) how it can be brought back to design professionals through the design aids they use.

Using in-depth, historical case-study approach, the article investigates how companies integrate political and social resources in this market. Corporate performance includes traditional measures, such as accounting performance and nonfinancial measures like the ease of doing business. The study finds that social strategies are stronger enablers of firm long-term performance than political strategies. The latter have a short-term impact on performance, but their success over time is limited. The main drawback of reliance on political resources in EMs is the lack of political stability, fragmented polity, and weak political coalitions. We identify rather limited evidence of firms using these two strategies as complements. Thus, we suggest that firms should employ both these strategies in the EM. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053848938

In large organizations, characterized by distributed settings, to speed up innovation and time-to-market, managers need to find ways to enable knowledge sharing and collaboration among individuals and teams located in different geographical areas. Managers have a choice of different strategies and IT tools to support employee collaboration. Through the institutional theory lens, the objective of this research is to better understand the challenges of selecting and using collaborative IT tools in a geographically distributed setting. To this end, we have collected data via a case study of a large IT organization that introduced a centralized mandated IT tool aimed at enabling collaboration among employees working in a distributed setting and belonging to different departments and functions.

We first find and explain three major demand and supply paradoxes, namely collaboration-competition, concord-conflict, and integration-differentiation. We then expand on the handling mechanisms B2B firms employ to respond to these paradoxes. We find that B2B firms that understand, balance, and transcend demand and supply paradoxes achieve greater synergy between demand and supply activities and leverage both demand and supply approaches as overarching guiding principles for their strategy. Our study informs B2B marketing and marketing strategy by exploring the nature and role of paradoxes that shape the relationships between demand and supply activities.

For this reason, it is required to clearly define which are the methods and digital tools that cities should pursue to fully exploit the potential of these platforms in terms of enhancing global collaborations.

The evaluation has taken into account the current use of co-creation approaches by eight smart cities involved in the SynchroniCity project, and considered as the current best practices in Europe. The analysis focused on timing, stakeholders, activities for involving citizens, rewarding systems, tools and metrics used to investigate the success of their implementation. Ten methods and twelve tools have been selected as the one best supporting smart cities in service design and their real application has been investigated through an online questionnaire and in depth interviews to the cities. As a result of the study, Living Lab has resulted as the most used and effective method for the smart cities in the EU for service design. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Co-creation; Internet of things; Living labs; Participatory design; Service design; Smart cities",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049369176

Drawing on Penrose's growth theory, we suggest that the relationship between early employment growth and long-run survival is conditional on employee turnover. We argue that higher employee turnover reduces joint experience in the firm and disrupts the development and eventual exploitation of the firm's productive opportunity set, thereby reducing long-term utilization of early employment expansion. These arguments suggest that the firm's ability to realize long-term benefits of early employment growth is contingent upon low employee turnover following this initial expansion. Using the Danish Integrated Database for Labor Market Research, we show that only when employee turnover is low, will early employment growth lead to higher survival in the long run. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Employees; Growth; New ventures; Survival; Turnover",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048539292

However, the issue of how the outsourcing decisions in the NPD process are best undertaken by the firms has not been fully addressed. Understanding factors influencing the decision of innovation outsourcing more likely remains a need within the current research stream. As it stands, the existing literature takes account of neither a complete set of decision making dimensions, nor the specificity of the NPD process, especially when a disruptive technology fosters product innovation. Although these studies have analysed the antecedents of the innovation outsourcing, the decision-making dimensions are not considered in an integrated multidimensional decision-making model, that considers the inter-related effects of their contemporaneous consideration. There are, therefore, significant gaps in the literature, which this article intends to fill. Our study aims to understand how organisations approach outsourcing decisions relating to NPD activities in technology intensive industries, and the performance implications of these decisions. The context of the study is that of aircraft industry. Therefore, this article discusses the findings of an empirical research that explores an embedded and in-depth longitudinal case study, namely, the Boeing 787-8 programme (the first model of the B787 Dreamliner programme). This new aircraft is a disruptive technology product innovation within the industry because it adopts new material technologies that make it possible to meet future customer needs. The programme has radically changed the partnership model adopted in the industry's supply chain. The aim of the empirical research is to verify how the proposed model works to investigate outsourcing strategies related to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner programme. The research question that we aim to answer is: which strategic dimensions in a decision-making model are able to extensively and thoroughly address the outsourcing decisions relating to NPD activities given the hypothesis that a disruptive technology fosters product innovation? © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","aircraft industry; case study; corporate entrepreneurship; innovation management; new product development management; Outsourcing; technology management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048059663

The popularity of these fields of research has led to the evolution of a vast number of publications in the literature. Various journals have so far contributed to the advancement of the field, with the International Journal of Production of Research (IJPR) being one of the most prominent contributed journals. To celebrate the 55th volume anniversary of IJPR, this review study aims to investigate the studies in the area of RL&CLSCM published in IJPR. The paper presents a thorough bibliometric and content analysis of 94 studies that were published in IJPR from 2000 until July 2017. The studies initially underwent a rigorous bibliometric and mapping analysis that helped to identify their characteristics. Subsequently, the contents of the sample papers were evaluated thoroughly. The content analysis led to classification of the papers into two main categories and sub-categories, and then to rigorous identification of the papers’ attributes. The bibliometric and content analysis disclosed several research gaps that remain to be addressed in IJPR. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bibliometric; closed loop supply chain management; IJPR; reverse logistics; review","Logistics; Publishing; Reviews; Bibliometric; Closed-loop supply chain management; Content analysis; Environmentally-friendly practices; IJPR; International journals; Mapping analysis; Reverse logistics; Supply chain management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047909922

This article shows that, beneath surface stability, Danish EOs have significantly adapted structurally and functionally to survive environmental pressures. However, rather than converging onto a liberal market trajectory, we find that Danish EOs have layered new functions onto traditional collective functions. We also find significant variations in functional adaptation depending on the employer constituencies' exposure to international competition and position in value chains. We argue that these adaptations imply that the provision of collective goods, especially in collective bargaining, is no longer sufficient for the survival of EOs. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","change; coordination; Denmark; employers' organisations; internationalisation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047451896

However, these measures cannot tell us how well democracy aid supports the central promise of democracy: accountable government. Since institutions can be subverted in various ways that undermine accountability, it is vital to know whether democracy aid supports accountability to assess its overall success. We provide evidence for this by analyzing incumbent turnover in elections, following poor economic performance—the economic vote—as a measure of voting to achieve performance accountability. In our analysis of over 1,100 elections in 114 developing countries between 1975 and 2010, we find distinct evidence that increasing receipt of democracy aid is associated with more economic voting.

We investigate the case of an experimental space that was instrumental in initiating the institutionalization of the European carbon market. Our findings highlight the key role of emotions in the simultaneous distancing from institutionalized patterns and engagement in an alternative action model. We subsequently develop a process model of how experimental spaces initiate institutional innovation in institutionalized fields. This model comprises three forms of institutional work. As previously established, boundary work consists in delineating the space from the field, hence mitigating external institutional pressures. We argue that two additional forms of institutional work are required when field conditions are unconducive to institutional innovation. Distancing work consists in designing rules and procedures that alleviate space members’ deep-seated attachment to the field’s dominant models. Anchoring work refers to the design of rules and procedures that connect the experimental space and the solution developed inside it to the field, hence facilitating its broader diffusion. We conclude with a discussion of how the design of experimental spaces and the deliberate use of emotions open new doors for generating institutional innovation. © The Author(s) 2018.","anchoring work; boundary work; distancing work; emotional inhibitors; experimental spaces; institutional innovation; institutional work; positive emotions, emotional facilitators",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041525382

While recent studies have started to investigate which types of data generated in these systems can support managers in their selection decisions, less attention has been placed on the crowd of contributors and the idea itself. Building on team diversity and information processing literatures, this study extends current research by examining how contributors' knowledge diversity, the framing of their feedback (positive and negative), and the degree of idea elaboration influence selection decisions in web-enabled ideation systems. Understanding the role of contributors is arguably important considering that the increasing integration of community functionalities enables employees to participate not only by generating ideas, but also by offering different types of knowledge and feedback to others' ideas, thus giving rise to new forms of online participation. At the same time, individuals' abilities and efforts invested in the formulation of ideas are claimed to influence how managers evaluate them, an aspect that has received limited attention in these online settings. This study is based on a rich and extensive data set of 726 ideas and 2925 comments submitted by employees to an online ideation platform of a large European firm over the course of 16 months. The findings reveal that different forms of contributors' diversity and the framing of their feedback have differential effects on idea selection. Ideas attracting contributors from different functional domains are more likely to be selected by managers, while geographic diversity does not have a significant effect on selection. Moreover, feedback that is negatively framed tends to decrease the selection chances of an idea. Finally, ideas with an optimal degree of elaboration are more likely to be selected by managers for funding. Implications for both innovation management research and practitioners are discussed. © 2018 Product Development & Management Association",,"Management; Differential effect; Functional domains; Geographic diversity; Innovation management; Knowledge diversity; Limited attentions; Online participation; Selection decisions; Managers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040737721

By adapting recent econometric methodologies suggested in the related field of speculative bubbles, we find clear evidence for fast diverging (and even explosive) behavior of EMU government bond yields of peripheral countries relative to Germany during the financial and the European debt crisis. This might be caused by flight-to-quality effects to German government bonds coincident with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and by a loss of confidence in the fiscal stability of Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain during the European debt crisis. First, we find compelling evidence for bubbles in the Dow Jones Equity Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) index which serves as a weekly measure of economic activity in the North American real estate sector. Second, in our main analysis, we test whether the collapsing bubble in the housing market triggered the diverging government bond yields during two crisis regimes. Our findings indicate that this was the case in the course of the financial crisis, but not during the EMU sovereign debt crisis.
