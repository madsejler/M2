To prevent CVD complications, identifying groups according to their abilities to control hypertension is highly important. In previous studies, objective distance was proposed as a measurement for identifying groups of elderly people with hypertension. However, this measurement still has a problem requiring the further elimination of insignificant factors affecting classification accuracy. Therefore, a weighted objective distance (WOD) is proposed as a new measurement, which can address significant individual factors to obtain higher classification accuracy. WOD is based on the concept that hypertension controllability in each individual can be represented by different significant individual factors, which can be used for group classification. Therefore, WOD represents a modification of the original objective distance measurement, using weighting factors. Weighting factors obtained from information gain can prioritize factors according to their associated weights. WOD is assumed to be able to provide greater classification accuracy than the original objective distance. To test this assumption, the secondary data for 1198 elderly people with hypertension were collected. The WOD method provided classification results with 97.33% accuracy, which is higher than the original objective distance method, which provided 70.03% accuracy, consistent with the proposed assumption. To validate the WOD method, the classification accuracy was compared against those provided by decision tree and neural network classifiers. The results showed that the WOD method was more accurate than the decision tree and neural network classifiers, which provided 71.12% and 71.62% accuracy, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cardiovascular disease; Elderly people; Hypertension; Information gain; Objective distance; Weighting factors","Decision trees; Cardiovascular disease; Classification accuracy; Classification results; Group classification; Individual factors; Information gain; Neural network classifier; Weighting factors; Neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092366574

In response, we developed an approach to consistently combine state-of-the-art emission inventory and impact assessment models for assessing human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity impacts from pesticide applications, and tested our approach in an LCA case study on pesticides applied to an open-field tomato produced in Martinique (French West Indies). Our results show that impact scores vary over several orders of magnitude, mainly as function of differences in pesticide properties and application time in relation to crop growth stage. Overall, impacts related to pesticide field emissions leading to exposure to pesticide residues in crop harvest are a main contributor to LCA performance results for tomato produced in Martinique, with fertilizer and packaging manufacturing as other dominating aspects. While the proposed approach is applicable to refine currently LCA methods for assessing pesticides, large uncertainties remain. These are mostly related to the parametrization of impact factors for tropical species. Based on our findings, we recommend using initial emission distribution fractions in combination with steady-state characterization factors for environmental emissions and with time-dependent characterization factors for pesticide residues in crop harvest in LCA, while further improving the use of secondary emission fractions to allow for better consideration of local field, soil and climate characteristics. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Active ingredient; Human health; Life cycle assessment; Modeling; Tropical conditions","Crops; Fruits; Life cycle; Secondary emission; Toxicity; Uncertainty analysis; Characterization factors; Climate characteristics; Emission distribution; Environmental emissions; Environmental evaluation; Fruits and vegetables; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pesticide applications; Pesticides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091214820

The industry response to this demand has been the creation of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the development of a certification system to ensure sustainable palm oil production. However, currently there is no scientific evidence of the benefit gained through the RSPO certification schema. This paper quantifies the environmental impacts of RSPO certified and non-certified through a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of RBD palm oil to factory gate, produced in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2016, to identify potential benefits and trade-offs of RSPO certification. The ISO 14040/14044 compliant LCA is carried out following both a consequential and an attributional LCA approach. The inventory model presents a high level of detail. Primary inventory data describing the certified production system are obtained from RSPO assessment reports, covering 73% (634 estates) of the certified estate, including 111 smallholders, and 58% (165 oil mills) of the certified mills. Data for the total industrial production are drawn from national statistics and scientific literature. The non-certified flows are derived by subtracting the certified flows from the total industry flows. The consequential results show that RSPO certified oil reduces GHG emission by 35% compared to non-certified i.e. 3.41 (2.61–4.48) kg CO2 eq./kg for certified vs 5.34 (3.34–8.16) kg CO2 eq./kg for non-certified. Based on a thorough data quality assessment and uncertainty analysis, this result is deemed sufficiently robust and thus conclusive. Certified production achieves the largest GHG emissions reduction because of higher yields, i.e. less land use per unit of product, less oil palm cultivated on peat soil and higher share of palm oil mill effluents treated with biogas capture technologies. We also found that nature occupation is reduced by 20% in certified production while respiratory inorganic is slightly higher (3%) in certified production, due to the larger use of fertilisers. For other impact categories, results are associated with a larger uncertainty and therefore shall be considered as indicative. Similar results are found in attributional modelling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity; Carbon footprint; GHG emissions; Palm oil; RSPO certified","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Effluents; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Petroleum industry; Soils; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Certification systems; Data quality assessment; Industrial production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); National statistics; Palm oil mill effluents; Scientific evidence; Scientific literature; Palm oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091122528

Here, the dahlia flower-like nickel-based composites have been synthesized through a hydrothermal reaction, and was used as an efficient oxygen reduction reaction catalyst in a single chamber microbial fuel cell. The physical characterization of surface structure suggests the composites have successfully prepared. The MFC with Ni-melamine cathode can achieve obviously higher power density of 378.08 mW m−2 than those of Ni-urea cathode (244.02 mW m−2) and Ni-dicyandiamide cathode (201.67 mW m−2). A series of electrochemical characterization suggests that Ni-melamine electrode possesses larger electrochemical active surface area, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher oxygen reduction performance than those of Ni-urea electrode and Ni-dicyandiamide electrode. The electrochemical measurements have also demonstrated that nickel-melamine composites can be involved in oxygen reduction reaction via a four-electron route due to the high-efficient electrocatalytic activity. In addition, the maximum power density of nickel-based composites is obviously increased with an increase of catalysts coating amounts. When the loading amounts are 4 mg cm−2, the power density for nickel-based composites is improved to 1421.4 mW m−2, which is 1.68 times higher than that of Pt/C due to the introduction of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen element. Thus, nickel-based composite is an effective and promising catalyst material for microbial fuel cell to substitute Pt/C for oxygen reduction reaction application. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Microbial fuel cells; Nickel-based composites; Oxygen reduction performance; Stability","Catalysts; Cathodes; Charge transfer; Electrolytic reduction; Electrophysiology; Metabolism; Nickel coatings; Nickel compounds; Oxygen reduction reaction; Oxygen vacancies; Surface structure; Urea; Urea electrodes; Bio-electrochemical reactors; Charge transfer resistance; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical active surface areas; Electrochemical characterizations; Electrochemical measurements; Oxygen reduction catalysts; Physical characterization; Microbial fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091111268

This is particularly the case for developing countries, for example over 90% of FW in China is currently blended with municipal solid waste and disposed of by landfilling and incineration. The anaerobic digestion (AD) technologies for energy recovery, however, has often been identified as an effective approach for mitigating FW treatment related GHG emissions. In order to benchmark and quantify such reduction potentials, a dynamic model has been built to characterize the generation and flow of FW and treatment associated GHG emissions in China from 2001 to 2040. Our results show that the total FW generation from household and catering sectors reached 170 ± 30 Mt in 2018 and will steadily increase to approximately 220 ± 42 Mt by 2040. Accordingly, the FW treatment related GHG emissions reached 137 ± 26 Mt CO2e in 2018 and would rise to approximately 180 Mt±33 CO2e by 2040 if waste management continues with the current pattern in a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario. Compared to the BAU scenario, the scenarios subject to AD technology implementation (from conservative to optimistic) could significantly reduce GHG emissions and ensure a proportional contribution of this sector to China's national emission reduction goal (55% by 2025 and 65% by 2030 compared to 2005). Specifically, a cumulative amount of approximately 1.9 Bt CO2e could be mitigated between 2019 and 2040 under the optimistic scenario (with 60%, 80%, and 80%, respectively, of household food waste, catering food waste, and waste cooking oil treated by AD). These findings could not only inform evidence-based policy making to facilitate the waste-to-energy development for FW treatment in China, but also shed light on the sustainable FW management and AD technology implementation in other developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Climate change mitigation; Food waste; Greenhouse emissions; Waste management","Anaerobic digestion; Developing countries; Emission control; Food waste; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Municipal solid waste; Oils and fats; Sustainable development; Thermal processing (foods); Cumulative amount; Effective approaches; Emission reduction; Global sustainability; Reduction potential; Technology implementation; Waste cooking oil; Waste to energy technologies; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091081444

Therefore, this chapter aims at examining how China’s energy security performances have changed over a certain period by proposing a composite energy security index, which uses 18 indicators from six dimensions. Subsequently, the method of CRITIC (Criteria Importance Through Inter-criteria Correlation) is suggested to determine the indicators’ weights for synthesizing the composite index, where the numerical data of the indicators can be fully utilized for determining their relative importance. After that, a fusion aggregation method is introduced to integrate the weighted indicators into the composite index by combining three well-practiced MCDM (multi-criteria decision-making) approaches, and this offers a reliable way for measuring China’s historical energy security. On the basis of the proposed index, an empirical study of China’s energy security was conducted, which demonstrated that the performances in 2013, 2012, and 2002 might be the top three best, while the performance in 2008 could be the worst.

Civil society organisations (CSO) have helped society to develop across various spheres of influence. The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) ushered in an era wherein both business economic objectives as well as socio-environmental responsibilities of firms were prioritized simultaneously. The path of firms and CSOs intersected through CSR. In this work, the authors develop a typology on firm–CSO collaboration regarding CSR initiatives. Design/methodology/approach: The authors through a twin approach of systematic literature review (SLR) with qualitative study developed a categorization of collaborations between a firm and a CSO in the context of CSR engagements. Apart from the SLR, the authors undertook two focus group discussions (FGD) with CSR experts (engaged in firm–CSO collaboration). This was done with a semi-structured discussion agenda frame. The data were content analysed for thematic aspects. Thus, both SLR as well as FGD outputs were considered for the study results. Findings: The authors found six elements in firm–CSO collaboration and seven archetypes of collaboration. The six elements were CSR action elements (CSRAE) consisting of CSR agenda (CSRA), CSR resources (CSRR), CSR capabilities (CSRC), CSR Pprocess (CSRP), CSR monitoring (CSRM) and CSR stakeholder engagement (CSRSE). The seven typologies were CSO as auditor, outsourcing of CSR, CSO-driven CSR, joint CSR, support to CSO for CSR,guided support to CSO and coordinated CSR. Research limitations/implications: Doty and Glick, (1994) had undertaken a seminal work on theory building based upon the unique method of application of typologies. Doty and Glick, (1994) elucidated how application of typologies could through a typology study enhance the scope and level for understanding and modelling in a contextual domain involving theory. This study was a step in this direction in the context of firm–CSO collaboration in the context of CSR initiatives. Practical implications: This study would help managers from both CSOs and business firms to comprehend in which sphere they were required to collaborate like in resource /capabilities deployment or in designing CSR agendas or CSR process or CSR monitoring or in stakeholder engagement during CSR management. This typology would enable managers to comprehend what would be the most suitable form of collaboration between a firm and a CSO for a specific CSR engagement. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies that theorizes regarding firm–CSO collaboration in the context of CSR initiatives both in terms of the collaboration building block elements as well as typology presented. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Civil society organisation; Collaborative framework; Corporate social responsibility; Typology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097561316

Findings: This paper proposes that the strategic design process can shape markets through orchestrating and leveraging market-shaping capabilities. Specifically, it highlights how these capabilities trigger and facilitate purposeful intent; situated and systemic understanding; and collective collaboration. Practical implications: Furthering the notion of strategic design, this paper contributes to clarifying how to interpret and use design as a strategic practice in business management.

This complexity comes at a high cost, and the benefits to be gained from product variety reduction projects are therefore significant. Several methods for the reduction of product complexity have been proposed in the literature. Such methods, however, to a large extent fail to consider the role of ""linked revenue"", i.e., the revenue from the sales of product variants that is lost if other product variants bought by the same customers are eliminated. To address this gap in the literature, this paper develops a procedure for product variety reduction that considers linked revenue. The procedure supports managers in (1) identifying unprofitable products that can be pruned without risking the linked revenue of vital customers, (2) systematically evaluating the profitability and potential of these products, and (3) collecting feedback from affected account managers, before finally deciding which products to eliminate. The procedure is tested using a case study, which shows promising results. © 2020 IEEE.","Complexity management; Linked revenue; Product portfolio optimization; Product variety reduction","Managers; Customer demands; Customized products; High costs; Manufacturing companies; Product complexity; Product variants; Product variety; Support services; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099771502

The purpose of this paper is to expand the literature on quantifying product complexity costs by clarifying the role of data quality. This is done based on a case study at a world-leading healthcare product manufacturer, where reducing product complexity was investigated. The case study showed that poor data quality resulted in extra use of resources for finding the needed data and implied that the scope of the project had to be significantly reduced.

Since the 1970s, literature advocates for a profit-driven approach for maintenance. A profit-driven maintenance approach enables companies to improve operations as it covers the impact from maintenance on the revenue and contribution margins in the company, e.g. by assessing the value of increased or decreased output on the production. In case the industry faces drastic changes due to technological advances - such as increase in automation, Industry 4.0, Big Data, and Internet of Things - and instability on the market, reducing costs of maintenance without considering impact on profit could potentially lead to lost revenue. Without a clear definition of the profit-driven approach - and how to achieve it - both researchers and managers run the risk of losing profitable opportunities.

System integration paves the way for leveraging the Industrial Internet of Things, big data analysis, simulation, cloud computing, and augmented reality. The first step towards system integration is to examine the assets (machine software) ability to exchange information in an I4.0 setting. This paper aims to analyze challenges for asset interoperability by conducting asset integration in the University I4.0 laboratory (I4.0 lab). Conducting asset integration has been a part of building an Information Backbone (IB) as a minimum viable product in the I4.0 lab. An IB is a software infrastructure that involves integrating into various assets, e.g., warehouse, transport, and robotic systems, and providing communication among them. The pilot study reveals that the maturity of assets interoperability readiness are at very different levels, e.g. missing external interfaces, poor documentation, and varying technologies. These challenges need to be further addressed to collect architectural requirements for system integration, and establish a common vocabulary and understanding of I4.0 concepts. © 2020 IEEE.","Asset interoperability; Challenges; Flexible Robots; IIoT; Industry 4.0; Information Processing and Engineering; Software infrastructure; System Integration","Augmented reality; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Interoperability; Laboratories; Flexible production; Information process; Machine software; Pilot studies; Robotic systems; Software infrastructure; System integration; Industry 4.0",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099761448

As IT services consist of a combination of technology, people, and processes, defining appropriate service level metrics has been a complex problem to solve for both researchers and IT managers. Using a systematic literature approach, we investigate the metrics that IT departments should utilise to measure IT service levels. This analysis suggests that service availability and responsiveness metrics are the most commonly employed metrics for approximating the IT service level.

The developed methodology combines a database management system implemented by PostgreSQL with PostGIS and a MATLAB code. The database system is used to collect and store the GPS data from logistics companies. The MATLAB code implements a systematic procedure to process the GPS data and extract parking statistics, such as average length of truck stay, number of parked trucks, and spatial analyses of the parked truck locations. The methodology is applied to a rest area using GPS data from two large Danish logistics companies.

Current issues in welfare production in public sector organisations are seen as a result of the economic rationalisation ideas in new public management, and co-production has been theoretically advanced as a new way to involve citizens in the co-production of welfare.

The shift is seen in the way that a discursive use of the term service provision with embedded logics encompassing fiscal accountability, performance measurement, efficiency, and process regulation has changed towards discourses that embrace collaboration between the public sector front staff and the citizens, with the aim of developing legitimate and effective welfare services that are co-produced by means of active participation and distributed decision making. However, this change requires new approaches to the way in which the implementation of new practices and tools is executed in practice as studied and researched, and how the new practices and tools are understood and evaluated in organizations. Processual Perspectives on the Co-Production Turn in Public Sector Organizations is an essential reference book that examines, unfolds, and develops approaches to co-production and implementation as dynamic, processual, collaborative, sensemaking, and as requiring and resulting in capacity building and learning. Moreover, the book examines new approaches to engage citizens and public sector actors in collaborative and co-productive processes, especially with concern for new goals pertaining to sustainability, social equity, democratic legitimacy, etc. Covering topics that include knowledge management and collective leadership, the book presents perspectives on capacity building, learning, change, and evaluation in organizations and current research in different areas of the public sector. It is intended for public sector administrators and managers investigating the relevancy, approaches, and methods in co-production. Furthermore, it targets civil actors and welfare service users, leaders and managers of public organizations, researchers, academicians, and students in programs that include social welfare development, public administration, political science, and organizational development. © 2021 by IGI Global.

Part of the reason is the fundamental mismatch between the practices in focus (i.e., responsive practices) and the training approach itself (i.e., prescriptive). As an alternative, this chapter explores the merits of co-production for meaningfully and sustainably equipping educators at scale. From a microlevel view of co-productive processes in education settings, the authors illustrate two distinct potentials, which combine to form a flexible program strategy: first, co-production as a sense-making process to contextualize programs, and secondly, co-production as a catalyst for capacity building.

The study also identifies the motives and challenges for Islamic banks for higher involvement in social responsibility initiatives to enhance their brand values. Design/methodology/approach: An inductive approach was used in this study to identify the motives and challenges related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. The research design uses a qualitative approach where in-depth interviews were carried out among the employees in the financial services sector in Saudi Arabia. Findings: Findings provide insights about how CSR initiatives for financial services brands in a developing and Islamic country are perceived. Results show that the focus of CSR activities is on the attribute of CSR, the magnitude of CSR and attitude towards CSR. Results show two main motives to engage in CSR activities, which are instrumental and ethical motives. The main challenges are related to the government, business, charitable organisations and customers and society. Practical implications: Implications exist for how CSR is perceived in a new context and in the financial services industry. Understanding the current perception of CSR from a financial service brand perspective helps policymakers to develop appropriate platforms for financial service providers to become more socially involved. Originality/value: The major contribution of this study lies in investigating the CSR perception among the key stakeholder (i.e. the employees) from a brand management perspective in the Saudi Arabian financial services sector. Further, this study shows the main motives and challenges, which local financial service brands face to become socially responsible. The categories of attributes, magnitude and attitudes can be used to enhance brand value in one of the economically advanced countries in the Arabic world, Saudi Arabia. In the first category “attribute”, the perception of socially responsible banks are highlighted, while the elements of CSR, including its dimensions, are emphasised in the second category “magnitude”.

Design/methodology/approach: The empirical material consists of secondary data as well as six in-depth semi-structured interviews with Danish mayors and city managers in three different municipalities in Denmark. Findings: Intra-organizational counter-narratives differ from inter-organizational counter-narratives but resemble a number of issues known from extra-organizational resistance. Still, significant differences are found within the political arena: lack of ownership, competition for resources and political conflicts. Lack of ownership, internal competition for resources and distrust of motives play an important role within the administrative arena. Mayors are aware of the needs for continued political support for branding projects but projects are nonetheless realized despite resistance if there is a political majority for it. Research limitations/implications: This study points to the implications of city brand resistance and counter-narratives emerging from the “inside” of the political and administrative arenas in the city, here defined as “intra-organizational counter-narratives”.

In AESAs, the safe operating space must be distributed among human activities so impacts associated with an activity can be related to its assigned share of the safe operating space to assess if the activity can be considered absolute sustainable. To ensure choices concerning sharing principles in AESA are deliberate, there is a need for understanding the distributive justice theory underlying the sharing principles. This study provides a framework for determining and communicating the distributive justice theories that underlie the choice of sharing principles in AESA. To comprehensively describe a sharing principle in relation to distributive justice theories, seven dimensions must be defined, i.e. target, currency, pattern, geographical scope, temporal scope, clauses, and constraints. We conducted a review of sharing principles used in AESAs in relation to contemporary distributive justice theories. 18 studies were identified with 34 sharing principles being applied. The most commonly applied sharing principle is equal per capita sharing of the safe operating space among countries or individuals. This was often combined with utilitarian principles for sharing among industrial units. Based on the review and analysis of the results, we provide recommendations on best practice for defining sharing principles in AESAs systematically based on distributive justice theories and recommendations for further research. The framework developed in this study provide a first step towards a systematic and informed selection of sharing principles used in AESAs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Absolute environmental sustainability assessment; Distributive justice; Entitlement; Safe operating space; Sharing principles","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Best practices; Down-scaling; Environmental sustainability; Human activities; Industrial units; Per capita; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089436967

In western countries, the intake of proteins can usually simply be reduced, but substituting even only part of the intake of animal-based proteins with plant-based proteins would also benefit both human health and the environment. The aim of this study was to assess the environmental benefits of using protein-rich side streams from oat beta glucan processing as an ingredient in protein-enriched foods. The environmental impact of food products (bread, pasta, and oatgurt) containing oat protein concentrate (OPC) was assessed using Life Cycle Assessment methodology from cradle-to-processing. The environmental impact was compared with those of regular food products and existing plant protein sources as per kilogram of product (mass) and per kilogram of protein to assess the environmental benefits of novel products. All the ‘high in protein’ versions of foods containing OPC have a nearly equal carbon footprint per kg of protein, and all three products can be used as substitutes for commonly used pasta, bread, and yogurt in the diet. Thus, they all have similar potential to reduce food consumption greenhouse gas emissions. All the foods containing OPC also have very low land use per kg of product compared with the regular products. When products containing OPC are compared with other protein-rich food products, products containing OPC have a smaller carbon footprint per kg of protein compared with animal-based protein sources and a similar footprint with naturally protein-rich plant products like legumes.

Achieving a better understanding of the psychological makeup of consumer ethnocentrism and cosmopolitanism should help managers better design international market segmentation and brand positioning strategies. Design/methodology/approach: The study's conceptual framework is anchored in attitude and values theories, and focuses on the social categorizations that consumers make and how these contribute to the formation of their ethnocentric and cosmopolitan orientations. Drawing data from consumers living in five European countries, we test our theoretical conjectures through structural equation modeling approaches, including multigroup analysis at the country level, as well as the identification and scrutiny of potential pan-European consumer segments. Findings: Findings show that personal values, moral foundations and gender-role identities do exert direct and indirect (partially mediated) effects on the formation of consumers' ethnocentric and cosmopolitan orientations. These provide numerous insights for managers in terms of how they can segment domestic and international markets, as well as how to position products and communicate brand strategies. Research limitations/implications: The study focused on consumers' personal and role identities and offers implications based on data gathered from a sample of five European countries. Future work should broaden this perspective by including other identity facets, such as religious and ethnic identities, as well as product-category and brand-specific outcomes, in order to help develop a more comprehensive picture of the psychology underpinning consumers' identity-related orientations, and their effects on consumer behavior. Future research should also study these issues in a broader geographical context, by including national markets that have culturally diverse populations as well as places with dissimilar cultural and economic profiles. Originality/value: The study shows that individuals' personal values, moral foundations and gender roles have a strong effect on the formation of consumer ethnocentrism and consumer cosmopolitanism orientations. Consideration of how these antecedent constructs operate in concert to shape consumers' in- versus out-group orientations has been overlooked in the international marketing literature. Beyond the ramifications for theory, the study offers numerous substantive managerial implications in terms of how consumers are likely to respond to local and global/foreign products/brands based on these orientations. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer cosmopolitanism; Consumer ethnocentrism; Gender role identity; International market segmentation; Moral foundations; Values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085711076

However, the available empirical evidence regarding this topic is limited and mixed. By adopting an experimental design, the paper’s purpose is to shed light on a causal mechanism behind decision making under uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: This paper outlines the performance of a quasi-laboratory experiment that investigates whether a lack of predictive information affects individuals with entrepreneurial intentions in their likelihood to choose uncertainty vis-à-vis certainty. Drawing on prospect theory, it is argued that individuals with entrepreneurial intentions are less sensitive than individuals without entrepreneurial intentions due to a framing effect that occurs when information about probabilities is manipulated. In particular, it is argued that individuals with entrepreneurial intentions are more likely than their comparable counterparts to choose consistently among monetary opportunities that share everything in common but information about probabilities of success. Findings: This study finds support for the argument, as individuals with entrepreneurial intentions have preferences pertaining to uncertainty that are more stable compared to those of individuals without such intentions. The results hold after controlling for a number of alternative explanations, including status quo bias, prior gain effect and degree of risk effect. Originality/value: The paper tackles a fundamental issue in entrepreneurship—namely behavior under uncertainty—by adopting a novel approach. In particular, an experimental design is used to test for causality between availability of information and choices involving monetary rewards. Results have implications for the understanding of factors that guide entrepreneurial choices under uncertainty and, ultimately, entrepreneurial action. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurship; Framing effect; Risk; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092475279

Design/methodology/approach: The paper consists of a single case study of a microfirm (two employees) originating from Finland, which has successfully internationalized to many African countries. Due to the uniqueness of the context, the authors use semi-structured interviews to collect founders’ insights to the issue being addressed. Moreover, along with interviews, secondary sources related to football talent scouting in Africa are also utilized in the paper. Findings: The authors found that the case company was established with the aim of helping and uplifting poor African footballers, so the business model is CRM. It has scouted many of them for professional football clubs in Europe. The authors further found that sociopolitical legitimacy plays a major role in dealing with African footballers and local stakeholders, while cognitive legitimacy helped the case firm gain the trust of European football clubs.

However, we lack empirical validation of the feasibility and positive outcomes of the new forms of trust-based management recommended by stewardship theory. As such, there are few examples of alternative ways of boosting the motivation of public employees that can serve as beacons for public service organizations (PSOs) eager to find new ways of motivating their staff to create public value for the users of public services and society as a whole. This article aims to remedy this problem by exploring a seemingly successful empirical case of trust-based management to see whether the core principles of stewardship theory apply and how new management practices may influence the motivation and well-being of the employees, the perceived satisfaction and involvement of the users, and overall organizational performance, including cost efficiency. © 2020 by the authors.

Given the rise of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), it is imperative to comprehend how collaboration can be fostered in such Online Learning Environments (OLEs). Synthesizing theories on individual cognition and collective interaction, we advance separate research models for pre- and post-intention that differentiate between the antecedents affecting one's intention to collaborate in OLEs and the consequences arising from the manifestation of such collaborative intention. Hypothesized relationships were subsequently validated with survey data collected from a MOOC course. Analytical results reveal that participants' attitude and intention toward collaboration at the outset of the course are predicted by collaborative outcome expectancy and communal support expectancy, which in turn are precipitated on their perceived ability to work in groups (collaborative process efficacy) and peer influence (communal influence) respectively. Additionally, we uncover that collaborative intention influences course participants' inclination to engage in group work and its three ensuing pedagogical outcomes: a higher rate of retention for course participants, increased production of novel ideas, and an enhanced learning experience.

Using this basic distinction, inspired by Hannah Arendt, I argue the scientific (e.g., economic and financial theory), moral (e.g., codes of conduct) and practical (e.g., training) forms of knowledge being taught in business schools corrode students' ability to think. They are corrosive because they are unthinkingly governed by a singular view of education: To instill habits that eliminate mystery, thereby making the world a more certain place. The aim is to realize organizational conditions of control, order, and uniformity, which in management practice equates to the conscious pursuit of efficiency and effectiveness. Given the extensive critique of this pursuit, both in terms of its hubris and of its pernicious effects on human relations and the wider environment, I ask “What if questions of knowledge were subsumed by ones of meaning?” Here, control, order, and uniformity make way for thoughtfulness. For Arendt, thinking is the capacity and willingness to refuse the monopolizing force of truth, and to keep truths in the company of their contraries. Education that institutes thinking rather than knowledge, encourages a plural, open awareness of a world that is, essentially, ungovernable. To relate to things thoughtfully, rather than knowledgably, is to develop what Arendt calls conscience. The conscience she speaks of is not a restraining force that pushes away untruths and installs certainty. Rather, it arises from the experience of questioning the certainties woven into human practices by considering how to begin them anew. If instituted though business schools, it places unruliness at the heart of management practice. © Academy of Management Learning & Education",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099202927

Risk aversion and the subjective discount rate are found to be in the orders of 2 and 0, respectively, not diverging far away from results from other studies. Our estimate of EIS in the order of 10 is larger than often reported. Background variables like age and income have little predictive power for the three estimates.

Both studies follow a 2 × 2 between-subject design with an additional control group whereby temporal distance and social distance are manipulated to outline weaknesses of current antipoaching campaigns and identify alternatives that are more effective. Results suggest that economic and identity-related factors can explain consumers (China) and poachers (Kenya) intentions to purchase traditional Chinese medicine with rhino horn or sell rhino horn. In both countries, marketing campaigns featuring temporal distance were superior to close counterparts; yet, the mediating variables differ for each country. Close temporal distance elicits reactance. Interestingly, poachers do not seem to discriminate between close and far social distance.

The paper, therefore, presents a new conceptual model for European science diplomacy that can enable more equitable ways of dealing with colonial heritage in relations between EU countries and partners outside Europe. It does so by combining recent literature on science diplomacy, heritage diplomacy, decolonial thinking, and on the concepts of interculturality. We argue that to engage successfully with colonial legacies and heritage, the concept of science diplomacy needs to be developed from a traditional “diffusionist” understanding towards a dialogical approach, which is epismologically open and acknowledges the inequalities in global knowledge production.

Since decision noise leads to bias in most elicitation tasks, there is a risk of falsely interpreting noise-driven relationships as preference driven. This puts previous studies that found a negative relation between personality measures and risk aversion into perspective and in particular raises the question of how to achieve robust inference in this domain. This paper shows, by way of an economic experiment with subjects from all walks of life, that using structural estimation to model heterogeneity of noise in combination with a balanced design allows us to mitigate the bias problem. Our estimations show that cognitive ability is related to noisy behavior rather than risk preferences.

The objective of this research therefore is to understand the contributing factors for adopting big data in AEC firms. The investigation combined the perceived strategic value of BDA with the TOE framework (technology, organization, and environment), to develop and test a holistic model on big data adoption. A set of hypotheses derived from the extant literature was tested on data from structured surveys of about 365 firms, categorised as construction service firms (engineering and architecture) and construction firms (firms engaged in managing construction projects). The results indicated that the inhibitors and facilitators of BDA adoption are different in the construction services (architecture and engineering) and construction firms.

We argue that the extent to which new group members have experience working as specialists or generalists is a critical factor in explaining performance after the new member joins. We conceptualize specialists as those who concentrate on a particular component of an organization's task, whereas generalists perform all components of the task. As such, a specialist must coordinate with other group members to complete the group's task, which makes a specialist more interdependent with other members and in possession of more organization-specific knowledge than a generalist. We predict that (1) groups receiving specialist new members do not perform as well after the new member joins as compared with groups receiving generalist new members and (2) groups with new members whose work experience and recipient group structure are aligned (i.e., generalist movers into generalist groups and specialist movers into specialist groups) perform better than groups with new members whose experience and recipient group structure are not aligned. We test our hypotheses using a laboratory study in which we manipulate the extent to which new members and incumbent members of recipient groups work as specialists or generalists. Participants work as generalists or specialists in three-person groups and receive a new member who acquired experience as a specialist or generalist in another group. We find support for our hypotheses and provide evidence on mechanisms through which potential new members' backgrounds enable them to contribute significantly to their recipient groups. New members who acquire experience in a structure similar to that of their recipient organizations report that they experience greater fit with their new groups, which enables their recipient groups to perform better than groups where new members' experience and recipient group structure are not aligned. Additionally, our results suggest generalists may be more likely than specialists to transfer knowledge to their new groups.

In this contribution, we refer to the fire aboard the ship Scandinavian Star in 1990 and the terror attack at Utøya in 2011 as examples. We establish a terminological ontology for 46 Danish concepts included in an alphabetically organized term list on incident management by the Danish Emergency Management Agency (DEMA). Based on this ontology, the main aim is to demonstrate how terminological principles may form the basis for creating structured data, which may support a common understanding of domain-specific key concepts which again is a prerequisite for successful and well-functioning disaster management systems. The terminological method will be explained, focusing on terminological ontologies and terminological definitions reflecting the semantic structure of the domain. Further, we illustrate the use of technology for knowledge modelling and sharing, and we briefly describe how the results of terminology work may be stored in a term bank in order to support common understanding and efficient communication. Moreover, terminological ontologies may lay the foundation for data models for disaster management systems, technologies involving Artificial Intelligence, and building blocks of semantic technologies. © 2020 The Authors.

As such, cultural evolution is highly relevant for the emerging “science of science communication” (SSC) in that it can help organize and guide the study of science communication efforts aimed at spreading scientifically accurate information and inspiring behavioral change. Here, I synthesize insights and theory from cultural evolution with central findings and concepts within the SSC with the aim of highlighting the inherent, but underexplored, consilience between these two fields. I demonstrate how cultural evolution can serve as an unifying framework for the SSC and how, conversely, science communication can serve as a fertile testing ground for applying, exploring, and advancing cultural evolutionary theory in a real-world setting that matters.

Due to accounting being an applied social science, many stakeholders question the relevance and value of research published in accounting journals to the accounting profession, practitioners and society in general. This paper highlights the various areas of criticism and discusses factors which underline the issue. While most of the criticism is anecdotal, this study sets about to empirically explore practitioners’ perception of academia, and research published in academic accounting journals. To better understand the situation in accounting, a comparison of two other applied academic disciplines is undertaken, involving medical and engineering practitioners. The study found that for accounting there were major differences in the sourcing of information, and significant differences between the other two applied fields with respect to the utilisation and the need for academic material. The findings lead to the conclusion that academic accounting researchers are now nearly totally divorced from the real-world profession of accounting. If we were to take a singular view on the purpose of academic accounting research, then the current situation could leave accounting researchers very vulnerable to adverse decisions with respect to the allocation of future government funding. The conclusions of this paper propose a series of thought-provoking questions about the current state of accounting research, in the hope that it will stimulate debate and generate responses from the accounting community and other stakeholders. © 2020 by the authors.

As the business environment undergoes a fundamental transition in the twenty-first century, we believe that understanding the evolving role of the CHQ from an organization design perspective will offer unique insights into the nature of business activity in the future. The purpose of this article, in keeping with the theme of the Journal of Organization Design Special Collection, is thus to invigorate research into the CHQ. We begin by explicating four canonical questions related to the design of the CHQ. We then survey fundamental changes in the business environment occurring in the twenty-first century, and discuss their potential implications for CHQ design. When suitable here we also refer to the contributions published in our Special Collection. Finally, we put forward recommendations for advancements and new directions for future research to foster a deeper and broader understanding of the topic. We believe that we are on the cusp of a change in the CHQ as radical as that which saw its initial emergence in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century.

In contrast, International Business (IB) scholars have shown that subsidiaries play an emergent role in MNC innovation activities and have highlighted the relevance of subsidiaries' external and internal linkages. In this paper, we bring together these perspectives by examining OI at the subsidiary level within MNCs and test our hypotheses through an empirical analysis using data from 91 MNC subsidiaries. Our findings show an inverted U-shaped relationship between the openness of subsidiaries to external knowledge sources and innovation performance. Moreover, we find that subsidiaries' internal embeddedness positively moderates the above relationship. Practically, our findings suggest the need for MNC and subsidiary managers to develop mechanisms to manage intra-organizational relations in order to achieve improved innovation performance while leveraging of external knowledge sources at the subsidiary level, thus favoring MNCs' knowledge management (KM) approach.

However, the reconstruction of accurate life tables starting from a given level of life expectancy at birth, or any other age, is not straightforward. Model life tables have been extensively used for estimating age patterns of mortality in poor-data countries. We propose a new model inspired by indirect estimation techniques applied in demography, which can be used to estimate full life tables at any point in time, based on a given value of life expectancy at birth. Our model relies on the existing high correlations between levels of life expectancy and death rates across ages.

Such restrictions jeopardize the quality of research because the study of any phenomenon requires the use of multiple methodological procedures to avoid the systematic biases, errors, omissions, and limitations introduced by any single option. Therefore, we propose the use of triangulation as a strategy for building methodological alternatives into research designs. Institutionalization of this principle in the field of international business has the potential to enhance both the rigor and scope of future inquiry. © 2020, Academy of International Business.","IB paradigm; methodological bandwidth; methodological innovation; methodological rigor; methodological trends; methods complexity; methods diversity; triangulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094141100

The paper argues for a moderate interpretation of group privacy, stressing that group privacy is a matter of privacy for the members constituting the group. Although data-driven knowledge discovery implies profiling by group categorization, this observation does not constitute a reason to introduce a right to group privacy for other purposes than to protect the individual's right to privacy.

However, there are few studies on the relationship between the dynamics of social capital amid urban renewal (DSCUR) and the dynamics of residential satisfaction (DRS). This paper, therefore, evaluates the relationship between DSCUR and DRS in urban renewal areas in the center of Chongqing, China. The DSCUR and DRS are measured by residents' subjective perceived change. Six urban renewal projects in different stages were selected and a questionnaire survey that attracted 1086 respondents was conducted between December 1st, 2018, and April 1st, 2019. Results from partial least squares-structural equation modeling of the collected data show that all but one of the study's hypotheses are supported; the exception is a new variable developed by the paper's author referred to as ‘dynamics of eviction and gentrification’. The study found that DSCUR is positively correlated with DRS and that the dynamics of social connectedness, the dynamics of social trust, and the dynamics of reciprocity contribute most to DSCUR. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Forced relocation; Gentrification; Reciprocity; Residential satisfaction; Social capital; Social connectedness; Social trust; Structural equation modeling; Urban renewal","forced migration; gentrification; multivariate analysis; reciprocity; relocation; residential satisfaction; social capital; urban renewal; China; Chongqing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091597309

However, most existing literature on organizational conflict focuses on overt forms of conflict expression and handling. While covert conflict exists and shapes the collective organizing of conflict in organizations, the relationship between overt and covert forms of conflict has not yet been well explicated. This article offers a novel perspective on the dynamics of overt and covert conflict in organizations by examining why some forms of conflict gain legitimacy over others. We present an ethnographic study of how the staff and management experienced everyday conflict at a Nordic aid agency that highly prized harmony and collaboration in the workplace and had therefore adopted a deliberate and logical approach to conflict. An affective underside of the organization, marked by subtle and suppressed conflict expression, however, alluded to an acknowledged organizational order that guided conflict interaction among members and kept the production together. To explain these organizational dynamics, we use narrative theory as an original and fertile perspective for studying both overt and covert forms of conflict and their interaction. This reveals an important feature of their relationship: they are intertextually linked through their relationship to the dominant organizational identity, which hegemonizes what is and what is not allowed to get into conflict over. From these findings, we develop a model of the structuring of overt and covert conflict through organizational identity, thus contributing to the organizational conflict literature. © The Author(s) 2020.","conflict in organizations; ethnography; narrative theory; organizational identity; power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091348384

According to the initial strategy, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international shipping need to be reduced by at least 50% by 2050, and the CO2 emissions intensity by 40% by the year 2030, both compared to the 2008 levels. In order to achieve these goals, a combination of operational measures, investments in emissions abatement technology, and market-based measures will be necessary. The goals currently do not differentiate among different shipping sectors, and each sector faces different challenges. In this paper, we focus on short sea shipping (SSS), and on Ro-Pax services in particular that in general have not been examined thoroughly in the literature. We examine the emissions reduction potential of several measures, and we assess their efficacy compared with the targets set by the IMO initial strategy. The paper shows that the examined measures are not sufficient on their own to achieve the desired levels of reductions, and that a combination will be necessary, while technological solutions will need to be made more competitive through market based instruments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Energy saving devices; Maritime transport; Ro-Pax shipping; Short sea shipping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091262399

The high volume of fruits produced in the hottest months of the year in a short period causes a high percentage of fruit rot. This is, especially, more challenging for countries with low quality electricity grids, e.g. India. This study proposes the use of in-site off-grid solar-driven cold storage systems integrated with an auxiliary heater for year-round storage of agricultural products (potato in an Indian farming area, just as a reference case). The purpose of the research is to assess which type of solar collector is the best solution from the energy and economic point of view. For this, the required annual cooling load of a 5 TR cold storage of potato is calculated and then, the effect of different types of collectors in heat provision on the performance of the cold supply unit is investigated. The results show that when the system is integrated with PTCs, the performance of the system is much less effective compared to when integrated with ETCs and FPCs. From an energy point of view, FPC, ETC performed at the higher energy efficiency, while in the economic assessments, considering the technical effectiveness of different configurations, an ETC-integrated arrangement reveals the best economical solution with a payback period of 11 years with the storage of 20 tonnes of potato.

We investigated the influence of a climate-smart agricultural production system, namely agriculture organic waste fermentation CO2 enrichment technology (AOWF + CO2) on greenhouse tomato production and the effect of fermentation residues from AOWF + CO2. AOWF + CO2 exhibited positive effect on tomato growth, yield and fruit quality. Soluble sugar, lycopene and carotenoid contents in tomato fruits increased by 24.1%, 53% and 129%, respectively, while the nitrate content decreased by 10.7% when compared with control. The metabolome and proteome studies revealed significant up-regulation of secondary metabolisms, and the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were significantly enriched in purine, pyrimidine and linoleic acid metabolism pathways. The fermentation residues also significantly increased tomato growth, yield and fruit quality. It was estimated that each hectare greenhouse furnished with AOWF + CO2 could at least reduce 17951.5 kg CO2eq. emission, and store 5314.5 kg CO2eq. in soil. In conclusion, AOWF + CO2 and its residues recycling could accelerate tomato growth and productivity.

In this paper, a novel mathematical framework was developed to assess the sustainability of different RE-powered desalination systems, which is very essential for their portfolio selection, by resorting to the fuzzy multi-attribute decision making (MAMD) methods. In the framework, an evaluation system including ten attributes from four dimensions is introduced, while fuzzy triangular numbers and interval values are employed to capture the epistemic and aleatory uncertainties of decision information, respectively. More importantly, three fuzzy MADM methods were proposed in the framework to make the following methodological contributions: (1) fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-based analytic network process (DANP) offers a reliable weighting result by addressing the interrelationships among the attributes; (2) fuzzy full consistency method (FUCOM) can easily but rigorously quantify the qualitative attributes by using the simplified pair-wise comparisons; (3) interval vector-aided technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (VATOPSIS) generates a rational ranking sequence by incorporating the balance among multi-attributes. To illustrate the proposed framework, six RE-powered desalination systems were studied, showing that the solar thermal-powered multi-effect distillation would be the best option under current conditions.

Warning about the perils of imminent mass extinction, climate change communicators are often accused of being unnecessarily ‘doomsday’ in their attempts to foster a sense of urgency and action among the public. Pessimistic messaging, the thinking goes, undermines engagement efforts, straining credulity and fostering a sense of helplessness, rather than concern. Widespread calls for more optimistic climate change messaging punctuate public discourse. This research puts these claims to the test, investigating how affective endings (optimistic vs. pessimistic vs. fatalistic) of climate change appeals impact individual risk perception and outcome efficacy (i.e., the sense that one’s behavior matters). The findings of three online experiments presented in this paper suggest that climate change appeals with pessimistic affective endings increase risk perception (Studies 1 and 2) and outcome efficacy (Study 3), which is the result of heightened emotional arousal (Studies 1–3). Moreover, the results indicate that the mediating effect of emotional arousal is more prevalent among political moderates and conservatives, as well as those who hold either individualistic or hierarchical world views. Given that these audiences generally exhibit lower risk perception and outcome efficacy in relation to climate change, the results suggest that climate change appeals with pessimistic endings could trigger higher engagement with the issue than optimistic endings. These findings are interpreted in light of recent research findings, which suggest that differences in threat-reactivity and emotional arousal may be attributable to brain functions/anatomy mappable to basic motivations for safety and survival. Implications for scholars and practitioners are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090114646

It examines whether, and in what context, licensing agreements function as signals of innovativeness that influence investors' evaluation of public companies and if they are consistent ex post the announcement. Joining the literature on markets for technology and signalling theory, it distinguishes the outcomes related to the expectation and the confirmation of the signal, while investigating the context in terms of a company's analyst coverage. This distinction is addressed based on an empirical strategy that draws on a sample of 99 companies (2006–2012) and relates the investing community's reaction to both abnormal stock market returns in the day of the announcement and to Tobin's q one year after. The results show neither immediate nor ex post effects for outward agreements, and negative immediate and ex post effects for inward agreements, which are muted for companies with extensive analyst coverage. They thus suggest that inward licenses are relevant negative signals and that the value of signals is maintained across time horizons. Our theory development introduces analyst coverage as a contingency under which licensing agreements represent a weaker signal. Our research thus warns managers against publicly announcing their licensing strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Analyst coverage; Firm performance; Inward licensing; Markets for technology; Outward licensing; Signalling theory","Commerce; Investments; Analyst coverages; Innovativeness; Licensing agreement; Market returns; Markets for technology; Performance outcome; Public company; Theory development; Copyrights",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089919145

Document analysis demonstrated how research organizations translated and integrated demands for research integrity measures differently, and interviews explored how department heads made sense of these organizational efforts. Results show that department heads did not seem to use organizational policies in their sensemaking around research integrity. To a much larger degree, they used disciplinary norms, systemic pressures and other cues to construct the meaning of integrity. The heads of department articulated integrity as a “non-problem” in their own local context, rather, it was other departments and other countries that experienced lack of research integrity. This meant that the origin of the problem of integrity is located in the system, but to a large extent the department heads describe the solution of the problem to be in the culture of research.

The words ‘public’ and ‘private’ hold many meanings. This analysis focuses on how they are used both in an informational sense (what is kept secret or strictly controlled versus what is out in the open or shared) and an institutional sense (issues of ownership and purpose such as being state-owned and governed for the common good or privately owned and aimed at generating profit). In the political construction of digital infrastructures, the two senses are deeply intertwined: changes in relation to ownership and purpose affect what is kept secret and what is shared. Furthermore, when policymakers search for ways to protect one aspect (privacy) they sometimes opt for tools from the other (by conceiving of data as private property). The informational interconnectedness facilitated by digital infrastructures produces a form of ‘data promiscuity’. Data promiscuity is a condition where data are indiscriminate in the choice of partners: what is seen as data on a thing for one purpose can always become seen as data on another aspect of that thing and be used for another purpose and by another user. Data are set free to pursue gain or pleasure, but this freedom involves certain dangers for the persons from whom they derive. Data promiscuity is the contemporary condition of possibility for health research. By unpacking the wholesale categories of public and private through which the contemporary situation came about, there is a better chance of rethinking the problems it involves, and for suggesting new solutions to ensure social sustainability. The argument is based on developments in one of the most fiercely digitalised and datafied countries in the world: Denmark. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089687049

Therefore, there seems to be a misalignment in how the role of modular innovation is seen as an innovation management phenomenon and the actual practice of product design and engineering. We revisit the role of modular innovation by combining management and engineering approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach through two cases that utilize patent data of two recent technologically innovative products: Tesla's Model X and iRobot's Roomba automated vacuum cleaner. The examples show, in detail, how the changes in product modules and functions have led to broader changes at the system architecture level, leading to new functionalities.

While this approach has led to valuable insights and has been important to further develop the research field, it provides little information on how to develop frugal innovations. This paper addresses this issue and contributes with an empirical ex-ante examination. This is done by analyzing the design and construction of a frugal technical equipment for Brazilian waste pickers. This newly developed cart was examined to assess its frugality and to derive success factors of the process. Frugality was achieved by decreased product costs of 60%, increased income of the waste pickers by 20% and improved social acceptance of the new equipment. Besides delivering a step-by-step manual on how frugal innovations can be developed, the study contrasted frugal New Product Development (fNPD) with conventional NPD, reconfirmed critical success factors of fNPD from prior research and extends these findings by three aspects: To consider both need identification and need integration in fNPD; To work with tools that allow the frugal reconfiguration of systems on a deep functional level to uncouple fNPD from traditional product notions, and to check cultural impact and societal desirability when organizing the innovation activities.

Digital piracy, the unauthorized copying and distribution of digital products, is therefore an important strategic issue, both because of lost revenues and because it is thought to decrease innovation. Yet, while the latter effect is often argued, empirical evidence is limited. We study whether piracy affects innovation and whether it leads firms to shift to different types of innovations. By studying a large piracy event in a mobile app marketplace, we find that piracy leads to a decrease in the release of incremental innovations, such as bug fixes, but does not decrease more substantial revisions. Additionally, it is associated with subsequent new product development. Managerial Abstract: For many platform companies, a critical issue is understanding how piracy and imitation should be regulated, motivated in part by a common narrative that piracy will eliminate innovation on these platforms. The present article suggests that these effects are slightly more nuanced. We find that piracy does lead to a decline in incremental innovations, such as bug fixes or appearance tweaks, but no discernible decline in more major innovations, such as feature updates or entirely new versions. This implies that piracy can shape the type of innovation, potentially leading to products that are less polished and refined but not affecting the overall level of innovation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","digital innovation; digital piracy; mobile applications; new product development; platforms","Abstracting; Product development; Digital platforms; Digital products; Incremental innovation; Level of innovation; New product development; Strategic issues; Types of innovations; Unauthorized copying; Crime",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088839358

However, supply is not meeting demand. This study asks doctors (physicians): what might encourage you to go into leadership, and what are the disincentives? The same was asked about leadership training. First, the paper tries to understand doctors' motivation to lead, specifically, to explore the job characteristics that act as incentives and disincentives. Second, the study points to organisational obstacles that further shrink the medical leadership pipeline. Method Doctors were surveyed through the Organization of Danish Medical Societies. Our key variables included: (1) the incentives and disincentives for doctors of going into leadership and management and (2) the motivation to participate in leadership training. Our sample of 3534 doctors (17% response) is representative of the population of doctors in Denmark. Findings The main reason why doctors are motivated towards leadership is to make a difference. They are put off by fears of extra administration, longer hours, burnout, lack of resources and by organisational cultures resistant to change. However, doctors are aware of their need for leadership development prior to entering management. Practical implications To improve succession planning, health systems should adapt to reflect the incentives of their potential medical leaders. Leadership training is also essential. These changes are especially important now; medical leaders are linked positively to organisational and patient outcomes and have been central in responding to COVID-19, stress and burnout among clinical staff continues to rise, and health systems face recruitment and retention challenges. © 2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Focus is paid to the differences across the whole production chain between sun-dried clay bricks, which represent the traditional norm, and fired clay bricks, which are the most widely-used walling materials in conventional buildings. A case study was carried out in Dakhla Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt. The results of this study show that if sun-dried bricks are used instead of fired bricks, a reduction of up to 5907 kg CO₂e (in CO₂ emissions) and 5305 MJ of embodied energy for every1000 bricks produced could be achieved. The paper concludes by offering alternative scenarios for brick-making and suggestions for improving sun-dried brick production. The methodology used in this study contributes to the development of an investigative-comparative way to assess choices between building materials. It also intends to help inform local homeowners and building practitioners not only in Egypt, but also globally, about resource depletion, energy consumption, and harmful emissions from fired industrial bricks as a common building construction material. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Carbon life cycle; Cradle to cradle; Embodied energy; Fired clay brick; Sun-dried clay brick","Brickmaking; Carbon; Economics; Energy transfer; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Building construction; Carbon emissions; Comparative studies; Fired clay bricks; Harmful emissions; Industrial bricks; Production chain; Resource depletion; Brick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088391368

MNCs play an important role in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) formulated by the United Nations (UN), as they are responsible for one-third of the total economic output and the majority of world trade. However, little is known about how MNCs contribute to meeting the UN SDGs. Through an in-depth analysis of how Grundfos, a Danish MNC and a leading supplier of pumps, developed a solution for supplying fresh potable water to rural villages in Kenya, we investigate some challenges MNCs face and demonstrate the importance of intimate engagement with the context of strategic action. Tackling sustainable development issues in the context of BoP markets represents a distinctive challenge to MNCs, which often do not have a good understanding of BoP environments. Drawing on contrasting ideas of strategy as navigation or wayfaring, we highlight the dangers of trying to impose existing strategies and business practices in market contexts, which are fundamentally different from existing ones. We add to the existing research by exploring how such frameworks interact with strategizing processes in a novel environment for the operating firm. Specifically, we explore the interrelatedness between planned and emergent approaches to strategizing in BoP market environments. © 2020 The Authors.

We revisit the historical distinction between control and influence by the foreign owner and define ‘controlled’ foreign firms as those with a foreign ultimate owner holding 50% or more of voting shares. Connecting insights from new internalization theory with knowledge-based views of the MNE, we posit that ‘controlled’ foreign firms will generate larger productivity spillovers than non-controlled foreign firms. We use a firm-level panel dataset of 575,844 manufacturing firms (2,343,495 observations) across 20 European countries to test our proposition. We pay careful attention to how firms are categorized as foreign, taking into account both direct and indirect ownership links. Allowing for indirect ownership turns out to be pivotal: there are just as many indirectly controlled foreign firms as foreign firms captured with direct ownership data. We find positive horizontal spillovers from controlled foreign firms and zero spillovers from non-controlled foreign firms. Interestingly, the strongest positive spillovers come from the indirectly controlled foreign firms. The implications of our study extend beyond productivity spillovers to areas such as cross-border M&As, joint ventures, MNE strategies of legitimation, and corporate groups. © 2020, Academy of International Business.","foreign direct investment; history of FDI and the MNE; knowledge and productivity spillovers; new internalization theory; paradox of control; ultimate owner",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088270669

Research often limits examinations of corporate environmental scandals to the primary event announcement. Yet the Dieselgate scandal exhibits a processual character that requires the examination of multiple events over time. We identify 10 Dieselgate events and employ event study methodology to detect abnormal stock reactions. Based on agency and signaling theory, the results indicate that Dieselgate has harmed the stock returns of Volkswagen and its industry peers substantially. Surprisingly, Volkswagen suffered financial damage only upon the initial event of Dieselgate. Subsequent events had significant effects only on industry peers.

Firms influence each other, and the way they reciprocate these influences to cause mutual adjustments is a core feature of industry dynamics. This core feature fundamentally influences risk–return relations. Based on our approach, we develop models that allow us to trace how, at the microlevel, firm conduct in conjunction with competitive interactions generate risk–return relations, and how these are associated with macrolevel measures of industry concentration. That translates into an approach that affords fine-grained predictions of risk–return relations based on the nature of competition in an industry—for example, Cournot or Bertrand—and observations of the industry's competitive intensity and concentration. Managerial Summary: The risk-return trade-off is of critical importance for strategic management. Yet, the relation between industry conditions and the shape of risk-return relations is often unclear. We develop a framework that allows managers to understand how industry conditions generate risk-return relations, and how these can be inferred from macro-level measures of industry concentration. At the micro-level, we show that low variation in operational implementation of strategies may, under some conditions, be associated with high variation as well as high means in financial returns. Our primary insight is that the risk-return trade-off changes with competitive intensity: Starting from industries with two or three firms, we show that increasing competitive intensity – higher number of firms, higher entry and exit barriers – gives rise to a predictable sequence of risk-return relations that change over the life-cycle of industries. Overall, we contribute a framework that allows managers to infer the risk-return trade-off for the industry that their business units are located in. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Bertrand; Bowman paradox; Cournot; firm conduct; industry competition; reflection effect; risk–return","Economic and social effects; Life cycle; Managers; Risk assessment; Business units; Competitive interactions; Financial returns; Fine-grained predictions; Industry competitions; Industry dynamics; Micro-foundations; Strategic management; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087556126

However, existing research has not clearly distinguished between the two liabilities, leaving it unclear how certain determinants differentially affect innovation performance in start-ups relative to older established small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Therefore, in this study we investigate the impact of R&D investments, external knowledge sourcing and public R&D subsidies on innovation effectiveness in new versus older small firms. Employing panel data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey (CIS), we show that R&D investments have a lower contribution to the innovation performance of new ventures, compared to older small firms. In contrast, we find that external knowledge sourcing makes a higher contribution to the innovation performance of new compared to older small firms, but only in high-tech settings. However, we find no support for a differentiating effect of R&D subsidies in new versus established small firms. Effectively, our results highlight the limited effects of internal R&D investments and R&D policy instruments to promote the growth of innovative start-ups, while highlighting potential benefits of their openness to external sources of innovation. As such, these results have important implications for research, practices and policies that relate to innovation in new ventures and SMEs, while casting doubts on the effectiveness of some of the common strategy and policy instruments to stimulate performance in small innovative start-ups. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Entrepreneurship; External Knowledge Sourcing; Open innovation; Public policy; R&D resources; Smes; Spillovers","Engineering; Community innovation surveys; Differentiating effects; External knowledge; External sources; Innovation performance; Policy instruments; Potential benefits; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087183287

However, a contract that is appropriate on average, may be suboptimal for individual managers if heterogeneity in the operating environment creates varying compensation risk. We use field data from a retail firm that introduced an OSFA bonus compensation plan for its store managers. The common bonus formula is based on a weighted sum of objective measures of performance and a subjective rating made by supervisors. The firm intended the supervisors’ discretionary subjective rating to evaluate performance on dimensions that are difficult to measure (e.g., store appearance). We test and find that supervisors give uniformly higher subjective ratings to managers whose objective measure of sales performance is measured with greater noise, and to managers who face higher performance target difficulty, the latter assessed both prior to (ex ante) and subsequent to (ex post) the evaluation period. These results obtain after controlling for manager ability and performance, and for alternative mechanisms to mitigate differences in compensation risk (e.g., salary changes, sales target changes, and bonus adjustments). The evidence suggests that supervisors use discretion in subjective ratings to provide manager-specific risk premiums for non-executive managers who are subject to an OSFA contract. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Compensation risk; Performance measurement; Subjective evaluation; Subjectivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086378760

Nevertheless, it has not been sufficiently quantified in the related literature. This study provides a new metric to quantify the SC resilience by using the stochastic programming. Our metric measures the expected value of the SC's cost increase due to a possible disruption event during its recovery period. Based on this measure, we propose a two-stage stochastic program for the supply chain network design under disruption events that optimizes location, allocation, inventory and order-size decisions. The stochastic program is formulated using quadratic conic optimization, and the sample average approximation (SAA) method is employed to handle the large number of disruption scenarios. A comprehensive computational study is carried out to highlight the applicability of the presented metric, the computational tractability of the stochastic program, and the performance of the SAA. Several key managerial and practical insights are gained based on the computational results. This new metric captures the time and cost of the SC's recovery after disruption events contrast to most of previous studies and main impacts of these two aspects on design decisions are highlighted. Further, it is shown computationally that the increase of SC's capacity is not a suitable strategy for designing resilient SCs in some business environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Conic mixed-integer program; Resilience metrics; Stochastic programming; Supply chain network design","Computer system recovery; Stochastic programming; Supply chains; Business environments; Computational results; Computational studies; Computational tractability; Sample average approximation; Stochastic optimizations; Supply chain network design; Two-stage stochastic programs; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085111493

Researchers and experts imply that industry 4.0 (i4.0) technologies will be exploited by existing firms and new ventures to develop radical business models and market revolutionizing products and services, leading to the disruption of global markets. Additive manufacturing (AM) is currently emerging as one of many disruptive i4.0 technologies. This paper provides the first stepping stone for research into the influence of AM on internationalization in the context of new venturing. Reflecting on current technological trends in the global industrial ecosystem, this paper proposes four themes of particular relevance in guiding future research into the influence of AM on new venture internationalization. Firstly, we indicate that research is needed into the emergence of expert AM service providers and the consequent lurking disruption of the current global value chain. Secondly, we suggest research focused on the role of AM in facilitating increased customer interaction and how this impacts networking, which is a key to early internationalization. Thirdly, we highlight the need for research that acknowledges the current challenges to established legislation and institutions to provide insights into how AM technologies influence international new ventures in the age of i4.0. Fourthly, we propose that research is needed into how AM technologies are used by INVs to overcome and capitalize on regional difference in developing products and services. The paper proceeds to conclude on and summarize these themes. Lastly, further less developed avenues of research are explored. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Internationalization; INV",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079460071

We document that while the proportion of workers using computers has increased from 40 per cent to more than 60 per cent, there remain significant differences between countries even within the same occupations. Several countries have seen a significant increase in computer use even in low-skilled occupations generally assumed to be less affected by technology. Overall, the great increase in computer use between 1995 and 2015 coincided with a period of modest deterioration of job quality in the EU-15 as a whole, as work discretion declined for most occupational and educational groups, while work intensity increased slightly for most of them. Our OLS results exploiting variation within country-occupation cells point to a sizeable positive effect of computer use on work discretion, but to no effect on work intensity. Our instrumental variable estimates point to an even more benign effect of computer use on job quality as measured by work discretion and work intensity. Hence, the results suggest that the (moderate) deterioration in the quality of work observed in the EU-15 between 1995 and 2015 has occurred despite the spread of computers, rather than because of them. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075709626

Coral reef diving tourism is a source of environmental pressure but at the same time represents a source of conservation funding, balancing these pressures. Tailoring the divers' experience to extract increased payments requires insights into the role of diving experiences for willingness to pay (WTP) for the access to dive in the waters surrounding Sipadan. We developed a choice experiment and applied it to a sample of 507 recreational scuba divers at the diving site Sipadan, Borneo in Malaysia. We investigated the role of divers’ most recent and overall diving experiences for their willingness to pay additional diving fees for features related to the conservation status and the diving operations. Results show that a majority of divers prefer lower litter pollution levels in the water and lower density of divers in each dive. When comparing the less experienced divers with the more experienced divers, the latter group express significant preferences over more of the marine biodiversity and recreational attributes of the diving experience. The less experienced group only tended to express significant preferences for fewer of these attributes. We also note that less experienced divers are more likely to have felt crowded and less likely to have seen pelagic species, suggesting, which may, in turn, explain their lower observed WTP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Choice experiment; Conservation through sustainable use; Latent class model; Marine ecosystems; Payment for ecosystem services; Willingness to pay",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072280202

These critical studies have been resolute in concluding that NPM inevitably leads to a degeneration of academics’ ethos and values. Drawing from the moral philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, we argue that these previous analyses have overlooked the moral agency of the academics and their role in ‘moralizing’ and consequently shaping the ethical nature of their practices. The paper provides a new theoretical understanding of NPM-oriented reforms in light of the virtue ethics approach, thereby directing the attention to the moral character and moral agency of academics. Our analysis of interviews collected in the business department of a Danish university provides an example of how individuals have divergent ethical understandings of these structural changes and enact/resist pre-defined social roles in different ways. While in some cases the NPM agenda of the institutions has triggered internal moral conflict and a crisis of moral character, in other cases the new logic resonates with academics’ values and evaluative standards. Partially departing from the theoretical ground of MacIntyre (1981), we conclude that academics can play a crucial role in shaping the morality of NPM-oriented institutions and in transforming these settings into suitable contexts for the cultivation of virtues. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Identity; Moral agency; Moral character; NPM; Performance; University",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067639556

Second, we test the relationship between leadership behaviors and employee job satisfaction using panel data from a year-long randomized field experiment that engaged leaders and employees from hundreds of public and private organizations in Denmark.

The enhancement includes improvements in cell growth, proliferation, and functionalities. The aim of this report is to review the mechanical functionalities of tissue engineering bioreactors in terms of the forms of stimulation, types of stress, actuators, supporting modules, and, most importantly, efficacy. The Google Scholar database was searched for relevant articles. Three forms of simulation were reported: uniaxial, biaxial, and multiaxial. The types of stress exerted by bioreactors include compression, tension, shear, and dynamic stresses, which are applied solely or mutually depending on the number of axes involved. Mechanical stimulation could be actuated by stepper motors, pistons, pneumatic pumps, diaphragm pumps, piezoelectric systems, or dielectric charges. Additional modules, such as incubators, flow perfusion systems, ultrasound sensors, movement controls, and electrodes, can also support the mechanical functions of bioreactors. The efficacy of a bioreactor could be determined by investigating the biomechanical and histological properties of the engineered tissues. To facilitate the development of mechanical functionalities for tissue engineering bioreactors in the future, a seven-step framework is proposed. © 2020. The American Society of Hematology.

The OPC was used in the preparation of bread and pasta and as a substitute for milk in yoghurt resulting in a higher protein content of these foods. The present study showed, that dietary-related GHG emissions and land use can be reduced by substituting animal-based proteins by foods containing oat protein. If the oat protein (OPC) enriched food items substitute animal based protein sources in the diet proportionally, GHG emission from the diet could be reduced by 8% and land use by 14%. However, if the OPC enriched food items are used specifically to replace intake of all beef and some pork, GHG emissions from the diet could be reduced by 13% and land use by 26%. Thereby, use of new plant-based protein ingredients in diets has a considerable potential to mitigate climate change and reduce land use. Even though the presented scenarios are extreme, they clearly demonstrate the potential that OPC food products made it possible to replace some of the animal-based protein with this plant-based protein source. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Diet level; Green house gas emission (GHG); Land use (LU); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Oat protein concentrate (OPC)","Animals; Bakeries; Climate change; Food additives; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Nutrition; Enriched food; Food intake; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); New plants; Protein concentrates; Protein contents; Protein sources; Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088399236

Design/methodology/approach: A trade-off model of transit time and transport costs based on quantitative data from primary and secondary sources is developed to demonstrate the market niche for Eurasian rail freight vis-a-vis the more established modes of transport of sea, air and sea/air. In a scenario analysis, further cargo attributes influencing modal choice are employed to show for which cargo type Eurasian rail freight service is favourable from a shipper's point of view. Findings: At present, Eurasian rail freight is about 80% less expensive than air freight with only half of the transit time of conventional sea freight. Our scenario analysis further suggests that for shipping time-sensitive goods with lower cargo value ranging from $US1.23/kg to $US10.89/kg as well as goods with lower time sensitivity and higher value in a range of $US2.46/kg to $US21.78/kg, total logistics costs of Eurasian rail freight service rail is cheaper than all other modes of transport. Practical implications: As an emerging competitive solution, Eurasian rail freight demonstrates to be an option beneficial in terms of transport cost, transit time, reliability and service availability, which offers a cost-efficient option enabling shippers to build up agile and more sustainable supply chains between China and Europe. Originality/value: Our study firstly provides a comprehensive assessment of present Eurasian rail freight including a thorough comparison with alternative modes of transport from a shipper's point of view. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Belt and road initiative; Cargo value; Container block train; Eurasian land bridge; Service quality; Trans-Siberian railway; Transit time; Transport cost; Value to weight ratio",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086474440

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a thematic review of expatriate research and international business and management literature. The findings are structured through Reiche et al.'s (2019) three-dimensional conceptualisation of global work, after which two frameworks are developed to conceptualise how language connects the three dimensions – actors, structures and processes. Findings: The literature review demonstrates that language-related topics are yet to gain status in the expatriate tradition, and the majority of studies, which do consider linguistic factors appear largely dissociated from the growing community of language research in the broader international management and international business fields. However, once consolidated, the literature reveals that language is present in all dimensions of global work. A processual view of corporate language management highlights the central role of human resource management (HRM), while a dynamic multi-level perspective indicates that language may form bidirectional relationships between the three dimensions of global work. Originality/value: Due to the segmentation between language-sensitive research in the expatriate and international business/management traditions, few studies have considered the HRM implications of global mobility and the multifaceted nature of language at work.

Design/methodology/approach: To identify the factors impacting the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt AI integrated CRM system in Indian organizations helps of literature review and theories have been taken. Thereafter, some hypotheses have been formulated followed by the development of a theoretical model conceptually. The model has been tested statistically for validation using a survey by considering 308 usable respondents. Findings: The results of this study show that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use directly impact the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt an AI integrated CRM system in organizations. Also, these two exogenous factors impact the behavioral intention of the employees to adopt an AI integrated CRM system mediating through two intermediate variables such as utilitarian attitude (UTA) and hedonic attitude (HEA). The proposed model has achieved predictive power of 67%. Research limitations/implications: By the help of the technology acceptance model and motivational theory, the predictors of behavioral intention to adopt AI integrated CRM systems in organizations were identified. The effectiveness of the model was strengthened by the consideration of two employee-centric attitudinal attributes such as UTA and HEA, which is claimed to have provided contributions to the extant literature. The proposed theoretical model claims a special theoretical contribution as no extant literature considered the effects of leadership support as a moderator for the adoption of an AI integrated CRM system in Indian organizations. Practical implications: The model implies that the employees using AI integrated CRM system in organizations must be made aware of the usefulness of the system and the employees must not face any complexity to use the system. For this, the managers of the concerned organizations must create a conducive atmosphere congenial for the employees to use the AI integrated CRM system in the organizations.

To address this gap, we assess the effects of supply chain agility on customer value and customer satisfaction, including the moderating role of customer loyalty, from the perspectives of both business customers (B2B) and end-customers (B2C). Design/methodology/approach: We used multivariate regression analysis to evaluate direct, indirect and conditional effects across survey responses from 148 senior-level supply chain managers (buyers) (Study 1) and 170 end-customers (i.e. consumers) (Study 2). Findings: The results reveal that supply chain agility retains a direct link to both B2B and B2C’ value and satisfaction. However, a higher level of customer loyalty reduces the strength of these relationships, signifying that agility is less important with established customers. In this respect, agility is important to attract new customers, but more agility is not always beneficial once the customer relationship is established. Originality/value: The current study is among the first to examine end-customer response to supply chain agility. The findings complement existing literature by providing novel insights into the impact of supply chain agility on both business customers (B2B) and end-customers (B2C). © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2B; B2C; Loyalty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089145269

There are new technologies that allow value increase through upcycling and waste-to-value production. However, they come at a cost to businesses, and consumers are not necessarily willing to cover these costs. This leads to the question of the right degree and type of transparency in corporate communication: Transparency has shown to increase consumer trust, but the role of disclosing cost is debated in literature. Considering business profitability, the sustainability agenda, and the emerging consumer trend towards plant-based food, we discuss traditional and current upcycling initiatives and our empirical findings on the background of considerations on full or selective information disclosure. We study upcycling for the case of plant-based food product ingredients from side-streams of industrial potato starch production. In three online experiments, we show that a higher degree of transparency in communicating sustainability efforts increases product choice only to a minor degree or even affects it negatively. Fair price perception increases for upcycled alternatives, but only when cost transparency, a specific type of transparency, is disclosed. This leads to a tradeoff consisting of selling either more of the product but for lower price, or less product but at a higher value, that is, more for less or less for more.

Findings suggest that local authorities are beginning to adopt smart technologies and that these technologies are having an unanticipated impact on how public administrators and computational algorithms become imbricated in the delivery of public services.

The results showed that participants were generally positive towards using the SDGs and targets to measure impact and quality of academic research.

However, to date, marketing and sales management literature lacks an understanding of what flexibility in marketing-sales interfaces looks like, its potential organizational consequences, and potential boundary conditions. Using data from interviews with marketing and sales managers, this study explores the nature, outcomes and facilitators of flexibility at the marketing-sales interface. This study conceptualizes marketing-sales interface flexibility (MSIF) as a process of flexible cross-functional resource exchange and finds that MSIF has positive organizational outcomes (both in terms of performance and relationship quality), that MSIF is essential for firms when dealing with exigencies in turbulent environments, and that the utility of MSIF is conditioned by the speed with which MSIF is implemented. The research contribution is twofold. At a theoretical level, the study defines the construct for the first time, revealing MSIF's conceptual composition for examination, and develops theory regarding MSIF's direct relationships with key business outcomes, as well as likely contingencies that shape its importance. At a practical level, the study's framework offers a tool that managers can use to help build organizational success through enhanced flexibility in their marketing-sales interfaces. © 2020","Cross-functional; Flexibility; Intra-organizational; Marketing and sales interface; Marketing and sales resources; Strategic flexibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092501771

A recent Deep Transitions framework has provided a comprehensive theory of the co-evolutionary patterns of multiple socio-technical systems over the last 250 years. However, so far the framework has not been subjected to systematic empirical exploration. In this paper we address this gap by exploring the co-evolutionary model linking niche-level dynamics, transitions in single systems and ‘great surges of development’, as conceptualized by Schot and Kanger (2018) [1]. For this purpose, we conduct a case study on the historical evolution of mass production in the Transatlantic region from 1765 to 1972. Instead of focusing on dominant technologies or common practices the development of mass production is understood as the emergence of a meta-regime, i.e. a set of mutually aligned rules guiding production activities in multiple socio-technical systems. The results broadly confirm the overall model but also enable to extend the Deep Transitions framework by uncovering new mechanisms and patterns in the variation, diffusion and contestation of meta-regimes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Deep Transitions; Great surges of development; Mass production; Meta-regime; Socio-technical transitions","Co-evolutionary; Historical evolutions; Mass production; New mechanisms; Production activity; Socio-technical transitions; Sociotechnical systems; System innovations; Education; coevolution; conceptual framework; industrial history; industrial production; industrialization; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091987034

the robustness of findings in the organizational literature should aim to simultaneously test competing ideas operating in the same theoretical space. In other words, replication efforts should seek not just to support or question the original findings, but also to replace them with revised, stronger theories with greater explanatory power. Achieving this will typically require adding new measures, conditions, and subject populations to research designs, in order to carry out conceptual tests of multiple theories in addition to directly replicating the original findings. To illustrate the value of the creative destruction approach for theory pruning in organizational scholarship, we describe recent replication initiatives re-examining culture and work morality, working parents’ reasoning about day care options, and gender discrimination in hiring decisions. Significance statement: It is becoming increasingly clear that many, if not most, published research findings across scientific fields are not readily replicable when the same method is repeated. Although extremely valuable, failed replications risk leaving a theoretical void— reducing confidence the original theoretical prediction is true, but not replacing it with positive evidence in favor of an alternative theory. We introduce the creative destruction approach to replication, which combines theory pruning methods from the field of management with emerging best practices from the open science movement, with the aim of making replications as generative as possible. In effect, we advocate for a Replication 2.0 movement in which the goal shifts from checking on the reliability of past findings to actively engaging in competitive theory testing and theory building.

Yet, pursuing a solutions strategy can seriously backfire in times of severe crises. The massive economic shock wave brought on by the recent COVID-19 pandemic challenges some of the presumed advantages of business-to-business customer solutions and reveals downsides of these complex offerings to which academics and managers alike may have given insufficient attention. This editorial focuses on goods-centered companies’ recent foray into the solution business and the pressing managerial questions regarding the evolution of solutions as the world begins to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the key characteristics of solution offerings, we identify seven potential downsides of customer solutions that are revealed by the current global crisis and develop promising research avenues mirroring these challenges.

Most importantly, the study examined the moderating role of perceived cultural novelty in the relationship between PA and creativity and its consequences for the indirect association between PA and perceived performance as mediated via creativity. Data from 297 expatriates in Denmark were collected and hypotheses were tested using regression-based analyses. Consistent with predictions, findings showed a positive relationship between PA and creativity. In addition, PA was positively associated with perceived performance. Results of mediation analysis indicated that creativity mediated the effects of PA on perceived performance. While a moderating effect of perceived cultural novelty in the relation between PA and creativity was found, this moderation was in the opposite direction of the postulated hypothesis, i.e. the positive association between PA and creativity was strongly attenuated at high levels of perceived cultural novelty.

Following a design science approach, a conceptual model for LPS adapted to modular offshore wind construction was developed, then refined and evaluated in a field study. The field study investigated was an offshore wind project in the Belgian part of the North Sea. Theoretical knowledge from academics as well as practical experience from field experts allowed adjusting LPS to the context of modular offshore wind construction. The case study organization participated in artifact development and evaluated its utility through implementation. Implementation of the developed artifact reduced the project duration by 21% compared to the as-planned original critical path method (CPM) schedule. Because offshore wind projects have tended to substantially overrun their scheduled durations, 21% may understate the actual improvement. Compared to current installation time within the industry, the project made a 36% reduction, measured by average installation time per megawatt. The developed LPS artifact contributes to the body of knowledge by adaptation of LPS to modular construction, and the evaluation shows its usefulness in the context of modular offshore wind construction. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Application; Design science; Last planner system; Modular construction; Offshore wind project","Modular construction; Turnaround time; Wind power; Body of knowledge; Conceptual model; Critical path method schedules; Installation time; Last planner system; Offshore wind projects; Practical experience; Project duration; Offshore oil well production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090764448

Although researchers have found that outside-in open innovation (OI) has a multitude of positive outcomes (e.g., improved innovation performance), few have studied its antecedents, and especially the “softer” ones. Thus, this study aims to empirically examine three “softer” drivers of outside-in OI (i.e., entrepreneurial culture, OI support, and OI enablement), based on a cross-industry sample of 104 firms. The results show that the relationship between entrepreneurial culture and outside-in OI is fully and positively mediated by OI enablement, whereas the mediating role of OI support in such relationship is not significant. This implies that entrepreneurial culture is unlikely to increase the level of outside-in OI, unless firms enable their employees, through systematic training and the deployment of teams, to effectively gather relevant knowledge from external partners. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Employee enablement; Entrepreneurial culture; External knowledge; Open innovation; Organizational support",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090582348

We draw on stakeholder theory and hybrid organizing to hypothesize that social performance mediates the SEO-financial performance relationship. By analyzing a sample of 1,156 companies, we find that the SEO-financial performance relationship is partially positively mediated by social performance even though the direct effect is negative. Our results show that social performance compensates for the otherwise negative effect SEO has directly with financial performance.

We consider a base specification that includes variables for legal form, region, ownership and industry in all specifications and add variable sets representing firm names, business purpose statements (BPSs) as well as founder and startup characteristics. To forecast the two innovation-related performance outcomes well, we only need to include a set of variables derived from the BPS texts on top of the base variables while an accurate prediction of startup survival requires the combination of the firm names and the BPS variables along with founder characteristics. An accurate forecast of high employment growth needs the combination of the BPS variables and the founder characteristics. All information our forecasts require is likely to be easily obtainable since the underlying information is mandatory to report upon business registration in many countries.

We present a qualitative case study of psychiatric agencies mandated by public policy to collaborate but instead engaged in persistent conflict despite its deleterious effects on their working relationship and on the wellbeing of the clients they intended to serve. To explain these conflictual features of organizing, we integrate Weick’s organizing theory with systems psychodynamics to deepen the understanding of emotions in organizing, specifically the motivational forces underpinning sensemaking and actions between interacting psychiatric agencies. This integration of theories reveals a critical feature of the relationship between the conscious and unconscious organizing processes: When a threat is involved, sensemaking and action are overtaken by social defences, resulting in dysfunctional organizing of the primary task. Drawing on these findings, we enrich Weick’s seminal work by developing a model that portrays organizing as the ritualized interaction of emotions, sensemaking and behavioural responses. © 2020 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","conflict; mental health care; systems psychodynamics; Weick’s organizing model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088129256

Simultaneously, in some countries heating is based on the burning of biomass in individual stoves, which can be considered renewable but results in both inefficient heating and high contamination. In such countries, air pollution or decontamination is a more urgent problem. This paper presents the application of a methodology to analyse how district heating could be used as an important technology for coordinated decontamination and decarbonisation purposes looking towards 2050, based on an energy system analysis using hourly simulations, and using data based on spatial analysis to be able to explicitly include a Chile-specific cost for district heating. The results show that district heating also has the potential to be an important infrastructure to reduce air pollution from biomass combustion for heating, in addition to its better understood role of enabling decarbonisation and energy efficiency. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; District heating; Efficient combustion; Energy system analysis; Smart energy systems","Air pollution; Combustion; Decarbonization; Decontamination; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Biomass combustion; Decarbonisation; Energy system analysis; Hourly simulation; Renewable energies; Spatial analysis; Specific cost; Urgent problems; District heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087944686

We argue that due to migrants’ often different experience from that of native high-skilled workers, their perspectives on problem-solving and access to non-overlapping knowledge networks will also differ. The implied complementarity between these worker types makes migrant hires a particularly valuable resource in the context of firm-level innovation. We refine our diversity hypothesis further by predicting that migrant hires who add to the firm's cultural diversity should contribute more to firm innovation performance than new high-skilled migrant hires who do not add cultural diversity. Finally, we conjecture that firms with high integration capacity as a function of prior experience of employing high-skilled migrants should derive more innovation-related benefits from migrant hiring than firms with a low integration capacity. We track the inward mobility of high-skilled workers empirically using patents and matched employer-employee data for 16,241 Dutch firms over an 11-year period.

More than ever, external stakeholders expect public organizations to “get closer” to users and to treat citizens as knowledgeable consumers of public services with a view and a voice. Existing literature highlights how, through a wide range of calculative practices, information gathered from and about public service users is assembled into descriptions of organizational activity that are useful for managers in addressing issues of surveillance and internal control as well as legitimation. In our multiple case study of hospitals and prisons in Germany, we introduce a two-step model of translation for explaining how user voice is transformed into management objects, which are then further translated into organizationally “useful” information. In doing so, we make three contributions to further our understanding of how user views are formatted to organizational activity and put to use by managers in the public sector. First, we developed a model of translation that highlights how user voices and the prospect of user orientation are enacted across diverse organizational contexts. Second, we found that different types of organizations deploy distinct methods of accounting, which nevertheless make user feedback useful in similar ways: to develop information that helps construct an image of performance, gain financial leverage, and enact compliance. Third, we found that in addition to quantitative forms of accounting, narrative accounting techniques played important roles in making users “useful” in public organizations. © 2020 The Authors.

However, there is scarce empirical research seeking to explain supply chain level factors that enable servitization. Using resource dependence theory, we argue that servitization orientation encourages organizations to enhance supplier, internal, and customer integration (three dimensions of supply chain integration) which in turn enhance servitization (basic and advanced service provision) ultimately affecting firm performance. Covariance-based structural equation modelling is applied to test the hypotheses using data of 307 manufacturing companies obtained from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey. Empirical examination provides evidence that servitization oriented firms enhance internal integration and the integration with key suppliers and customers. However, there is an uneven relationship between firm's integrative practices with suppliers and customers and the provision of basic and advanced services such that enhanced provision of basic services requires more supplier integration while enhanced provision of advanced services requires more customer integration. Also, the performance implications of different types of service provision are found to be unequal. These findings suggest that servitization oriented firms need to improve a specific dimension of supply chain integration to enhance a particular type of service provision. The paper makes an initial attempt to empirically explore the enabling role of supply chain integration in facilitating servitization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Empirical research; Firm performance; International manufacturing strategy survey; Servitization; Supply chain integration","Manufacture; Sales; Supply chains; Customer integrations; Empirical examination; International manufacturing strategy surveys; Manufacturing companies; Structural equation modelling; Supplier integration; Supply chain partners; Supply-chain integration; Integration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084053489

However, its implementation is still a relatively unexplored phenomenon and demands attention. The purpose of this study is to determine the role played by technological context, organizational context, and environmental context of firms in the implementation of the DMTs. A hypothesized model is proposed and tested using survey-based data from the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey VI comprising 931 firms across developed and developing countries. The proposed research model gains support from the technology–organization–environment framework and the combinatorial technology evolution theory, which together provide a holistic understanding of the technology implementation process in terms of its enablers and performance outcomes. We find that although the organizational context and environmental context impact DMTs' implementation, these impacts are mediated through the technological context of the firm. Moreover, the implementation of these technologies has a significant impact on firm performance in terms of flexibility, design, delivery, and quality performance. Contributing to the empirical research gap in the domain of DMTs’ implementation, this study also generates insights for practitioners about the complementarity of the technological, organizational, and environmental factors that together enable the implementation of DMTs and enhance firm performance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Combinatorial Technology Evolution; Digital manufacturing technology; Digitalization; Firm performance; IMSS VI; Technology–Organization–Environment framework","Competition; Developing countries; Surveys; Combinatorial technology; Digital manufacturing; Digitalization; Firm Performance; IMSS VI; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083001721

We argue that neocolonialism – the ethos and practice of colonialism and western superiority in contemporary society – is a means through which identity is worked on at MNC headquarters (HQ). In contrast to extant neocolonial studies of western MNCs, which focus on the subsidiaries (the colonized) and how their identities are shaped by the HQ (the colonizer), we analyse how the HQ is shaped by the subsidiaries. We elucidate two versions of neocolonialism at play: a traditional neocolonial ethos, which prevails at HQ, and a more contemporary version, which is silenced. Our findings show that nurturing a shared and enduring organizational identity across all units of an MNC is a quixotic task. Nevertheless, HQ managers in western MNCs keep attempting to do this, suggesting that neocolonial ethos and practice continue to be relevant in these organizations. © The Author(s) 2020.","corporations; identity; multinationals; neocolonialism; single case study",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081538150

Thus, it aims to explain why coach dismissals have turned into the preferred managerial solution in times of sporting failure. Research methods: Using an institutional logics perspective the paper draws attention to the position of the coach in the organizational setup-up of a club by using qualitative data consisting of semi-structured interviews with Danish sporting directors (n=8). Results and findings: In the football field, three forms of logic blending are identified: a market logic as winning matches and increasing efficiency rather than profit making; emotions as a community legacy; and the marketization of the coaching profession. By integrating a conflict perspective, the paper argues that although clubs are facing logic multiplicity, these logics are compatible resulting in no or little conflict. Implications: The logicś blending means that in times of sporting failure, a coach dismissal has become highly taken-for-granted managerial solution that seems to be accepted, even by the coaches themselves.

Drawing on an understanding of safety as practice, this study attempts to empirically unpack the difference between cooperation as engaging with local knowledges and the disciplining of unsafe behaviour. The research involved an ethnographic study at two large construction sites in Denmark and follows empirical examples of how safety breaches are identified, catalogued, and revealed later on at safety meetings. Managers saw this as an attempt to engage the workers. However, the workers saw this as a punitive way of criticizing their work at a distance. They felt that this practice of moving safety from the construction site and in to meeting rooms ran counter to aims of establishing engaging and effective safety practices close to the work. Efforts to engage workers in safer ways of working should therefore acknowledge the integrated nature of safety practice and the value placed on independence, discretion and negotiation when developing cooperation about workplace safety. © 2020 The Author(s).

First, the study shows that managerial behavior—in the form of performance information use—matters to the way frontline professionals engage in goal-based learning. Second, it shows that the way managers use performance data matters. When managers use data in ways that reinforce the perception of performance management as an externally imposed tool of control, professionals withdraw effort. However, when managers use data in ways that solve organizational problems, professionals engage in goal-based learning.

This paper contributes by exploring the corporate archive as a source of contestation shaped by the varying degrees of power and interest held by key stakeholders.

It does so by: (1) connecting the concept of topology to existing approaches to spatial organization that emphasize its socio-material and open-ended emergence; (2) theorizing organizational space as being in constant deformation across different topological shapes; and (3) exploring this in an empirical example that juxtaposes a management meeting with its interruption. The empirical material is collected through the method of shadowing managers at a Danish school. Theoretically, the paper argues that the shaping of space is contingent upon dis/continuities between (non)human agencies. The topological deformation of space testifies to the continuous but under-acknowledged work provided by (non)human agencies to both achieve and challenge the stability of organizational space. It further situates the boundary between inside and outside as a transient condition. This renders spatial matters such as scale and size situational achievements. Topology thus implies that we cannot in advance scale organization into micro and macro spatialities, and further, foregrounds the inherent dis/organization of space. © The Author(s) 2019.","actor-network theory (ANT); dis/organization; process theory; space; topology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074347273

Using historical analysis, this article reevaluates this de-radicalization thesis, questioning whether corporate social responsibility ever was as inherently radical as the thesis assumes. The article demonstrates that early corporate social responsibility was already invested with a strategy of pragmatism, an investment that traces back to a group of late 19th and early 20th century American Christian reformists, also known as the social gospel movement. They promised that industrialism would unify Christian ethics and capitalist production, thereby reconciling the conflict between profitseeking and social solidarity. The discourse they advanced already contained what would later become key corporate social responsibility components, including (1) the notion of ethical businessmen, (2) the corporation as a morally conscious being and (3) collaboration as the pathway to ‘industrial peace’. Theoretically, the analysis finds inspiration in Luc Boltanski’s and Eve Chiapello’s thesis on modern capitalism’s capacity to assimilate the critiques it faces, supplemented by Michel Foucault’s fine-grained analyses of the transformation and ‘tactical polyvalence’ of discourse. The two positions complement each other in their assumptions regarding the dialectical relationship between capitalism/critique (Boltanski and Chiapello) and power/resistance (Foucault). Tracing the origins of corporate social responsibility’s pragmatism further back in time than the conventional starting point in the 1950s casts new light on the de-radicalization thesis. In particular, corporate social responsibility emphasizes personal ethics as the key to industrial peace, a social gospel legacy that has steered corporate social responsibility away from demands that fundamentally challenge corporate capitalism. © The Author(s) 2019.","Christian ethics; CSR; Foucault; genealogy; new spirit of capitalism; social gospel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074030325

However, due to the distributed nature, insider attacks are still one of the major threats to such IoT environment. How to improve the trust management in IoMT remains a challenge. Motivated by the popularity of blockchain technology, in this paper, our general goal is to investigate the performance of blockchain-based trust management. In particular, we focus on a particular type of IoMT, named medical smartphone networks (MSNs), because of the wide adoption of smartphones in the medical domain. Then, we apply blockchains for enhancing the effectiveness of Bayesian inference-based trust management to detect malicious nodes in MSNs.

The article draws on empirical examples from a multisite fieldwork in six different sites of local community work in Denmark, to demonstrate how different dimensions of translation are involved in shaping active citizenship. We propose the following different dimensions of translation: translating authority, translating language, and translating social problems. The article takes its theoretical point of departure from assemblage urbanism, arguing that cities are heterogeneous assemblages of sociomaterial interactions. Through the practices of translation, local community work both transforms the possibilities for residents and disrupts the compositions of urban assemblages.

In this case, WF owners will take actions to reduce the fluctuation and one of the promising strategies is to integrate battery storage system (BSS) into the WFs. Base on this idea, a novel framework of considering fluctuation penalty (FP) in the Danish spot market which is the electricity market investigated in this study is firstly proposed.

The cooling effect associated with this preheating phase can be utilized to decrease the vessel's overall fuel consumption. Previous works focused on evaluating the prospects for cold energy recovery for specific applications, but failed to provide a detailed overview of the potential uses of liquefied natural gas cold energy recovery on board ships. The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed overview of the potential uses of liquefied natural gas cold energy recovery on board ships, including discussing their prospects in terms of fuel savings and constraints. The evaluations are based on the use of validated numerical models and are carried out for two reference vessels: a ferry featuring a low pressure fuel supply system, and a long-distance containership featuring a high pressure fuel supply system. The results of the study indicate that the greatest fuel savings can be attained when the vessel is powered by a low pressure fuel supply system, reaching up to 2.4%, and that the most promising solution for recovering the cold energy is its use in the organic Rankine cycle unit. The findings of this work provide the scientific basis needed for further research work and the subsequent commercialization of installations of cold energy recovery on ships. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy savings; Engine air cooling; HVAC system; Liquefied natural gas; Organic rankine cycle; Vessel","Cryogenic energy storage; Fuel economy; Fuel systems; Gas fuel purification; Petroleum prospecting; Preheating; Rankine cycle; Recovery; Tankers (ships); Container ships; Cooling effects; Cryogenic conditions; Fuel supply systems; High pressure; Low pressures; Organic Rankine cycles; Scientific basis; Liquefied natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087475325

The use of electric-battery propulsion is a viable solution to reduce the emissions in coastal areas, but it is only applicable to small ferries. Large cruise ships commonly utilize shore power connection to provide onboard electricity, avoiding pollution during harbor stays. However, this solution is not applicable during short stays. This paper presents a novel and energy-efficient way to supply zero-emission power during harbor stays of marine vessels. The proposed system combines the use of a thermal energy storage and a waste heat recovery system based on the organic Rankine cycle technology. The objective of this work is to investigate the technical feasibility of the proposed system and to compare its cost-effectiveness with the alternative solution of using batteries during harbor stays. The study is based on a case study of a hypothetical ferry requiring 1 MW of auxiliary power during harbor stays. The results suggest that the proposed system would require the installation of a storage tank of around 82 m3, and that it could be economically competitive with the battery-based solution, especially when considering its installation on newly built ships. Lastly, it is estimated that the installation of the proposed concept would lead to reduction of the ferry's carbon dioxide emissions by 8%. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery system; Ferry; Organic Rankine cycle; Thermal energy storage; Waste heat recovery; Zero-emission","Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Electric batteries; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Heat storage; Pollution; Ship propulsion; Ships; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Alternative solutions; Auxiliary power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy efficient; Organic Rankine cycles; Pollutant emission; Viable solutions; Waste heat recovery systems; Rankine cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087275306

The replacement levels of SS were 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively. The properties of the PCs, including the compressive strength, the splitting tensile strength and the flexural strength as well as the bulk density, the connected porosity and the water permeability coefficient, were studied. Additionally, the carbonation resistance and the abrasion resistance of the PCs were also evaluated. It is found that the bulk density, the connected porosity and the water permeability coefficient of the PCs increase with SS replacement level overall. Incorporating SS shows positive effects on the development of compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength of the PCs. All the PCs show excellent carbonation resistance. Moreover, the PCs incorporating SS exhibit better abrasion resistance than the control mix. SEM images reveal that the hydrates of cement develop well in the PCs incorporating SS and rather tightly link with SS, compared with the PCs incorporating NA. The formation of a significant amount of CaCO3 is observed after carbonation.

Using ethnographic research in two branches of public administration, the study highlights how frontline workers act in accordance with seemingly contradictory modes of ordering. Their acts problematize linear conceptualizations of change that often prevail in digital reforms. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a comparative ethnographic study of frontline workers in the Danish tax and customs administration and municipal citizen service centers. The concept of modes of ordering is used to highlight new tensions that arise as frontline workers adapt to make digital reforms work. Findings: Frontline workers act according to two different modes of ordering based on the separation between helping citizens help themselves and helping citizens directly. National policies and strategies promote the underlying rationale of the first mode but, as this paper shows, this mode is sustained by a second mode, which involves the intervention of professionals when citizens cannot be helped to help themselves. Originality/value: The paper, which contributes to our understanding of how digitalization is changing public administrations and the relationship between frontline workers and citizens, challenges applying a linear, technocratic focus in discourses on public sector digitalization and highlights the contradictory practices of frontline work. It demonstrates the necessity of going beyond policy narratives and calls for increased attention to how frontline workers adapt to make reforms work. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digitalization; Discretion; Ethnography; Frontline work; Modes of ordering; Public sector reform",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082877247

To tackle data sparsity and cold start problems in recommender systems, researchers propose knowledge graphs (KGs) based recommendations by leveraging valuable external knowledge as auxiliary information. However, most of these works ignore the variety of data types (e.g., texts and images) in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). In this paper, we propose Multi-modal Knowledge Graph Attention Network (MKGAT) to better enhance recommender systems by leveraging multi-modal knowledge. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal graph attention technique to conduct information propagation over MMKGs, and then use the resulting aggregated embedding representation for recommendation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that incorporates multi-modal knowledge graph into recommender systems. We conduct extensive experiments on two real datasets from different domains, results of which demonstrate that our model MKGAT can successfully employ MMKGs to improve the quality of recommendation system. © 2020 ACM.","graph convolutional networks; multi-modal knowledge graph; recommender systems","Information dissemination; Knowledge representation; Online systems; Recommender systems; User experience; Auxiliary information; Cold start problems; Different domains; External knowledge; Information explosion; Information propagation; On-line applications; Quality of recommendations; Knowledge management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095865645

How should we select such inherent content features of a message emanating from a given set of nodes, so as to engender high influence spread over the network? This influential feature set selection problem has received scarce attention, contrary to its dual, influential node set selection counterpart, which calls to select the initial adopter nodes from which a fixed message emanates, so as to reach high influence. However, the influential feature set selection problem arises in many practical settings, where initial adopters are given, while propagation depends on the perception of certain malleable message features. We study this problem for a diffusion governed by a content-aware linear threshold (CALT) model, by which, once the aggregate weight of influence on a node exceeds a randomly chosen threshold, the item goes through. We show that the influence spread function is not submodular, hence a greedy algorithm with approximation guarantees is inadmissible. We propose a method that learns the parameters of the CALT model and adapt the SimPath diffusion estimation method to build a heuristic for the influential feature selection problem. Our experimental study demonstrates the efficacy and efficiency of our technique over synthetic and real data. © 2020 ACM.","content-awareness; influence maximization; linear threshold","Approximation algorithms; Heuristic methods; Knowledge management; Estimation methods; Feature selection problem; Greedy algorithms; Influential nodes; Inherent characteristics; Linear threshold models; Selection problems; Synthetic and real data; Feature extraction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095864856

Yet, existing datasets only provide explicit ratings on items and no information is provided about users' opinions of other (non-recommendable) entities. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new dataset, called the MindReader dataset, providing explicit user ratings both for items and for KG entities. In this first version, the MindReader dataset provides more than 102 thousands explicit ratings collected from 1,174 real users on both items and entities from a KG in the movie domain. This dataset has been collected through an online interview application that we also release as open source. As a demonstration of the importance of this new dataset, we present a comparative study of the effect of the inclusion of ratings on non-item KG entities in a variety of state-of-the-art recommendation models. In particular, we show that most models, whether designed specifically for graph data or not, see improvements in recommendation quality when trained on explicit non-item ratings. Moreover, for some models, we show that non-item ratings can effectively replace item ratings without loss of recommendation quality.

However, to assess the contribution of IT to value with respect to the contribution of complementary resources, it is crucial to understand the means by which IT creates value. Design/methodology/approach: This paper synthesizes empirical research on the inherent capabilities of IT and their moderating role to build an integrative model. Findings: We found that IT creates value through three inherent capabilities: transactional, exchange and codification capabilities. These capabilities can be regarded as moderators of the relationship between IT and competitive advantage. This moderating role of IT in competitive positioning is illustrated by examples from previous empirical publications. Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to IT business value (ITBV) literature by developing an integrative model that (1) conceptualizes an aspect of IT value creation, which, thus far, has received only limited attention (namely, inherent capabilities) and (2) illustrates the moderating role of these capabilities in competitive positioning. Practical implications: Inherent capabilities provide the theoretical foundation for a nuanced understanding of IT contribution with respect to complementary resources. This understanding may support IT executives in deriving adequate measurements and, thus, account for the differential effects of IT. Originality/value: Compared to the literature, the proposed model represents a more coherent and holistic perspective of ITBV. Thus, the model may constitute a foundation for future ITBV research and promote more detailed analytic perspectives of ITBV. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business value; Competitive advantage; Information technology; Inherent capabilities; Value creation","Industrial engineering; Industrial management; Competitive advantage; Competitive positioning; Design/methodology/approach; Differential effect; Holistic perspectives; Integrative modeling; Limited attentions; Theoretical foundations; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090948478

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing parallels between Norbert Elias' figurative account of social life and auto-ethnographic methodology, this paper re-articulates the entanglement of social researchers in organizational ethnographic work. Auto-ethnographic narration is explored as means to inquire from within the emerging relational complexity constituted by organizational dynamics. Writing about emergent events in the research process becomes a way of inquiring into the social figurations between the involved stakeholders; thus nurturing sense-making and increasing the awareness and sensitivity of the researcher to her own entanglement with the relational complexity of the organization under study. Findings: In the paper, we argue that the writing of auto-ethnographic narratives of emergent field encounters is a process of inquiry that continuously depicts the temporal development of the relational complexity in organizations. Viewing that from the perspective of Elias' concept of figuration, we find a common commitment to the processual nature of research processes, which insists on moving beyond objectifying empirical insights. Originality/value: This paper encourages awareness of the interdependency between ourselves as social researchers and field actors as we engage with the field. It moves beyond simplifying the ethnographic research agenda to that of “studying” and “describing” organizations. It offers unique insights into the organizational context, and increased sensitivity toward the social entanglement of the experiences that we, ourselves, as researchers are part of. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Figuration; Interdependency; Organizational ethnography; Process theory; Reflexivity; Relational complexity; Writing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089257314

Design/methodology/approach: Using a practice-based framework, the article utilizes a case study of the first legal meeting between a lawyer and a woman who has experienced violence. The case study illustrates how the legal advisors' expertise is deployed in the use of “discursive practices” in dealing with women who have experienced domestic violence. Through a systematic analysis of the verbatim narrative, the case shows how the lawyer performs her legal help through expert “discursive practices” which are situated in recognition of the texture of practices experienced by women in the legal system. Findings: The case study shows how a practice-based approach is able to account for lawyers' discursive and interactional knowledge in dealing with domestic violence. This expert doing and saying includes the ability to read the complexities of abusive situations, using “professional vision” to identify, highlight and codify clues and patterns of a partners' violent behavior; the mastery of “co-implication” with women to support the development of a narrative of the abuse as a crime recognizable both by the victim and the legal system. Originality/value: The analysis shows that practice-based approaches to knowing and learning in investigating discourse practices can provide insights on practitioners' interactional expertise as well as the relevance of the service. While a close look at the actual practices illustrates the lawyer's interactional mechanisms, the crucial role of legal aid in the antiviolence center can be appreciated by contextualizing within the texture of practices that characterizes women's experiences with violence. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discursive practices; Domestic violence; Gender-related violence; Knowing-in-practice; Legal advisor; Practice theory; Zooming out",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088560800

In particular, increasing customer retention and preventing customers from replacing the adopted SaaS applications has become a crucial task for all SaaS vendors. In this study, using a mixed-methods approach, and drawing on the cognitive-affective-conative-action (CACA) framework, we investigate the IS replacement phenomenon in the context of SaaS-delivered applications. Our qualitative study allows us to develop an IS-centric view of customer commitment by differentiating between organizations' commitment to the SaaS application and to the cloud computing technology in general, while the subsequent quantitative study validates the difference between the two types of commitment and helps understand how they together influence organizations' intentions to replace a SaaS application.

The paper first presents a literature review and based on this, aspects of shop floor digitalisation supporting operators in enhancing the diagnosability are identified and synthesized in a 3-e model (error reduction, ergonomics, and easiness). Secondly, insights from a case study are interpreted through the literature-based model in order to both consolidate the theoretical results and emphasize the implications for practitioners.

In this endeavor, eco-efficiency is considered as one of the key concept to facilitate the successful transition to the sustainable development with the focus to reduce the ecological impact of industry through efficiency improvements. The shipping industry is largely involved in this challenge with a target set by International Maritime Organization to cut emissions from individual ships by 40% from 2008 levels by 2030. The ship loading process is believed to have great impact to the overall eco-efficiency as it is not only a time consuming process but also determines the fuel consumption of the transportation. In this study, we aim to incorporate virtual reality (VR) technology and gamification theories to raise the eco-efficiency awareness in the shipping loading process. A VR application for ship loading process was developed using a real world case in the Baltic sea region. Eco-efficiency concept is introduced in different levels based on the gamification theories. Maritime professionals tested the VR application and provided their feedback. The results are positive that combining VR and gamification can be useful to train operators with eco-efficiency in the ship loading operations.

A promising tool to address these challenges could be the application of biochar, a carbonaceous product of biomass pyrolysis. The efficiency of biochar could be improved through physical, chemical and microbial procedures. Engineered biochar could then be applied for various applications ranging from sustainable agriculture to pollution remediation and catalytic reactions. Biochar engineering allows achieving biochar properties which are optimum for specific applications and/or under specific conditions. This would lead to harnessing the favorable features of biochar and to enhance its efficiency while simultaneously minimizing the existing tradeoffs. This review covers the production and applications of engineered biochar by summarizing great deals of research and knowledge on the field. Unlike previous reviews, herein biochar physical and chemical properties and the factors affecting them (i.e., biomass nature and pyrolysis conditions) have been discussed in detail.

To attain this aim, the present study uses hybrid Multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) and has identified 15 adoption IoT Barriers (IoTBs) from literature review obstructing the IoT implementation in smart cities of India. The IoTBs are further analyzed through the Total Interpretative structural modeling (TISM) approach, the Fuzzy Matriced'Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliquéan Classement (MICMAC) model, and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The TISM approach is used to develop a structural framework of IoTBs in smart cities’ waste management (SCWM) projects. The literature shows that several bottlenecks exist. Such bottlenecks may include operational cost and payback; a lack of standardization, regulations, directions, and policy norms; incomplete technical knowledge among policymakers; internet connectivity, privacy, and security issues; or problems with mobility, transparency, and a lack of IT infrastructure; all of these issues influence IoT adoption in SCWM. The present work discloses that the lack of regulations, directions, and policy norms, and the lack of standardization and Internet connectivity are the most critical IoT barriers hindering the development of smart cities, particularly in their waste management practices. The Fuzzy-MICMAC approach is useful in calculating driving and dependence powers of the IoTBs, and the DEMATEL method helps reveal the influence/strength of IoTBs that affect SCWM. This study will help policymakers, stakeholders, and government to understand the significant IoTBs affecting waste management practices, and it will definitely assist them to undertake decisions for eradicating these barriers for a more efficient IoT implementation in SCWM projects. © 2020","DEMATEL; Fuzzy MICMAC; IoT barriers; MCDM methods; Smart cities; TISM; Waste management","Decision making; Smart city; Standardization; Waste management; Decision making trial and evaluation laboratories; Internet connectivity; Internet of thing (IOT); Internet of Things (IOT); Interpretative structural modeling; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Waste management practices; Waste management systems; Internet of things",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087764176

Therefore, the recycling of wool waste is of increasing concern and is an important tool for environmental protection and resource-efficient utilization. In this study, an eco-friendly process ensuring complete recycling of wool waste was developed using glutathione as a reducing agent. First, the main component keratin, which is an important source of renewable biomaterial, was extracted. Keratin products were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The results indicated that glutathione treatment could cause approximately 65% weight dissolution in wool, and keratins with molecular weights of 26, 44, and 66 kDa could be obtained. Furthermore, the residues were collected and prepared as sponges. These sponges showed an excellent adsorption capacity for cationic dye methylene blue (MB). In conclusion, sustainable wool waste recycling coupled with the cleaner production of keratins and a new adsorbent was achieved; this method can turn “waste” into “wealth” and solve the environmental pressures caused by waste. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate the usefulness of glutathione in an ecofriendly process for the extraction of keratin from wool. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Decolorization; Full recycling; Glutathione; Keratin; Wool wastes","Aromatic compounds; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dichroism; Environmental protection; Infrared spectroscopy; Keratin; Peptides; Pollution control; Recycling; Textile industry; Waste utilization; Wool; Adsorption capacities; Cationic dyes; Cleaner production; Eco-friendly process; Environmental pressures; Environmental problems; Glutathiones; Resource-efficient; Yarn",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086467399

Design/methodology/approach: Using interdisciplinary insights from competition policy and business strategy, the paper draws attention to the interplay between business model innovation and merger control in the converged telecoms sector. Findings: Technological innovation and business model innovation led to the emergence of over-the-top (OTT) services. This innovation in turn led to two key effects, first, successful commercialization of content and the emergence of the “smart pipes” that in turn has led to the second effect, which is increased mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in the converged telecommunications sector. Emergence of OTT with big data as a key advantage challenged the strategy and business models of the more established players, such as the AT&T, Time Warner, Liberty Global and Fox, which in turn led to the current trend of M&As in the sector. Originality/value: This paper makes the following key contributions to the literature on M&As between the fixed/mobile and content players. First, it elucidates how the existing market players can benefit from competition policy, such as merger remedies to enter new and related markets. Second, it advocates that the US and the European competition authorities while assessing these M&As, take due account of innovation in business models, as business model innovation not only promotes innovation in the market but also enhances consumer welfare, considering that it offers the merged firm economies of scale and scope to offer better-quality goods and services at subsidized prices. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","AT&T/Time Warner; Business model innovation; Business models; Converged telecoms; Fixed/mobile and content integration; Liberty global/ Ziggo; Merger control; Merger remedies; Over-the-top services; Sustainable competitive advantage",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066993111

Polycythemia vera (PV) is an example of such a disorder characterized by excessive production of erythrocytes and the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation. A 5D PV model with competing healthy and malignant cells, including erythropoietin (EPO), is proposed and analyzed. The production of EPO is governed by the number of erythrocytes, while EPO influences the proliferation and death rate of erythrocytes. Stem cell dynamics can be independently analyzed as a two-dimensional system. A numerical analysis shows that steady states and their stability of the 2D stem cell PV submodel are in agreement with the PV model. Combining the model with data of PV patients, we demonstrate the model's prognostic significance. It follows that an efficient treatment must target stem cell properties such as the bone marrow microenvironment and stem cell death rates. © 2021 System Dynamics Society. © 2021 System Dynamics Society",,"blood; cancer; cell; health risk; modeling; mutation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102500103

Depending on the final design of the rules, it is concluded that the proposed income inclusion rule – however, probably not the switch-over rule – may end up restricting the fundamental freedoms by treating comparable situations differently.

Less is known about the potential downsides associated with citizen participation in coproduction of public services. We argue that psychological costs, such as experiences of stigma, stress, and loss of autonomy may arise among citizens in response to coproduction initiatives stimulated or directly imposed by public organizations. We test our propositions in two randomized vignette experiments on a representative sample of Danish citizens. First, we manipulate whether citizens are encouraged to coproduce public services yielding private or collective benefits. Second, we induce perceived self-efficacy among a subsample of citizens. We find that citizens are more likely to experience psychological costs when they are encouraged to coproduce public services resulting in private benefits for relatives or friends in contrast to collective benefits for a larger group of people. Furthermore, these psychological costs are felt to a greater extent among citizens with low self-efficacy. Fusing insights from multiple perspectives, our study pushes the theoretical frontiers of coproduction literature by illustrating how complex emotional responses is an overlooked, but integral part of a more comprehensive theory on the manifestations and effects of citizen coproduction. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This has and will presumably have a serious impact on both employees and employers, which still needs to be clarified and investigated: indeed, if smart working becomes a common working modality, this may have a significant impact on both organizations and employees. This paper reports the results of an online survey of “smart workers” in Italy during the COVID pandemic, when a great number of employees suddenly moved to working from home with no or little preparation. The study offers interesting indications about the involvement and usefulness perception of smart working by the sampled people and makes it possible to single out different categories of employees based on their attitude towards this modality. Also, it points out the potential impact on socialization among colleagues, and the consequent implications for knowledge sharing and knowledge management. From the collected responses, a fully positive or negative conclusion about working from home was not possible, nor a clear indication about the efficiency and effectiveness of this working modality. The analysis, instead, highlighted the presence of different but numerically similar groups of people, i.e. those who were not satisfied at all with the experience, those who were very satisfied, and those who were “undecided”. Furthermore, respondents underlined the importance and the difficulty to maintain working contacts and the intense use of communication systems made for this purpose. Lastly, collected opinions on positive and negative aspects of working from home provided some practical suggestions about how to successfully implement this solution. © 2020 Sciendo.

Its emphasis upon adoption of a positive mind-set and ‘good’ lifestyle choices has resulted in active ageing policies becoming associated with ‘neoliberal’ tendencies. Conversely, we suggest the tendency to equate active ageing policy with a totalising concept of ‘neoliberalism’ can obscure interpretational nuance. We conducted Foucauldian Discourse Analysis upon 31 policy documents outlining provision of active ageing services in Copenhagen Municipality, Denmark, traditionally a communitarian policy environment. Both textual and visual data were analysed. Focus was made upon the construction of active ageing as an object of policy, and subsequent discursive constructions of the active ageing subject. The application of ‘active ageing’ created several contradictions in this policy environment. Services were promoted as ‘open to all,’ yet Municipal support was discursively constructed as an imperative of care for the most needful. Personal choice was promoted, yet meaningfulness and freedom was situated in the community, and shared-ownership, active citizenship and voluntarism were emphasised. The older subject was discursively constructed as an ethical, responsible, self-sufficient and active citizen who was both a producer and consumer of active ageing programmes. Such subjects were imagined to inhabit localised communities of primarily white, slim, non-disabled, visibly happy and healthy over-65 year olds. Hence, whilst empowerment and programme flexibility were promoted, the conceptualisation of a homogenous ‘elderly’ community appeared less conducive to respect for diversity, promoting cross-generational cooperation and maximising the ‘preventative’ potential of active ageing programmes. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Active ageing; communitarianism; discourse analysis; Foucault; meaningfulness; physical activity promotion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094171907

A key rationale behind this decision was that it would not be financially feasible to bribe a majority of the congress. However, the network structure with asymmetries of influence can still be susceptible to corruption. The aim of this study is therefore to analyse the potential susceptibility of the organisation structure to a grand vote-rigging corruption scheme of FIFA World Cup host elections by means of a social network analysis approach. Based on a theoretical notion of vote mobilisation and inter-organisational networks, the organisational structure is evaluated to identify potential susceptibility to corruption. Two possible regimes were analysed, the centrally controlled and horizontally controlled, based on structural cohesion, embeddedness, network centralisation and correlation between actor centrality distributions. Findings do not suggest a susceptibility to a centrally controlled, but to a horizontally controlled vote-rigging corruption scheme. After the social network analysis was conducted, the holders of five out of eleven of the identified vulnerable positions in the network have been charged with allegations of corruption. This is a strong indicator of the validity of the method to assess the structural susceptibility to corruption. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","corruption; governance; interorganisational networks; organisational structure; Power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092766378

Achieving both objectives simultaneously, however, is difficult because procurement contracts require a trade-off between providing incentives for efficiency and facilitating adaptation. In the presence of formal contracts that provide strong incentives for efficiency, ensuring adaptation thus requires effective relational contracts between the buyer and the supplier. But because the focus of prior research has been on dyadic buyer-supplier relationships, it is unclear how the efficiency-adaptation trade-off can be mitigated in the multitier supplier systems that are common in many industries. Addressing this gap, we argue that in hierarchical supplier systems, relational contracts between contractual partners become more important, but at the same time harder to establish, than in single-tier supplier systems. An in-depth case study of the adaptive frictions that arose in the Airbus A350 program allows us to illustrate this challenge of tiered outsourcing. Moreover, we show how Airbus came to resolve the frictions by leveraging skip-level ties-direct informal contacts to lower-level suppliers with which no contractual relationship existed, thus replacing the archetypal notion of a supplier hierarchy by a more complex relationship structure. We discuss the boundary conditions of our findings and suggest propositions for the emergence of skip-level ties in tiered outsourcing. © 2020 INFORMS.","Adaptation; Buyer-supplier relationships; Complex systems; Incentives; Multitier supply chains; Outsourcing; Product design; Relational contracts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092274765

Thus, we develop and implement a framework to analyze the systemic impacts of future urban mobility trends and policies. We build on prior work in classifying the world's cities into 12 urban typologies that represent distinct land-use and behavioral characteristics by introducing a generalized approach for creating a detailed, simulatable prototype city that is representative of a given typology. We then generate and simulate two auto-dependent (largely US-specific) prototype cities via a state-of-the-art agent-based platform, SimMobility, for integrated demand microsimulation and supply mesoscopic simulation. We demonstrate the framework by analyzing the impacts of automated mobility on-demand (AMoD) implementation strategies in the cities based on demand, congestion, energy consumption and emissions outcomes. Our results show that the introduction of AMoD cannibalizes mass transit while increasing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) and congestion. In sprawling auto-dependent cities with low transit penetration, the congestion and energy consumption effects under best-case assumptions are similar regardless of whether AMoD competes with or complements mass transit. In dense auto-dependent cities with moderate transit modeshare, the integration of AMoD with transit yields better outcomes in terms of VKT and congestion. Such cities cannot afford to disinvest in mass transit, as this would result in unsustainable outcomes. Overall, this framework can provide insights into how AMoD can be sustainably harnessed not only in low-density and high-density auto-dependent cities, but also in other typologies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based simulation; Automated mobility-on-demand; Future urban mobility; Prototype cities; Urban typologies","Energy utilization; Land use; Behavioral characteristics; Implementation strategies; Large-scale agent-based simulations; Mesoscopic simulation; Microsimulation; On-demand services; State of the art; Sustainable solution; Traffic congestion; computer simulation; mass transport; mobility; traffic congestion; urban area; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089910847

Our experiment assesses Weberian relative to managerial approaches to recruitment, job stability, and pay. We argue that in developing countries with institutionalized corruption and weak rule of law—yet not OECD countries without such features—“unprincipled” principals use managerial discretion over hiring, firing, and pay to favor “unprincipled” bureaucratic agents who engage in corruption. Our results support this argument: managerial practices are associated with greater bureaucratic corruption in our surveyed developing countries, yet have little effect in our OECD country.

Danish dress culture is particularly informal, brought on by international tendencies towards casual dressing but also by local cultural and geographical conditions that tend to call for functional dress practice. The study is based on interviews with men living in Denmark who wear the tie as a fashion accessory rather than as part of a uniform or according to workplace dress codes. A key finding in the article is the role the tie plays in dressing up as both a social distinction marker and a vehicle for emotional empower-ment and physical comfort. The tie is widely considered an icon of western culture and therefore the reclaiming of the tie is also seen as a reaction to a shift towards casual dressing within the western fashion system.

We then stress-test this knowledge with managerial practices by conducting an online survey of 169 managers, designed to establish the repertoire of current and future marketing capability needs of industrial firms. Herein, we identify two marketing capabilities gaps: the practice gap—which identifies the deficit between managers' ‘current’ practices and their ‘ideal’ digital marketing capabilities; and, the knowledge gap—which demonstrates a significant divide between the digital marketing transformations in industrial firms and the extant scholarly knowledge that underpins this.

The paper conceptualizes SI as changing social relations, involving new ways of doing, knowing, framing and organizing, and theorizes transformative social innovation (TSI) as the process of SI challenging, altering, or replacing dominant institutions in a specific social-material context. Three advances towards TSI theory are proposed. First, we reflect epistemologically on the challenges of theory-building, and propose an appropriate research design and methodology. Middle-range theory is developed through iteration between theoretical insights and comparative empirical study of 20 transnational SI networks and about 100 associated initiatives. Second, we synthesize various innovation theories and social theories into a relational framework that articulates the distributed agency and institutional hybridization involved. Third, we formulate twelve propositions on the emergence of SI initiatives, on the development of SI ecosystems, on institutionalization processes, and on the historical shaping of SI. The paper ends with a critical assessment of the advances made, also identifying further challenges for TSI theory and practice. © 2020","Empowerment; Innovation process; Institutional change; Relational theory; Social innovation; Transformative change","Engineering; Critical assessment; Distributed agencies; Empirical studies; Innovation research; Innovation theory; Middle-range theory; Social innovations; Theory and practice; Iterative methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088382451

Past research assesses the efficacy of category captaincy from a retailer perspective, with results showing effective categorycaptain arrangements depend on the respective abilities of actors to effectively operate in such a network structure. Less is known about what and how manufacturers become successful captains or how challenger manufacturers unseat an incumbent captain. With this research, we contribute to the growing but still small literature on category captaincy in two main ways. First, we re-orient the focus from the retailer to the manufacturer (both captain and non-captains) to uncover the enabling strategies and underlying capabilities captains and non-captains require when operating in category captaincy networks. Second, we contextualize the captaincy lifecycle in terms of three stages; consideration, captaincy, and renewal. Drawing on interviews with retailers, category captains, and non-captains from six sectors we develop propositions whereby capabilities are contingent on actor goals across the captaincy lifecycle. In so doing, we extend existing research by identifying the capabilities necessary for different actors to gain benefits from category captaincy arrangements. © 2020","Category captaincy; Category management; Enabling strategies; Strategic enablement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088377764

We test and find support for our predictions in a series of four studies that include real-world Twitter data after a series of terrorist attacks in 2016–2017, and three experimental studies conducted online and in the field with behavioral measures after Day of the Dead and during COVID-19 pandemic.

We demonstrate that a different path to outsourcing originates from critical internal resource shortages. These shortages pose a critical dilemma; on the one hand outsourcing is a reasonably durable approach to solving resource shortages. On the other hand, the same resource shortages complicate the management of outsourcing and may create knowledge and evaluation problems. We empirically examine this dilemma and thereby add to the limited work on the enabling effects of outsourcing under resource constraints. We employ two rich and unique panel datasets of Australian firms observed over five-year periods, to test dynamic change models if firm-level financial and competence constraints induce outsourcing, and if this in turn enables internal process improvement. The results show that outsourcing indeed is associated with both financial and competence constraints, although the impact of these constraints differs over time. In turn, we find that increased outsourcing relates positively to contemporaneous and future process improvement. These findings thus shed a positive light on how outsourcing can enable firms to overcome constraints and realize internal process improvement. © 2020 The Authors","Competence constraints; Enablement; Financial constraints; Outsourcing; Process improvement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088018848

This study examines how performance information influences frontline employees' support for managerial policy initiatives. We develop hypotheses stating that the exposure to positive and negative organizational performance scores compared to average scores increases frontline employees' support for managerial policy initiatives and thus facilitate policy change. To test our hypotheses, we conduct a survey experiment on more than 1,500 social caseworkers working in Danish employment agencies. The results show that while the provision of positive organizational scores increases caseworkers' support for managerial policy initiatives, there is no direct effect following the exposure of negative performance scores. However, additional exploratory analysis reveals that the caseworkers' experienced work pressure moderates the effect of positive and negative performance information. Specifically, caseworkers that experience a high work pressure are more inclined to support managerial policy initiatives following positive and negative performance scores. Furthermore, the explorative analysis indicates that the caseworkers tend to ignore negative performance information, which strongly suggests that poor performance scores trigger identity-protective cognition. Overall, the study advances our understanding of the link between performance information and support of policy changes on the frontline of public services by showing how different performance scores influence employees' support for managerial policy initiatives. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Social networks composed of relatives, friends or acquaintances can facilitate access to employers and thereby enhance labour market integration. However, when labour markets are segmented, (co-ethnic) social networks might also contribute to locking migrants into sectors and occupations characterised by high migrant shares, increasing the probability of a mismatch between skills and occupations. Drawing on data from the special module on migrants and their descendants in the 2014 European Labour Force Survey, this article considers subjective and objective overqualification. The analysis reveals that finding jobs through social networks bears a higher risk of overqualification in general, and especially for recent Central Eastern European migrants. The results point to a complex relationship between social-network job search, sectoral segmentation and destination-country language proficiency. © The Author(s) 2020.","CEE migrants; EU-LFS data; intra-EU labour mobility; job search; language skills; objective overqualification; sectors; segmentation; social networks; subjective overqualification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087453813

In this study, six cases of blockchain-based technologies in the food supply chain were analyzed applying a technology assessment framework that distinguishes between four different components of a technology: technique, knowledge, organization, and product. The study intends to provide new critical insights on how blockchain-based technologies can be implemented in the food supply chain and to further the discussion of social and environmental implications of blockchain-based technologies. The results highlight how blockchain is not a stand-alone-technology, but rather one element in a system of technologies. While blockchain-based technologies are expected to bring a variety of impacts, only some are directly attributable to the blockchain element: increased transparency, traceability, and trust. Other impacts such as improved data management are a side-effect of digitizing non-digital processes.

This paper offers an alternative framework that focuses on the role of suppliers of goods and services (the “supply chain economy”) in national performance. We identify three conceptual attributes of suppliers that make them important for innovation: they produce specialized inputs; have more downstream linkages with other industries; and benefit especially from co-locating with their customers, creating externalities. Using the 2002 Benchmark Input-Output Accounts, we estimate a new industry categorization that separates supply chain (SC) industries (i.e., those that sell primarily to businesses or government) from business-to-consumer (B2C) industries (i.e., those that sell primarily to consumers). We find that the supply chain economy is a distinct and large segment of the economy that includes primarily service providers. The SC industries, especially traded services, have higher average wages than B2C industries. The supply chain economy also has higher innovative activity as captured by the concentration of the vast majority of STEM jobs (primarily in traded services) and patents (in manufacturing). Finally, we find that employment in the economy has evolved from manufacturing into two distinct types of services (1998–2015): SC Traded Services (with the highest STEM intensity and wages) versus B2C Main Street (with the lowest STEM intensity and wages). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Business-to-consumer industries; Economic growth; Innovation; Services; Supply chain industries","Commerce; Manufacture; Patents and inventions; Sales; Supply chains; Wages; Alternative framework; Business-to-consumer; Innovation in service; Innovative activities; Input-output; New industry; Service provider; U.s. economies; Service industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086821766

An intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainable and smart country-wide waste management system using industry 4.0 technologies. The system should provide a multi-dimensional approach, determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste management problems. A comprehensive systematic literature review, intensive focus group discussions, and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develop waste management business processes and their system design. Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

This paper begins by framing drones in healthcare as a social experiment where ethical guidelines are needed to protect those impacted while fully realizing the benefits the technology offers. Then we propose an ethical framework to facilitate the design, development, implementation, and assessment of drones used in public healthcare. Given the healthcare context, we structure the framework according to the four bioethics principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, plus a fifth principle from artificial intelligence ethics: explicability. These principles are abstract which makes operationalization a challenge; therefore, we suggest an approach of translation according to a values hierarchy whereby the top-level ethical principles are translated into relevant human values within the domain. The resulting framework is an applied ethics tool that facilitates awareness of relevant ethical issues during the design, development, implementation, and assessment of drones in public healthcare. © 2020, The Author(s).","Applied ethics; Drones; Public healthcare; Robot ethics; Value-sensitive design (VSD); Values hierarchy","artificial intelligence; beneficence; health care delivery; human; personal autonomy; social justice; Artificial Intelligence; Beneficence; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Personal Autonomy; Social Justice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086792326

This often creates local disconnectedness that energizes the current populist backlash against MNE activities. We develop approaches to new IB theory, addressing the interdependencies of MNEs and city-regions that we propose as a crucial avenue for future research. We contrast two generic MNE strategies. The first is the traditional one: the ‘global orchestration’ of resources and markets. We argue that it exacerbates local disconnectedness. The second, that we call ‘local spawning,’ involves engaging with the local entrepreneurial eco-system to create and renew local connectedness, diffusing populist responses. Some MNEs are better able to implement a local spawning strategy, due to industry factors like innovation clock-speed, and firm characteristics like organizational path dependency. Finally, we distinguish between disconnection, which is an outcome of MNE strategy, and global disruptions, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which are primarily stochastic events. Addressing disconnections requires MNEs to re-orient their strategies while dealing with disruptions requires undertaking risk mitigation.

However, the degree to which different water table level affects soil CO2 and CH4 emissions remains uncertain in coastal wetland. Here, a soil microcosm experiment with five water table levels (−40, −30, −20, −10, 0 cm) was conducted in the Yellow River Delta, China. The water table level was controlled by manual. The soil CO2 and CH4 emissions of each water table levels were measured during 150-days incubation in 2018. Our results showed that water table level rise decreased soil CO2 emissions, while increased soil CH4 emissions. However, there was no significant difference in soil CO2 and CH4 emissions from −20 to −40 water table levels, respectively. In addition, water table level rise significant alter soil physical and chemical properties in the uppermost soil layer (0–10 cm) in coastal wetland, in particular soil moisture and salinity, which probably jointly affected soil CO2 and CH4 emissions. Furthermore, cumulative soil CH4 emission was positively significantly correlated to soil organic carbon and total carbon, suggesting that carbon component can supply energy and nutrients and benefit for soil CH4 production. Additionally, there was a significant relationship between cumulative soil CO2 emission and dissolved organic carbon, which indicated that CO2 was mainly contributed from dissolved organic carbon. Cumulative soil CO2 emission was significantly correlated with soil microbial biomass carbon, suggesting that microbial activity played an important role in CO2 emissions in coastal wetlands. Our results also indicate that water table level rise caused by sea level rise may contribute to the storage of soil organic carbon and produces a lower global warming potentials of CH4 and CO2 in the further climate change.

Our study contributes to filling this gap by investigating how technological and organizational changes affect the mix of jobs within the firm. To this end we merge two firm level surveys from Denmark and add registry data to gain detailed knowledge of changes in the firms’ occupational structure. We construct measures of work organization in line with previous research and using a translog model we show that changes in work organization are associated with polarization by substituting and complementing different skill groups, even in the absence of technological change and changes in offshoring. The results show not only that the organizational level is central to understanding possible trends towards job polarization, but also demonstrate that changes in work organization often co-occur with changes in technology and in offshoring behavior, leading to interactions effects between organizational change, and technology and offshoring on job polarization. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Delegation; Integration, Involvement; Job polarization; Technological change; Work organization","Machinery; Empirical literature; Off-shoring; Organizational change; Organizational levels; Technical change; Technological change; Translog model; Work organization; Polarization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086426823

By using a humanitarian cargo drone study as a starting point, this paper tackles the challenges that VSD’s lack of commitment to a specific ethical theory generates in practical applications. Besides, it highlights how mainstream ethical approaches usually related to VSD are incapable of solving main ethical dilemmas raised by technological design for well-being in democratic settings. Accordingly, it is argued that VSD’s ethical-democratic import would substantially be enhanced by the espousal of a procedural ethics stance and the deliberative approach to value and welfare entailed by Amartya Sen’s capability approach. Differently from rival ethical–political theories, its normative and meta-ethical foundations better handle human diversity, value-goal pluralism, conflicting vested interests as well as the epistemic-moral disagreements typical of contemporary complex democracies. Particularly, Sen’s capability approach procedural-deliberative tenets result in an “objective-impartial” choice procedure selecting a “hierarchy” of plural incommensurable values and rational goals thus, suitable to validate an applied science such as welfare-oriented technological design in concrete social environments. Conclusions suggest that refining VSD with a capability-based procedural approach to ethics fosters the concern for democracy and social justice while preserving vital scientific-technical standards. Major advantages are at an applied level to delivering ethically and socially justified, but yet highly functional technologies and high-tech products/artefacts. © 2020, The Author(s).","Amartya sen’s capability approach; Democracy; Participatory-deliberative methods; Procedural ethics; Technological design for well-being; Value sensitive design (VSD)","cultural diversity; ethical theory; human; morality; social justice; technology; Cultural Diversity; Ethical Theory; Humans; Morals; Social Justice; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085564814

Successful change requires the reconciliation and integration of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top management must set the direction and should then step back and allow the diagnosis and solution-development processes to take place in a bottom-up manner. This allows employees to identify and solve the problems that matter to them and that reflect their organizational reality. The implementation of the changes toward the end of the change process should take place in a top-down manner. The model of cascadingchange is based on three key drivers: a cascading change process with formal handovers engaging more and more employees, Lewinian change processes of unfreeze, move, and refreeze, and, finally, orchestrated employee participation. The cascading change process is found to build participation, transparency, trust, and commitment to the change among employees and managers. In turn, this ensures that implementation occurs without problems. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.MAD statement: Organizational change often fails at delivering the envisioned results. This paper proposes a ‘model of cascading change’ that combines planned and emergent change management approaches to orchestrate change. In this model top management defines the scope of the change process but leaves the analysis, diagnosis, and solution development to the employees through a series of workshops. A structured handover between workshops ensures that knowledge and solutions are transferred transparently. During a final culminating workshop, all solutions are qualified across professional groups and presented to the top management, who subsequently implement them. The model generates employee engagement and ease of implementation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Change leadership; Employee participation; Planned and emergent change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084996354

Previous studies suggest that media presence, by way of shaping public and policy perceptions, influence how well nonprofits are able to raise funds and mobilize human resources. Yet, we are lacking insights into how the third sector is actually framed in the media, in particular with regard to innovation, which increasingly complements the more traditional functions of advocacy and service provision. To find out, we performed a longitudinal content analysis and an in-depth framing analysis on national and regional newspapers from nine European countries. The analyses demonstrate that third sector activities, especially those related to social innovation, are largely ignored. We find no systematic evidence that crises increase news attention to nonprofit activities. The third sector is becoming more newsworthy when it co-engages with government and business actors, but can benefit only little from this “positive glow”. We suggest how research on these matters can be taken forward, with a specific focus on the agenda-setting theory of mass media, the strategic management of nonprofit organizations, and collaboration in the context of social innovation. © 2020, The Author(s).","Framing; Media; Nonprofit; Social innovation; Third sector","human resource; innovation; mass media; nonprofit organization; participatory approach; perception; third sector; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084237176

Consequently, this paper seeks to illustrate how social actors make use of different modalities to accomplish leadership, which we conceptualize as the creation of direction, alignment, and commitment. Through multimodal conversation analysis this paper explores interactions between actors in virtual contexts, a particularly interesting empirical setting as the context offers specific constraints on everyday workplace interaction. By zooming in on the interaction using transcripts of naturally occurring interaction, we find that the accomplishment of leadership, direction, alignment, and commitment, in a constrained virtual context can appear mundane. However, at the same time the accomplishment of leadership calls for the mobilization of several multimodal resources (both talk and information and communication technology objects). The analysis makes it evident that the actors mobilize objects to draw on their situated affordances, in the accomplishment of direction, alignment, and commitment. With a fine-grained analysis of naturally occurring data, we illustrate that leadership is a collective achievement. We also expand the understanding of leadership in practice, especially in virtual contexts, by demonstrating how actors utilize objects and verbal resources in the co-production of leadership. © The Author(s) 2020.","information and communication technology; Leadership-in-interaction; meetings; multimodal conversation analysis; objects; virtual context",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084084544

The chance occurrence of the attack five days into the survey demarcates respondents into two groups surveyed before and after the attack and allows us to examine how the attack affected approval of politicians and trust in political institutions. Our results show that people mainly attribute responsibility to the president and not to parliament or local government, while trust in institutions is largely unaffected. We also show that these effects are strongest in the region of the attack.

In particular, we assess whether one of the central contentions of agency theory, that incentive contracting and delegation are jointly determined, holds in different cultural regions. Drawing on prior literature, we hypothesise that the MC practices that operate as a complement to delegation vary depending on societal values and preferences, and that MC practices other than incentive contracting will complement delegation in firms in non-Anglo cultural regions. Using data collected from 584 strategic business units across three Western cultural regions (Anglo, Germanic, Nordic), our results show that the interdependence between delegation and incentive contracting is confined to Anglo firms. In the Nordic and Germanic regions, we find that strategic and action planning participation operate as a complement to delegation, while delegation is also complemented by manager selection in Nordic firms. Overall, our study demonstrates that cultural values and preferences significantly influence MC interdependence, and suggests that caution needs to be taken in making cross-cultural generalisations about the complementarity of MC practices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Complementarity; Culture; Delegation; Incentives; Interdependence; Management control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081960030

The mobility of labor between these MNCs and the rest of the economy is therefore an important mechanism for the diffusion of knowledge and technology, but these flows are not without friction. This paper analyses in great detail the flow of labor between firms with specific emphasis on flows to and from R&D intensive MNCs. Using linked employer-employee data for Denmark, we match employees moving from R&D intensive MNCs to other employees switching jobs. We find that employees are more inclined to move between R&D intensive MNCs and their subsidiaries rather than between these firms and other firms in the economy. This is particularly true for high skill employees. Our results suggest that other domestic firms are to a larger extent kept out of the ‘knowledge spillover’ loop, which provides them with fewer opportunities to learn from the R&D intensive MNCs. In other words, R&D intensive MNCs and their subsidiaries form a kind of sub-labor market within the national labor market; employees exhibit higher mobility within this group of firms than between this group and the rest of the labor market. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Knowledge flows; Labor mobility; Multinational companies; R&D","Commerce; Employment; Technology transfer; Diffusion of knowledge; Knowledge and technology transfer; Knowledge flow; Knowledge spillovers; Labor mobilities; Linked employer-employee datum; Multi-national companies; Private sectors; Personnel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078937276

Some well-known recent applications include self-driving cars and computers playing games with super-human performance. One of the main advantages of this approach is that there is no need to explicitly model the nature of the interactions with the environment. In this work, we present a new airline Revenue Management System (RMS) based on RL, which does not require a demand forecaster. The optimization module remains but works in a different way. It is theoretically proven that RL converges to the optimal solution; however, in practice, the system may require a significant amount of data (a booking history with millions of daily departures) to learn the optimal policies.

In the years, emerging economies have shown great growth potential and have attracted significant foreign direct investment, especially from companies willing to set up operations. Despite such a seemingly favourable trade environment, not all companies that entered an emerging economy have been successful. Thus, there is a need to understand the factors that influence the success of any offshore location decision. It is also important to understand the relative importance of these factors, in order to develop novel insights useful to practitioners. There is a lack of literature addressing this issue, which this study aims to fill. We conducted a multi-case analysis with examples of European companies entering India. The findings indicate that successful companies employed locally focused business strategies that enabled them to acquire important relationships and knowledge, and also to adapt to formal institutions, including governmental and regulatory procedures. It was found that, irrespective of size, disregarding collaborative strategies was the main reason for exiting India. These findings are highly relevant for managers and policy makers. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emerging economies; institutional theory; location decision; offshoring","Economics; Failure (mechanical); Location; Offshore oil well production; Collaborative strategies; Emerging economies; Foreign direct investments; Institutional factors; Institutional theory; Location decisions; Off-shoring; Offshore locations; Decision theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073825697

However, the current studies on CMfg and SCOS have generally focused on optimising the allocation of resources against quality of service (QoS), in terms of e.g. cost, quality, and time. They have seldom taken the perspective of sustainability into discussion, although sustainability is indispensable in the CMfg environment. Addressing this gap, we aim to (1) propose a comprehensive method to assess the sustainability of cloud manufacturing (SoM) in terms of the economic, environmental, and social aspects; (2) establish a multi-objective integer bi-level multi-follower programming (MOIBMFP) model to simultaneously maximise SoM and QoS from the perspectives of both platform operator and multiple service demanders; and (3) design a hybrid particle swarm optimisation algorithm to solve the proposed MOIBMFP model. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more feasible and effective than the typical multi-objective particle swarm optimisation algorithm when solving the proposed model. In other words, the proposed model and algorithm suggest better alternatives to meet the needs of the platform operator and service demanders in the CMfg environment. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cloud manufacturing; cloud service composition; multi-objective integer bi-level multi-follower programming; particle swarm optimisation; quality of service; sustainability of cloud manufacturing","Computer aided manufacturing; Integer programming; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Social aspects; Sustainable development; Telecommunication services; Cloud Manufacturing; Cloud manufacturing (CMfg); Cloud service compositions; Comprehensive method; Multi-follower programming; Particle swarm optimisation; Particle swarm optimisation algorithms; Sustainability considerations; Quality of service",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073811439

This is achieved by modeling the payment of ships in a number of periodical installments rather than in a lump sum paid upfront, representing more closely the actual cash flows for a shipping company. Based on this, we propose two alternative risk control measures, where the first imposes that the cash flow in each time period is always higher than a desired threshold, while the second limits the Conditional Value-at-Risk. We test the two models on realistic test instances based on data from a shipping company. The computational study demonstrates how the two models can be used to assess the trade-offs between risk of insolvency and expected profits in the MFRP. © 2019 The Authors","Conditional value-at-risk; Maritime fleet renewal; Maritime transportation; Risk control; Stochastic programming","article; investment; profit; risk assessment; ship; shipping; stochastic model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068829846

Yet, they exist in apparent tension. The collaborative economy is grounded in communities. These are typically characterized by isonomic relations, in which the singularity of members finds its distinctiveness in being woven into mutual, collective endeavor. Yet, the collaborative economy also entails digital platforms organized through largely heteronomic relations in which employees and users are configured as isolate, useful, interchangeable, and flexible “units.” As such, communities and platforms are traditionally framed as separate from, and in contradiction to, one another. There is, it seems a paradox at the heart of the collaborative economy. Yet, inspired by the work of Merleau-Ponty, we argue the expression, embodiment, and eventfulness characterizing the collaborative economy show communities and platforms being constituted by one another. We conclude that the paradox, far from being a condition of opposition and dialectical tension requiring managed resolution, is a generative organizational process. © The Author(s) 2019.","chiasm; collaborative economy; community; digital; organization; paradox; phenomenology; platform; platform capitalism; technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062502645

The results have provided only limited support for the constructs that represent orientations towards the various stakeholder groups. This has led to an evolution in the conceptualization of the stakeholders that are included in the PMO model across existing literature with the aim of addressing this problem; whilst the inclusion of voters, party members and competing parties have received a degree of support across empirical investigations, it has proved difficult to usefully conceptualize other stakeholder groups. The research aim of this paper is to integrate recent advances in the theoretical foundations of political marketing with conceptual model of PMO in order to propose a revised conceptualization of a political stakeholder orientation. This aim is motivated by a need to further develop the conceptual foundations of the political marketing research field. This paper discusses recent research into the nature of stakeholders in the political marketing context and of the nature of the political exchange of value as a series of three, linked interactions. We subsequently present and critique the stakeholder orientation constructs of the PMO model. Finally, we demonstrate how these recent advances in the political marketing literature necessitate the development of the PMO concept into a broader PSO concept, based on a stakeholder perspective on political marketing. © 2017, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Market orientation; political market orientation; political marketing; political stakeholder orientation; stakeholder orientation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024401675

A new randomized field trial replicates elements of previous studies and extends them by using an additional age-appropriate outcome measure. Methodologically, the results illustrate the challenges of carrying out replication studies because when target groups change, outcome measures also often change. Substantially, the findings suggest that a government initiative providing parents with materials and information to enhance parents’ coproduction efforts can be extended to a broader target group of parents.

It explores how environmental performance above or below aspirations affects the implementation of GSCM practices (specifically sustainable production [SP] and sustainable sourcing [SS]) through the lens of the behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF), which has received scant attention in the operations management literature. Design/methodology/approach: The study used data from the sixth round of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS). It employed hierarchical linear regression to test the proposed hypotheses. Moreover, the study tested an alternate model to rule out the possible role of financial performance aspirations in explaining the implementation of SP and SS. Findings: The results indicate that organizations determine their efforts put into the two GSCM practices according to environmental performance feedback: the greater the aspiration–environmental performance discrepancy, the stronger the efforts put into implementing GSCM practices. Originality/value: This study contributes to the GSCM literature by revealing the impact of environmental performance aspirations on the implementation of GSCM practices through the lens of the BTOF. It also extends the BTOF by applying it in the GSCM context and indicating that performance feedback is based on environmental performance instead of financial performance in this specific context. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aspirations; Environmental performance feedback; Green supply chain management; Sustainable production; Sustainable sourcing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090150939

In this study, to investigate the extent to which potential differences in the outcomes of these two methods influence the benchmarking strategies, a comparative analysis based on a common set of data gathered from 19 logistics service providers is implemented. Design/methodology/approach: As suppliers' sustainability cannot be improved in a single-step process due to several limitations, improvement needs to proceed gradually. Therefore, using the self-organising map method, the suppliers were classified into clusters within a novel framework for gradually improving their sustainability. Then, the two processes of gradual improvement based on the outcomes of DEA and AHP were compared. Findings: The findings show that although the rankings of suppliers guided by the methods correlated to a high degree, the benchmarking strategies provided by the methods for gradually improving the sustainability of suppliers differed considerably. In particular, whereas AHP suggests a benchmarking policy better suited for unsustainable or less sustainable suppliers with limited access to resources, DEA proposes one for suppliers able to dramatically boost their sustainability with few quick, significant leaps in performance. Originality/value: First, this study revealed a novel gradual improvement framework using the self-organising map method. Second, it clarified the extent to which the benchmarking policies are influenced by the type of evaluation method. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytical hierarchy process; Benchmarking; Data envelopment analysis; Gradual improvement; Self-organising map; Sustainable supplier selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087555597

Therefore, assessing the role of ecological restoration policies in desertification is extremely urgent, especially quantified policies contribution. Here, we quantify the desertification process in the Mu Us Desert (China) from 1986 to 2015 based on remote sensing images, and using panel data analysis to assess the relative roles of climate, socioeconomic development and ecological restoration as drivers of these dynamics based on meteorological record, socioeconomic statistics and input funds of ecological restoration projects. We found (1) that, between 1986 and 2015, desertification of the Mu Us Desert initially intensified, but then declined, with maximum desertification in 2005, and (2) that, ecological restoration policies represent the dominant factor underlying the mitigation of desertification (60.9%), with a smaller, negative role of socioeconomic development (37.2%) and low impact of climate (1.8%). (3) There was obvious spatial heterogeneity in desertification process, with varying patterns among the three provinces (Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Ningxia): Desertification in Inner Mongolia experienced two episodes of intensification and reversals, with the strongest desertification in 1990 and 2005, while it peaked in Shaanxi and Ningxia in 2000 and 2005, respectively, with recovery in the following years. (4) Considerable differences are observed in the three driving factors affecting the desertification dynamics at the provincial scale, with socioeconomic factors (36.4%) accounting for a slightly higher contribution than ecological restoration policies (34.8%) and climate factors (28.9%) in Inner Mongolia. The reversal of desertification has mainly driven by ecological restoration policies in Shaanxi (55.8%) and climatic factors in Ningxia (44.1%). This study reveals the desertification process, and detects the key role of ecological restoration policies in recovering from desertification by using quantitative policy data in the Mu Us Desert. Based on this, we suggest continuing to implement ecological restoration policy to maintain desertification recovery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; Driving factor; Ecological restoration project; Policy; Socioeconomic","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Landforms; Recovery; Remote sensing; Restoration; Climatic factors; Ecological restoration; Meteorological records; Panel data analysis; Remote sensing images; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic factor; Spatial heterogeneity; Climatology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087340442

Relying on social systems engineering principles, we propose a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework considering four port governance models and five major GPM practice indicators. We validate the MCDM framework using survey data collected from top management executives of three ports in the Indian Ocean Rim — Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. We compare the Analytic Network Process (ANP) method with more recently developed Best-Worst Method (BWM) in analysis of the MCDM problem of finding the right port governance model for GPM. We collect data using the ANP and BWM survey in January 2019 and August 2019, respectively, from the same respondents. While participating in the study in January 2019, the respondents did not know that they would respond to the same MCDM problem using a different model, which corresponds to a repeated measures experimental design.

The goal of the study was to determine whether or not refinery wastewater reclamation for different industrial purposes, namely boiler feedwater, cooling water and fire water, leads to an overall benefit across different environmental aspects, besides alleviating freshwater resources, when compared to current wastewater disposal practices. The basis for the assessment was the hypothetical scale-up of a demonstration plant tested with real wastewaters from November 2018 to May 2019 at the Izmit petroleum refinery operated by Tüpraş. This demonstration plant consisted of different treatment modules, including dissolved air flotation, ceramic membrane bioreactor, catalytic wet-air oxidation, advanced oxidation with ozone and hydrogen peroxide, and reverse osmosis. The LCA was conducted following consequential modelling principles, and six environmental indicators were analysed in detail at midpoint level: global warming, respiratory inorganics, marine ecotoxicity, aquatic eutrophication, freshwater consumption and non-renewable energy demand. All three reclamation scenarios (boiler, cooling, fire water) succeeded in achieving a life-cycle freshwater saving, of around 1 m3 freshwater saved per m3 refinery wastewater. Beneficial results were also obtained in marine ecotoxicity and aquatic eutrophication, where impact is reduced up to 90% and 84%, respectively. With regard to global warming and non-renewable energy demand, only the boiler feedwater application appeared to involve an improvement over wastewater disposal, showing a net reduction of 2.2 kg CO2-eq and 40 MJ per m3 wastewater, respectively, thanks to potential thermal energy savings. For cooling makeup water and fire water, impacts were between 2 and 2.5 times higher in these two indicators when compared to wastewater disposal. Finally, the indicator on respiratory inorganic effects, showed higher impact, by a factor 2 to 7, for all reuse scenarios, due to electricity demand, which is linked to the Turkish electricity production mix with a substantial contribution from coal power plants. Thus, the results reflect that achieving a product water of very high quality comes at the price of a high energy demand. Nevertheless, A sensitivity analysis shows that the environmental performance of all scenarios would improve to a great extent when shifting to an electricity mix with a higher share of renewables, as is the current trend in most European countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced oxidation process; Catalytic wet air oxidation; Ceramic membrane bioreactor; Dissolved air flotation; Reverse osmosis; Wastewater reclamation","Artificial life; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Boilers; Catalytic oxidation; Ceramic membranes; Coal industry; Cooling; Cooling water; Energy conservation; Energy management; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Flotation; Gasoline; Global warming; Life cycle; Petroleum refineries; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater disposal; Water; Catalytic wet air oxidation; Dissolved air flotations; Electricity production; Environmental indicators; Environmental performance; Fresh water consumption; Fresh water resources; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Wastewater reclamation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085472222

The sociologically inclined landscape of finance studies is characterized by different more or less well- established homogeneous camps, with more micro-empirical, social studies of finance approaches on the one end of the spectrum and more theoretical, often neo-Marxist approaches, on the other. Yet alternative approaches are also gaining traction, including work that emphasizes the cultural homologies and interconnections with finance as well as work that, more broadly, is both empirically rigorous and theoretically ambitious. Importantly, across these various approaches to finance, a growing body of literature is taking shape which engages finance in a critical manner. The term ""critical finance studies"" nonetheless remains largely unfocused and undefined. Against this backdrop, the key rationales of The Routledge Handbook of Critical Finance Studies are firstly to provide a coherent notion of this emergent field and secondly to demonstrate its analytical usefulness across a wide range of central aspects of contemporary finance. As such, the volume will offer a comprehensive guide to students and academics on the field of Finance and Critical Finance Studies, Heterodox Economics, Accounting, and related Management disciplines. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

In this conceptual article, we pursue the question of how we can make this happen, and argue why it is up to every individual to do so. Based on the rationale of the four-c model of creativity, we argue for four levels of individual sustainability actions: mini-s, little-s, Pro-S and Big-S. Mini-s actions are intrapersonal and represent a core element of individual learning about sustainability. Little-s actions are more interpersonal and demonstrate, on average, a higher reach and impact than mini-s. Pro-S stands for professional actions and solutions. These types of actions are interpersonal and extend their reach and impact beyond a small group of people. They usually need some degree of expertise to achieve a greater reach and impact. Big-S relates to big actions with the highest reach, impact, novelty and usefulness. They refer to solutions that are likely to change how we generally relate to a given product or category and cause a drastic change in our lifestyle. We discuss each action category with examples and outline how these actions may support different sustainability solutions. For this, we search relevant literature on current measurement and conceptual approaches and on specific solutions and take the case of a comprehensive economic approach, steady state economy. Also, concrete levels, conditions, goals, attributes, creativity degrees, profits, motivations and bottom-up principles with examples of application are introduced. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual paper; Creativity; Individual sustainability; Innovation; Sustainability; Sustainability action; Sustainability measurement","Economics; Sustainable development; Bottom up; C modeling; Conceptual approaches; Core elements; Economic approach; Individual learning; S models; Steady state; Solution mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085031077

Bio-residuals are organic wastes, side streams, or residues that remain at the end of the processing of a biological raw material. These under-utilized resources have the potential to support circular bioeconomies, given they can be valorized through viable value chains. To better understand this potential and gain insights in the opportunities for these resources, we analyzed 57 publications that contained findings related to value chains for bio-residuals valorization. The value chains were partitioned into the categories of resource procurement, transport and handling, transformation and processing, valorization and market, and end use. Additionally, the contextual drivers were analyzed, including policy and governance, business strategies, economics, demand, innovation, research, and development, and actors and networks. After summarizing the state of the art in research for bio-residuals valorization, the value chains were categorized for each sector. The push-pull factors were then identified, and how these influence bio-residual value chains. These analyses reveal that the dairy industry has a well-developed value chain for bio-residuals, with a myriad products from whey being pulled by market demand. With the knowledge and capabilities of the dairies, this creates a modular value chain for these products. The slaughterhouse industry resembles the dairy industry, but has greater barriers for valorization of animal by-products and so less market pull, leading to more conglomeration of rendering operations. Valorization of slaughterhouse residuals indicates a captive value chain. Contrarily, valorization of brewers spent grains (BSG) has been slow to develop, due mainly to low supplier capability, and the BSG value chain is dominated by the use of unprocessed BSG as animal feed. The forestry industry has been slow to invest in technological and market capabilities for valorizing residuals, due to weak market pull, high capital needs, and risk-adverse strategies among the few incumbent firms. As a result, the value chain for forest residues is still mainly hierarchical and rather undeveloped; yet with the recent entry of many new firms competing for biomass for a variety of end products, a shift towards a relational value chain serving a greener and more complex industrial symbiosis production model could be developing. Synthesizing across the sectors, we conclude that the materiality of the residuals, regulations, transformation technology, firm capabilities, actors, and the market are all important factors shaping the value chains for bio-residual products, with each sector having unique challenges and opportunities related to their value chains. As such, more research is needed not only in transformation and processing of residuals, but also regarding more downstream parts of the value chain, such as end-product markets, as well as cross-cutting issues such as governance and regulation. This would better promote valorization pathways, creating a market pull rather than just a technology push for bio-residuals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-residuals; Circular bioeconomy; Food processing waste; Forest materials; Global value chain; Valorization","Animals; Bioeconomy; Commerce; Cutting; Dairy products; Forestry; Planning; Timber; Animal by-products; Brewers spent grains; End product markets; Industrial symbiosis; Literature reviews; Production modeling; Transformation technologies; Utilized resources; Investments",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084849727

We propose a framework that includes the contributions of co-creating actors and identification with the firm as antecedents of customer satisfaction and loyalty. This framework can be adapted to a context by defining a context-specific set of actors and their unique reciprocal relationships. Two quantitative studies conducted in the professional German soccer leagues demonstrate that multiple actors (event organizer, teams, and fans) roughly show the same effect on customer satisfaction. Moreover, identification has both direct and indirect (i.e. via customer satisfaction and perceived social actors’ contributions) influence on customer loyalty. The results imply firm activities have limited influence on customer satisfaction and loyalty.

They then empirically demonstrate that members’ loyalty to the center is fueled by the resources they receive from others in the center and that their experience in the center mediates the relationship between exchanged resources and member loyalty. This research reveals that service organizations may foster person-place bonds by providing customers with resources over and above goods and services. Customers appreciate resources that transform their well-being, such as social support and natural, restorative resources, and they demonstrate loyalty to places where they can obtain therapeutic resources.

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory case study is conducted with a longitudinal focus, aiming to understand both proactive and reactive SCRM practices using a holistic perspective of a real-life example. Findings: The study demonstrates how Ericsson's SCRM practices have developed, indicating that improved functional capabilities are increasingly combined across silos and leveraged by formalized learning processes. Important enablers are IT capabilities, a fine-grained and cross-functional organization, and a focus on monitoring and compliance. Major developments in SCRM are often triggered by incidents, but also by requirements from external stakeholders and new corporate leaders actively focusing on SCRM and related activities. Research limitations/implications: Relevant areas for future research are proposed, thereby increasing the knowledge of how companies can develop SCRM practices and capabilities further. Practical implications: Being one of few in-depth holistic case studies of SCRM, decision-makers can learn about many practices and tools. Of special interest is the detailed description of how Ericsson reactively responded to the Fukushima incident (2011), and how it proactively engaged in monitoring and assessment activities. It is also exemplified how SCRM practices could continuously be developed to make them “stick” to the organization, even in stable times. Originality/value: This is one of the first case studies to delve deeper into the development of SCRM practices through taking a longitudinal approach. © 2020, Andreas Norrman and Andreas Wieland.","Capabilities; Ericsson; Longitudinal; Proactive; Reactive; Resilience; Risk monitoring; Supply chain risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086934955

The subject of analysis is a set of five buildings erected within the same constrictions in terms of floor area, energy performance and construction costs. The tested design strategies were: use of recycled materials, design for extended durability of components, adaptable design, and design for reduction of operational energy demand. The results of the five buildings are compared with a reference building (i.e. a typical, Danish single-family dwelling). Results show that the recycling/upcycling strategy is the most effective in reducing the embodied carbon. The use of structural wood in the same design furthermore points to the use of wood as a viable low-carbon strategy. In combination, these two strategies result in an approximate 40% saving of life cycle embodied carbon compared to the reference. Using durable materials yields up to 30% lower embodied carbon compared to the reference, whereas a design for adaptability results in 17% lower embodied carbon. However, these results are sensitive to the scenarios made for the service lives of materials and the implemented disassembly solutions. In a life cycle carbon perspective, the emissions from energy use prove to be of importance, although depending on the modelling approaches of the energy mix. With the shrinking, global carbon budgets in mind, there is justified reason to holistically optimize the design of new buildings by integrating various design aspects addressing the whole life cycle of the building. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","building design; carbon budgets; Embodied carbon; life cycle assessment; mitigation strategies","Artificial life; Budget control; Carbon; Durability; Ecodesign; Energy utilization; Housing; Life cycle; Recycling; Building design; Carbon budgets; Embodied carbons; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mitigation strategy; Architectural design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082720660

Importantly, I find that the introduction of a tax leads to a non-linear pricing function.

When beta comoves with market variance and the stochastic discount factor (SDF), beta risk is priced, and the expected return on a stock deviates from the security market line. The model predicts that low-beta stocks earn high returns, because their beta positively comoves with market variance and the SDF. The opposite is true for high-beta stocks. Estimating the model on equity and option data, we find that beta risk explains expected returns on low- and high-beta stocks, resolving the “betting against beta” anomaly. © The Author(s) 2019.

How one evaluates managerial decision making will partly depend on what conception of the corporate function one endorses. Agency Theory and its accompanying shareholder conception of the corporate function has long dominated management. Voices in management learning have called for a change, but we argue that such change has been hampered by the lack of a theory of managerial deliberation, which is compatible with the alternative stakeholder conception of the corporate function. Here, we develop a novel theory of managerial deliberation: one that is suited to stakeholder theory. We argue that if genuine ethical deliberation is to become prevalent within management, then we must conceive of managerial deliberation as a creative, yet rational, learning process, while we assure that this process is adequately constrained to allow for managerial accountability. By taking inspiration from modern philosophical theories of deliberation, we provide such a theory of rational managerial deliberation.

Because different studies rely on differing conceptualizations, the current body of knowledge is scattered and lacks a uniform language and conceptual boundaries. Specifically, existing research has subsumed inherently different products under one collective term, has relied on a multitude of ad hoc criteria to define smart products or has conflated smart products with the services they render and/or the wider ecosystem, in which they operate. These developments limit the systematic advancement of the field and impede the integration of the smart product concept into related concepts such as the Internet of Things. To address these issues, this article provides an extensive analysis of the status quo of the field, with the goal of developing a common language and comprehensive conceptualization of smart products. First, existing studies on smart products were systematically reviewed across contributing disciplines and supplemented with a bibliometric analysis that allowed for a deeper understanding of the smart product concept within and across disciplines. This analysis revealed an initial set of 16 capability-based criteria that are currently applied to conceptualize smart products. Second, based on a systematic coding procedure, these criteria were synthesized and organized within a comprehensive framework delineating four distinct product archetypes for the digital age: (1) Digital, (2) Connected, (3) Responsive, and (4) Intelligent. Third, three major conceptual themes that arise from this framework are identified and possibilities for future research are pointed out. In sum, this work contributes to the literature by improving the understanding of smart products as an epistemic object and by laying the ground for more cumulative research endeavors. © 2020 The Authors.

Using a multi-method approach involving event structure analysis and an inductive multiple case study, we find that four key organizational practices—asset multiplication, leveraging human capital, building social embeddedness, and affordable quality—embody the jugaad elements of frugality and inclusivity. Adding to the social entrepreneurship literature, this study demonstrates that the jugaad approach is conceptually distinct from bricolage and relevant to the study of social enterprises' resource mobilization processes. Managerial Summary: How do social enterprises encounter and manage dilemmas over time in emerging markets? The present study responds to this question, finding that social entrepreneurs mobilize resources and overcome dilemmas using the practices of jugaad, the “Indian method” of problem-solving. These jugaad practices can be used to build and allocate resources and create trade-offs among the jugaad elements of frugality and inclusivity. Based on our results, we recommend that social entrepreneurs pay close attention to how to proceduralize human assets, which would allow these entrepreneurs to build training systems that are highly task-focused and replicated across functions. We also encourage social entrepreneurs to work in rural markets and seek wider resource pools within these markets by building social embeddedness in rural communities. © 2020 The Authors.

I then build two 2 × 2 bundling models, one in which the SME provides content and the MNE distributes it, and another with the reverse configuration. In these 2 × 2s the axes are the transactional properties of the two complementary inputs, content and distribution, that MNEs and SMEs bundle to create value.

Four different types of teams are created which differ in terms of their cognitive skill composition.

One effective method to reduce these losses is to construct a disaster relief network to deliver disaster supplies as quickly as possible. This method requires solutions to the following problems. 1) Given the established distribution centers, which center(s) should be open after a disaster? 2) Given a set of vehicles, how should these vehicles be assigned to each open distribution center? 3) How can the vehicles be routed from the open distribution center(s) to demand points as efficiently as possible? 4) How many supplies can be delivered to each demand point on the condition that the relief allocation plan is made a priority before the actual demands are realized? This study proposes a model for risk-averse optimization of disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing under stochastic demand that solves the four problems simultaneously. The novel contribution of this study is its presentation of a new model that includes conditional value at risk with regret (CVaR-R)—defined as the expected regret of worst-case scenarios—as a risk measure that considers both the reliability and unreliability aspects of demand variability in the disaster relief facility location and vehicle routing problem. Two objectives are proposed: the CVaR-R of the waiting time and the CVaR-R of the system cost. Due to the nonlinear capacity constraints for vehicles and distribution centers, the proposed problem is formulated as a bi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model and is solved with a hybrid genetic algorithm that integrates a genetic algorithm to determine the satisfactory solution for each demand scenario and a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to obtain the non-dominated Pareto solution that considers all demand scenarios. Moreover, the Nash bargaining solution is introduced to capture the decision-maker's interests of the two objectives. Numerical examples demonstrate the trade-off between the waiting time and system cost and the effects of various parameters, including the confidence level and distance parameter, on the solution. It is found that the Pareto solutions are distributed unevenly on the Pareto frontier due to the difference in the number of the distribution centers opened. The Pareto frontier and Nash bargaining solution change along with the confidence level and distance parameter, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-objective optimization; Conditional value at risk with regret; Disaster relief location-routing problem; Hybrid genetic algorithm; Nash bargaining solution","demand analysis; disaster management; disaster relief; facility location; genetic algorithm; optimization; risk assessment; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087942637

Statistical analysis was used to compare craftsmen efficiency and CLP data from North America (NA) in the period 1972-2010. Craftsmen efficiency data were extracted from published work that measured direct work (DW) through work sampling, and CLP data were extracted from national databases. A statistically significant relationship between DW and CLP was established. This revealed that adding 36 s of DW to every work hour could yield a yearly return of 5.4 billion USD to the NA gross domestic product (GDP). Results show that more focus on activity and project level efficiency is crucial for changing the trends of national CLP.

Less is known about the large number of products outside the core that still account for a considerable share of the export value. I use high-quality Swedish firm-registry data to investigate if the exports of core and non-core products are systematically interconnected. Using a novel instrumental variable approach, I find evidence that the exports of non-core products respond to trade of the core. Conversely, the same complementarity is not found using non-core products as placebo-cores. Decomposing the response, I find that over a quarter of the effect can be attributed to price changes of non-core products, suggestive of demand-side explanations. The main contribution of this paper is identifying a new, sizeable, and systematic within-firm one-way complementarity between products that can explain non-core product trade flows. Ignoring this pattern of cross-product dependence may lead to an under-emphasis on the core and over-emphasis on individual trade flows as products should not be viewed in isolation, since the ‘superstar’ core has (contemporaneous) followers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Intra-firm product dependence; Multi-product firms; Product complementarity; Product demand; Product synergies; Within-destination export variation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087363491

However, the narrative that single, childfree women must currently, by contrast, be unconcernedly enjoying a surge of productivity needs to be nuanced. Therefore, with this article, I autoethnographically discuss how living alone in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic provides its own set of circumstances and is hardly problem-free, which affects how one can deal with issues of academic productivity and work–life balance.

We exploit a sample of 230,854 articles (1985 - 2005), published on 8 journals of the American Physical Society (APS) and 2.4 million citations to test the indicators using (i) a Configuration Null Model, (ii) an external validation set of articles related to Nobel Prize winning researches and APS Milestones, (iii) a set of established interdisciplinarity indicators, and (iv) the relationship with the articles’ impact. We find that novelty as the first appearance of a knowledge combination captures the key structural properties of the citation network and finds it difficult to tell novel and non-novel articles apart, while novelty as an atypical combination of knowledge overlaps with interdisciplinarity.

However, little attention has been paid to its consequences. A limited literature indicates that Chinese seafarers may leave state-owned enterprises to become freelance seafarers, working in the global labour market for better wages and employment conditions. There have been predictions of a substantial increase in seafarer export, with China becoming the top labour supplier to the global maritime industry. However, such expectations have been largely unmet. Through 157 qualitative interviews with seafarers and managers in Chinese ship crewing agencies, we explore some reasons why this may be so. The findings suggest that Chinese seafarers are in fact limited in their willingness and ability to leave their companies. This is due to a complex mixture of organisational, regulatory, infrastructural and personal contexts that are their everyday experience of work in China. Analysis further suggests that the underdevelopment of a national regulatory infrastructure and welfare support mechanism for seafarers, along with poor implementation of the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, combine to limit the extent of the reform of the Chinese seafaring labour market. Together, these factors help to explain why China’s seafaring labour export has been far lower than anticipated.

The crucial step of scenario planning is the effective identification of the uncertain and most influential drivers and key factors. This paper integrates the Delphi survey into scenario planning. It proposes a four-step analytical procedure of Delphi survey-based scenario planning: identifying the key ingredients from Delphi results, establishing the causal relationships among key ingredients, scenario development, and scenario description. The integrated method has been adopted in the planning practice for the renewable energy development strategy towards 2030 in China. Based on the three uncertain and most influential drivers, “technology development,” “ecological awareness,” and “national energy pricing,” most possibly influencing the renewable energy development towards 2030 in China, a novel three-dimensional scenario analytical framework composed of eight future scenarios is constructed. Considering the possibility in China's practice, five scenarios are selected as possible development scenarios of China's renewable energy towards 2030.

The late globalization phenomena are multilevel and multidimensional; this paper offers an initial portal into these phenomena. Understanding late globalization would provide academic insights and help in shaping practices at international, national, sectoral, and corporate levels. The paper follows a macro-conceptual to a micro-empirical path to provide illustrative empirical evidence. Studying the emergence and evolution of Danish Textile and Fashion Industry (DTFI) between 1945 and 2015—a quintessential sector for globalization—allows the examination of several interrelated issues: critical events, impediments, pressures, and turning points that shaped DTFI; main institutional players that motivated key policy changes in and evolution of DTFI; and effects of late globalization on size, mission, location, knowledge, growth, and structure of DTFI. This longitudinal case study of the development of the DTFI brings to the fore key features that shape late globalization at the sectoral-national level: government industrial policies toward domestic and foreign players in an industry, global competition that shapes and continually reshapes (cost as well as quality-driven) location of key value chain activities (and the concomitant global distribution of core competencies and skills), and the growing role of information technologies that enable globally-dispersed value chains to function in cohesive and unified ways. Late globalization has additional levels and dimensions; and we point to implications for future research. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Denmark; industrial policy; industry emergence; industry evolution; international business policy; late globalization; textile and fashion; theory building",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086331228

While most studies focus on effect measures, little is known about process-related factors shaping the outcomes of interventions. In this article, the authors suggest that success in implementing organisational interventions is tied to microsocial mechanisms that affect whether engagement and creativity materialise into improvements. In this regard, interaction within intervention activities has been overlooked as relevant data sources. To exemplify how these may be useful, video-recorded interactions between participants in an intervention workshop setting are analysed. The framework focuses on threats to the participants’ face (i.e. their public self-image), the participants “facework”, and on how social action is oriented to deontic, epistemic and emotional domains of order. The analysis shows how threats to the participants’ faces arise in interaction, diverting the focus of discussions away from the aim of the workshops; developing initiatives to improve employees’ health and safety. The analysis highlights that participatory interventions may be ineffective if potential face threats are not mitigated and managed actively. We suggest that the manager-facilitator-employee communicational design should be an area of increased focus. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, such employees are likely to identify with the stakeholders they reach out to which exposes them to potentially conflicting demands—with positive or negative effects for their employing organization. We investigate whether and how their dual identification with the organization and with users, and the potential identity conflicts this engenders, affects their job satisfaction and innovativeness. We study a sample of 243 employees in two industries, revealing that perceived conflict between organizational identification and user identification detracts from job satisfaction if and only if employees are strongly identified with both targets. We find also that identity conflict is indirectly and negatively related to innovative work behavior through job satisfaction. Our paper contributes to the literature on the benefits and risks of employee ties to external stakeholders. We contribute also to research on embedded users by elucidating under what conditions they are most valuable to their employing organizations. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","boundary spanner; identification; innovation; job satisfaction; user innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085067386

The emissions-intensity of grid electricity becomes more important as these BSSs are more widely employed. In this paper, we introduce a novel data basis for the determination of the energy system's CO2 emissions, which is a match between the ENTSO-E database and the EUTL databases. We further postulate four different dynamic emission factors (EF) to determine the hourly CO2 emissions caused through a change in electricity demand: the average emission factor (AEF), the marginal power mix (MPM), the marginal system response (MSR) and an energy-model-derived marginal power plant (MPP). For generic and battery storage systems, a linear optimization on two levels optimizes the economic and environmental storage dispatch for a set of 50 small and medium enterprises in Germany. The four different emission factors have different signaling effects. The AEF leads to the lowest CO2 reduction and allows for roughly two daily cycles. The other EFs show a higher volatility, which leads to a higher utilization of the storage system from 3.4 to 5.4 daily cycles. The minimum mean value for CO2 abatement costs over all 50 companies is 14.13 €/tCO2. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; CO2-minimizing dispatch; Dynamic emission factors; Empirical emission factors; Energy storage system; German industry","Battery storage; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Linear programming; Battery storage system; Electricity demands; Emission factors; Emissions intensity; Grid electricity; Linear optimization; Model based approach; Small and medium enterprise; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084637913

The framework is hierarchical and combines key evaluation aspects in one integrated approach. The framework will enable industries transition towards more sustainable production, providing users with the opportunity to evaluate and support decisions on not only a financial basis, but also from a comprehensive techno-economic and sustainability angle. To this end, the framework collects relevant aspects within the sustainability field and addresses concepts such as circular economy, resource recovery, and waste management. This research also aims to add additional relevant inputs for increasing the possibilities to reach the scope of cleaner production.

We adopt a theory building mode and conduct an in-depth case study, following an innovation project in the IT sector with a series of facilitated creativity workshops. Our results show that neutrality is a multi-dimensional construct that interacts with several outcome dimensions of facilitation, i.e. people, process, and product. We introduce a pro-active neutrality framework, which explains the mechanisms of neutrality in facilitation and thereby extend theory on both neutrality and facilitation.

Drawing on interviews with local stakeholders, the paper argues that destination development stage and the relative importance of land-based tourism frame the ways in which stakeholders perceive the sustainability of cruise tourism. While there were differences in the emphasis placed on environmental, socio-cultural and economic aspects of sustainability in each destination, there were similarities in the ways in which stakeholders conceptualised relations between the different aspects in terms of trade-offs and competition, together with a lack of a holistic perspective and concern about economic dependence on global cruise lines.

By analysing the long-term political dynamic surrounding public procurement in Denmark, Germany and the UK since the implementation of the revised 2014 public procurement directive, we show how both national actors, and actors at subnational level, where much public procurement actually takes place, contest the Europeanization of public policies. Variation in the willingness and ability of actors to leverage the legal uncertainty to adopt labour clauses results in diverging policy trajectories, but also creates a room for policy innovation.

Firms strive to manage risk, handle unexpected disruptions and improve performance in ever changing uncertain business environments. This paper builds upon the information processing view of risk management and explores the association between supply chain integration (SCI) and supply chain risk management (SCRM) to improve operational performance. Subsequently, the mediating role played by SCRM between SCI and firms’ operational performance is examined. In this paper, covariance-based structural equation modeling is applied to test the developed hypotheses using data of 931 manufacturing companies obtained from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI). The findings of the study suggest that internal, supplier and customer integration positively effects SCRM whereas the impact of internal integration is also partially mediated by supplier and customer integration. Additionally, the results present that SCRM partially mediates the relationship between internal integration and operational performance and fully mediates the association between supplier and customer integration and operational performance.

Focusing on the institutional and procedural design of these two platforms, we highlight the factors and incentives that might contribute to increasing consumers’ trust and traders’ engagement in ODR procedures. The article relies on a large dataset from Consumidor.gov.br, consisting of a sample of more than 800,000 consumer complaints. While the EU ODR platform is not yet very well known among EU consumers, the Brazilian platform is becoming widely popular among Brazilian consumers. It is put forward that this popularity could be the result of the procedural design of the Brazilian platform, which serves as a direct communication channel between the trader and the consumer. Furthermore, we argue that the EU ODR platform could be more effective if the incentives for both parties, traders and consumers, to use ODR were reinforced.

The importance of this endeavor urges researchers to investigate the sharing economy more fully through different applications, primarily including transportation and customer service. However, these studies fail to attempt to explore the perspectives of the sharing economy through industrial applications. Industrial sectors are more prone towards negative sustainability; hence, it is necessary to address strategies to promote and to implement the sharing economy with an industrial perspective. Hence, this study seeks to identify the barriers of sharing economy implementation in industries, particularly with small and medium scale enterprises (SME) located in India. Common barriers are identified through the combined assistance of literature review and experts' opinions. These common barriers are shortlisted through Best Worst Method (BWM) and further analyzed through proposed solution methodology, DEMATEL, with the support of case industrial managers. Among 15 shortlisted barriers of sharing economy, “Lack of trust” was identified as the most influential and “Capital cost” was identified as the least influential barriers. This study contributes to both academic and practitioner levels by identifying the most common barriers of the industrial sharing economy. Further, we present strategies so practitioners can evade such barriers through customized practices instead of providing a generic treatment. In addition, this study provides a new approach to the literature; insight into the ‘industrial sharing economy’ could be a scientific breakthrough for upcoming studies. Finally, the study concludes with various useful recommendations and suggestions on the implementation of sharing economy in industries, particularly with SMEs. These recommendations shed light into various key research areas, which can be examined more fully in future studies. © 2019","Barriers; Best worst method; DEMATEL; Industrial sharing economy; SDG's","Costs; Planning; Sustainable development; Barriers; Best worst method; DEMATEL; Industrial sharing economy; SDG's; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079349784

It exemplifies how integration of a restaurant into a specific attraction theme provides opportunities for experience value co-creation through tourism practices. It also illustrates how integration can cause co-destruction of experience value. The action-oriented part of the study included a workshop, interviews and other communication with relevant actors. It aimed to sustain a change of practices, providing solutions to issues of value-co-destruction found in the case study. The article theorises and illustrates the complexity of experience value creation in complex tourist settings and suggests how a practice theory approach to innovation may lead to value creation in tourism and be a powerful tool for tourism managers. © The Author(s) 2020.","attractions; experience; innovation; practice; restaurants; tourism; value creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078208354

The effects of these practices on participants have been theorized in terms of identity regulation and resistance, yet in our view the situated accomplishments of authority and identity remain inadequately theorized. This study follows a number of such practices as texts and conversations, and shows how a programme participant’s leader identity becomes authorized and acknowledged as participants and instructors ventriloquize texts in conversations. We theorize this as identity reconfiguration, as it entails the continual staging and authorizing of diverse figures.

In contrast, this study investigates how individual employees rely on both internal and external knowledge to increase their innovative work output (and, secondarily, their customer acquisition performance) and how their supervising manager’s characteristics moderate these mechanisms. Using hierarchical linear modeling of data collected from 123 employees and 50 managers in telecommunications companies in the emerging market of Vietnam, we find support for our hypothesized relationships.

Although some concern has been raised about the effectiveness of such partnerships, little is known about their actual impact. Often it is assumed that partnership outputs transform straightforwardly into societal impact such as poverty alleviation. This article problematizes this assumption. Employing a critical micro-level study, which draws on a qualitative case study of a nongovernmental organization (NGO)–business partnership in Ghana, we examine how outputs provided by a partnership are put to use and perceived as beneficial from the point of view of its beneficiaries. The findings show that the partnership results in what we term “competences without agency” since it provides new resources and knowledge to the beneficiaries but fails to generate the conditions for these to be transformed into significant changes in their lives. Drawing on the concept of empowerment, we propose a new framework, which conceptualizes “impact as empowerment” and highlights currently unrecognized dynamics, which contribute to shaping the ability of a partnership to serve as a development agent. © The Author(s) 2019.","capitalism; corporate social responsibility; development agent; North–South; partnership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064939801

The New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition (NA) was launched in 2012 and provides a governance framework for partnerships between donors, governments, and companies that applies principles and practices of market-led growth as means to the end of inclusive development. Through an in-depth, multilevel analysis that juxtaposes the NA’s stipulated framework with the lived experiences of smallholder farmers in Malawi, one of ten African countries to participate in NA, the paper shows how local consequences are decoupled from global goals through governance gaps in both the horizontal and vertical dynamics of implementation. This decoupling of intention and consequence, we argue, happens at the national level of translating global principles into local practices. On the basis of this analysis, we suggest that vertical and horizontal governance must be integrated in one framework. Thus, we contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the theory and practice of the organization of development by introducing a framework of transglocal governance. © The Author(s) 2019.","development governance; governance gaps; land deals; Malawi; multilevel governance; New Alliance for Food Safety and Nutrition; postcolonial critique; transglocal governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063319799

Analyses on the Australian Public Service (APS) employee census support these assertions. Our results contribute to the literatures on work behavior, organizational innovation, and human resources management, by demonstrating that multiple organizational changes negatively affect managerial support for IWB of individual employees, which may—through their negative impact on individual-level innovations—ultimately affect the very adaptability of organizations that many changes aspire to achieve. © The Author(s) 2019.","Australian Public Service; innovative work behavior; multiple organizational changes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061581766

We test these ideas using a factorial survey of the effects of clan ties on recruitment and selection processes in Kazakhstan.

To support the authors’ arguments, publicly available secondary data sources were used, including newsletters, press releases and websites, reports from key players within the accounting profession, public documents issued by the European Commission and data from corporatergister.com. Findings: To become a de facto standard or framework, a private standard-setter requires the support of corporate regulators to mandate it in a specific national jurisdiction. The de facto standard-setter requires a powerful coalition of actors who can influence the policymakers to allow its adoption and diffusion at a national level to become mandated. Without regulatory support, it is difficult for a private and voluntary reporting standard or framework to be adopted and diffused. Moreover, the authors report that the <IRF> preferences stock market capitalism over sustainability because it privileges organisational sustainability over social and environmental sustainability, emphasises value creation over holding organisations accountable for their impact on society and the environment and privileges the entitlements of providers of financial capital over other stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: The authors question the suitability of the goals of both the <IRF> and the EU Directive during and after the COVID-19 crisis. The planned changes to both need rethinking as we head into uncharted waters. Moreover, the authors believe that the people cannot afford any more reporting façades. Originality/value: The authors offer a critical analysis of the link between the <IRF> and the EU Directive and how the <IRF> can be used to comply with the EU Directive. By questioning the relevance of the compliance question, the authors advance a critique about the relevance of these and other legal and de facto frameworks, particularly considering the more pressing needs that must be met to address the economic, social and environmental implications of the COVID-19 crisis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate reporting; Directive 2014/95/EU; Integrated reporting; Reporting façade; Reporting integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088699901

Design/methodology/approach: Legitimacy theory is used to identify disclosure strategies pursued by firms in reaction to the new regulation. To understand how firms adopt these strategic responses, semiotic analysis is applied to a sample of European companies’ reports through Crowther’s (2012) framework, which is based on a mechanism of binary oppositions. Findings: Half of the sample strategically choose to comply with the European Union (EU) Directive regarding BM information through the use of non-accounting language, figures, and diagrams. Other firms did not disclose any substantive information but managed the impression of compliance with the regulation, while the remainder of the sample dismissed the regulation altogether. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates how organisations use the disclosure of BM information in their corporate reports to control their legitimacy. The results support the idea that firms can acquire legitimacy by complying with the law or giving the impression of compliance with the regulation. This study provides evidence on the first-time adoption of the EU Directive, and therefore, future research can enlarge the sample and conduct the analysis over a broader time frame. Practical implications: A more precise indication of the EU Directive regarding “where” firms should report BM information, “how” the description of a BM should refer to the environmental, social, governance (ESG) factors, and a set of performance measures to track the evolution of a company’s BM overtime is needed. Originality/value: While there has been a notable amount of research that has applied content analysis methodologies to investigate the thematic and syntactic aspects of BM disclosure in corporate reports, only a few studies have investigated BM disclosures in relation to the EU Directive. Furthermore, the application of semiotic analysis extends beyond traditional content analysis methodologies because it considers the structure of the story at many levels, thus developing a more complete textual picture of how BMs are described, allowing an analysis of the reasons behind the disclosure strategies pursued by firms. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business model; European Directive 2014/95; Legitimacy theory; Non-financial information; Semiotic analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087854340

The love of a sports team is a type of brand love and is a valuable context to study of brand love intensity because the intensity of love can become more extreme than for products; it has two distinctive features that are theoretically, management and policy relevant; and it is an under-researched context in marketing that is socially and economically significant. Design/methodology/approach: The authors empirically develop and test a multidimensional hierarchical higher-order measure of the intensity of team love and a model of its drivers and outcomes using a sample of supporter club members of a professional sports team who vary in their intensity of love for the team. Findings: The results support our measurement model and its distinctive features, especially the importance of the perceived two-way bond fans have with their team. While overall intensity of team love is not related to social influence or on-field performance, as hypothesized, they are related to sub-dimensions of team love, reflecting its multidimensionality. As hypothesized, the intensity of team love and social influence are related to the intention to renew club membership even with increased costs and poor performance and social influence is directly related to word of mouth and game attendance. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to the club members of one sports team in a particular sport in one country and one cultural context. Future research opportunities include: extending it to other sports and brand contexts, refining the methodology and addressing other issues highlighted by the research. Practical implications: The results indicate the limits of management control of team love intensity because it develops over time independently through social processes. However, firms can help facilitate these processes. The social dimensions indicate the need to develop socially, as well as individually-focussed relationship management strategies. Most devoted fans are valuable customers, but some hardcore elements can be dysfunctional and sabotage the brand. Social implications: Sport is personally, social and economically significant in most cultures and love of a sports team love can be an important glue that binds people and communities. However, the existence of extreme hardcore fans and heated rivalries can also be divisive and pose challenges for social policy. Hence, the need to better understand the factors driving more extreme forms of team love to better inform the development of social policy. Originality/value: The authors focus on the intensity of brand love rather than its presence and absence as in prior research. The authors develop and test a new hierarchical measure of sports team love intensity and a model of its drivers and outcomes. The sports context is under-researched in marketing but reveals the important role played by dimensions that are obscured in studies of product brand love – its social nature and the perceived reciprocal relation with devoted fans. The results contribute to developing extended theories of brand love, open up new research opportunities and have management and policy implications. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand love intensity; Extreme brand love; Hierarchical measurement model; Social influence; Sports team love; Two-way bond",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087552027

We have developed a data processing pipeline, which precompiles a large amount of motion capture trials into a parametric model relying on the correlations between the input variables. The compilation converts optical motion capture data into anatomical joint angle variations and anatomical body dimensions. Finally, a quadratic programming method with a closed-form solution is developed to predict motion patterns meeting subject-specific requirements. The method is demonstrated on running models, and we conclude that the method can facilitate new uses of biomechanical models. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.","Anthropometry; Principal Component Analysis; Running; Statistics","Biomechanics; Motion capture; Quadratic programming; Bio-mechanical models; Closed form solutions; Data processing pipelines; Motion capture data; Optical motion capture; Parametric modeling; Quadratic programming method; Subject-specific; Data handling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091262144

The present paper combines both perspectives by investigating how different types of network brokers facilitate business networking and knowledge-sharing in organisationally thin regions. Design/methodology/approach: Burt's theory on brokers in social networks is applied to knowledge-sharing in business networks for organisational thinness as context. A qualitative case study represents the empirical basis that describes network brokers from various domains in three different German case regions, which are characterised by organisational thinness. Findings: The network brokers studied facilitate different types of business networks, and they use various levers to increase knowledge-sharing among companies in business networks. Two broker types emerge, private business-driven versus public policy-driven network brokers with distinct approaches to the facilitation of business networking and knowledge-sharing and different limitations due to organisational thinness. Practical implications: Companies, notably SMEs, in contexts characterised by low networking density and quality may benefit from various types of network brokers that foster business networking and instigate knowledge exchange. Public policy should embed activities of private brokers in existing SME assistance programmes to increase the quantity and quality of business networks.

Thus, the work was developed in three phases: i) a theoretical phase, ii) a validation phase and iii) a statistical analysis. For the theoretical phase, a literature review was conducted to determine a set of competencies for developing these type of projects. Next, in the validation phase, fifty participants were invited to complete a two-round Delphi questionnaire to rank the competencies detected in the literature review. The participants were classified according to their level of knowledge (skilled or expert) and place of work (countries with upper-middle-income or high-income). The results showed that twenty-one competencies were identified. In the validation phase, for the first Delphi round, the different groups studied (skilled vs expert; high-income vs upper-middle-income) did not agree about the most important competencies. However, after the second Delphi round, an agreement was achieved. Therefore, competencies related to water quality and process design for improving its quality were defined as “extremely important” competencies. In addition, the entire panel of experts also highlighted competencies related to legislation, circular economy, equipment, climate, and construction materials. Thus, for the first time, a set of competencies that needs to be included in educational programs for engineers with a special focus on developing water infrastructure based on NBS in the urban context of developing countries has been proposed in this work. © 2020","Delphi methodology; Developing countries; Engineering education; Nature-based solutions; Urban water infrastructure","Construction equipment; Developing countries; Laws and legislation; Water quality; Circular economy; Educational program; Engineering program; ITS applications; Literature reviews; Middle incomes; Validation phase; Water infrastructure; Application programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084070859

The typology is explained, elaborated and discussed with the aim to reach a deeper understanding of value adding management in the context of FM and CREM. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on FM and CREM literature, a survey with 15 expert interviews from six different European countries and cases with examples of interventions from earlier research. Findings: The typology consists of six types of interventions, some mainly product-related, some mainly process-related and some that can be both. Each type is underpinned by examples from a case company and from interviews. Research limitations/implications: The number of interviews is limited. The typology with related interventions is not necessarily complete. However, the typology is regarded to include the most important interventions in the current state of practice of FM and CREM. Practical implications: The typology provides an overview of the different ways FM and CREM can add value. The cases and examples can be used as inspiration for developing specific interventions in practice. Originality/value: The typology is the first to provide a classification of FM and CREM interventions. By integrating findings from interviews and case studies, this typology contributes to a better understanding and practicing of value adding management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Added value; Corporate real estate management; Facilities management; Interventions; Typology; Value adding management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079113951

In times past many resources could be found in abundance: intellectual, financial, social and natural capital domains alike. Population growth was generally slow and total human population was well below the carrying capacity of the planet. In such times, enterprise consideration for social and environmental performance was generally quite low and the upper boundaries of those considerations were generally by legal or other external means, rather by an internal conscience. Times have changed, with positive and negative elements of change. Many of the social, environmental, and enterprise challenges that enterprises and we as individuals are confronted by are far too large, with consequences far too extreme to be approached without help. Rapid, highly-innovative, and highly-productive collaboration is needed. A key pre-condition for such collaboration is trust, with higher trust levels leading to higher levels of cyclical virtuous or positive reciprocal behaviour.

The purpose of this paper is to focus on the approach of linking development of professional capital to the development of team competence through facilitating and discuss the adequacy of the methods used to fulfil the purpose. Design/methodology/approach: This study was designed as a multiple case intervention implemented at four worksites. It was organized as a course consisting of four sessions among 15–20 team coordinators from each school unit. The research group provided insights and methods to increase the team’s ability to manage tasks and cooperate. Findings: Based on observations of team meetings, the study provides a discussion on the usefulness of the approach of linking team competence and professional capital. Both at theoretical and practical levels, the study finds it is meaningful to combine facilitating as methods to ensure the creation of value in organizational teamwork, in general, with the concept of professional capital pointing on the quality of the core task and particularly developed within an educational context. Research limitations/implications: The study provide a presentation of two theoretical frameworks and a discussion of the adequacy of linking these frameworks to the development of team competences in a school context. Practical implications: The study suggests that organizations and educational institutions (of teachers, physicians, and social workers) may benefit from linking professional capital and facilitating and thereby provide employees and students training in professional collaboration. Social implications: In a still more complex society, collaboration is crucial. The study suggests ways to improve collaboration, quality of the core task along with the relational dimensions in the psychosocial work environment. Originality/value: Development of professional capital through increased team competences and facilitating skills represents a new and promising approach with theoretical as well as practical implications within a school context. Indeed, not only school teams but also teams in other organizations dealing with social- task- and contextual complexity can benefit from the insights and experiences of this study. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Collaboration skills; Complexity theory; Decision capital; Facilitating; Facilitation; Facilitators; Intervention study; Municipal schools; Professional capital; Social capital; Team co; Team competences; Team coordinators; Team meetings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088837249

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses structural equation modeling to analyze data from 408 different firms in the Danish production and services sectors. A dyadic approach is applied, as a sub-sample of 107 chief operating officers in the responding firms is used to investigate the construct validity, reliability and average deviation index of the instrument measuring the roles of finance functions. Findings: The paper finds that lean-operation firms emphasize four different yet interdependent roles of finance functions. The paper also finds that lean operation leads to firms’ finance functions adopting lean principles. Research limitations/implications: This paper characterizes lean-operation firms as contextually ambidextrous to predict relations between lean operation and roles of finance functions. The paper expands prior case study findings on the roles of finance functions in lean-operation firms, and the findings of the paper underline that finance functions continue to play an important role in these firms. Practical implications: Decision-makers in lean-operation firms should not be hesitant with respect to integrating finance function workers into the lean operation. Furthermore, decision-makers should understand that a balanced emphasis of the roles of finance functions is necessary to avoid overemphasizing exploitation at the expense of exploration, or vice versa. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first paper to provide large-scale evidence of the roles of finance functions in lean-operation firms and to show that lean principles diffuse to finance functions.

In this explorative study, we provide new empirical evidence to the innovation speed literature. We examine to what extent innovation speed is affected by organisational, technological, and relational contingencies that preoccupy firms with open innovation practices. Taking the firm perspective, we track innovation timeline and emphasise the complex trade-offs that firms encounter while innovating. Our results show that many of the contingencies, emphasised by the literature promoting innovation, could slow down its speed. Thus, strengthening competitiveness by accommodating contingencies can hinder time-critical adaptations.

Design/methodology/approach: By means of an intervention, lean tools integrated with OHS elements were introduced in four Bangladeshi key garment suppliers of a Danish buyer. By employing a qualitative approach, both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used to collect data on productivity, OHS, and buyer–supplier efforts. Findings: This study demonstrates that lean tools, integrated with OHS elements, can be used to improve the productivity and compliance capabilities of supplier firms, which meet a buyers' changing demands for lower prices, shorter lead times, and higher compliance standards. This study suggests that the improvement of productivity and OHS in supplier firms through lean implementation could be a better choice for buyers than switching to new suppliers with uncertainties in productivity and delivery, as well as OHS compliance problems. Practical implications: The findings of this study suggest that garment suppliers can benefit from implementing lean, thereby improving their capacity to meet buyers' expectations. Therefore, both suppliers and buyers have a mutual interest in the application of lean in suppliers' production facilities.

The purpose of this paper is to review the entrepreneurship education literature to understand how context has been addressed, derives contextual elements from prioritized literature and explores how context can be adapted to and designed with in entrepreneurship education. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review is undertaken to explore context in entrepreneurship education literature. Context entrepreneurship education yielded 239 items. After refinement, 232 entrepreneurship education associated publications were reviewed by the team of authors. Using selection criteria, 26 prioritized publications were analyzed and categorized according to a theoretical framework. Findings: Context has been addressed both conceptually and empirically, quantitatively and qualitatively, and can be categorized across three sociological phenomena levels – micro, meso and macro. Within these levels, more specific context elements emerge from the entrepreneurship education literature. The findings assert that while context is highly influential in relation to entrepreneurship education, it is arbitrarily described, and holds a variety of documented and diffuse elements. Educators have a limited span of control in relation to context elements, however, for the most parts elements can be adapted to or designed with. Finally, due to the influence of context it is difficult to identify a universal best practice of entrepreneurship education because there simply is no ceteris paribus. Research limitations/implications: Contextual elements which emerged from the literature consider various subjects, spaces, structures and networks. Context is complex and has had limited treatment in entrepreneurship education literature, thus additional analysis and experimentation is necessary. Practical implications: Context shapes understanding and influences learning.

Before the advent of big data management systems (e.g. Cassandra) and frameworks (e.g. Spark), organizations had to cope with large data volumes with custom-tailored solutions. In particular, a decade ago, Tecgraf/PUC-Rio developed a system to monitor truck fleet in real-time and proactively detect events from the positioning data received. Over the years, the system evolved into a complex and large obsolescent code base involving a costly maintenance process. [Goal] We report our experience on replacing a legacy BDS with a microservice-based event-driven system. [Method] We applied action research, investigating the reasons that motivate the adoption of a microservice-based event-driven architecture, intervening to define the new architecture, and documenting the challenges and lessons learned. [Results] We perceived that the resulting architecture enabled easier maintenance and faultisolation. However, the myriad of technologies and the complex data flow were perceived as drawbacks. Based on the challenges faced, we highlight opportunities to improve the design of big data reactive systems. [Conclusions] We believe that our experience provides helpful takeaways for practitioners modernizing systems with data-intensive requirements. © 2020 IEEE.","big data system; event-driven; microservices","Application programs; Big data; Computer architecture; Fleet operations; Data management system; Data-intensive systems; Event-driven architectures; Event-driven system; Large data volumes; Maintenance process; Performance quality; Tailored Solutions; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096582582

This study investigates whether the poor long-term labor market outcomes experienced by women who first gave birth before turning 25 reflect previously existing disadvantages or are a consequence of the timing of childbearing. The purpose is also to observe whether a new combination of the best identification practices from earlier studies serves as an improved estimation method. This is done by applying a within-family estimator while treating miscarriages as an exogenous variation, thereby addressing family and individual heterogeneity, which might have biased earlier results based on either of the two identification strategies alone.

A close examination of past findings reveals discrepancies across cultures. This meta-analysis provides insights into the moderating effects of national culture on the frontline role process. We build on role theory to consolidate role behavior’s antecedents to reflect the expectations emanating from four stakeholders of the frontline role: the organization, manager, peers, and customers. We formulate hypotheses on the moderating effects of national culture dimensions (i.e., power distance, individualism, masculinity, and uncertainty avoidance) and meta-analyze 105 articles, including 100 independent samples with 32,364 participants from 35 different countries, to test our predictions. The results show that customer expectations are the strongest antecedent to both in-role and extra-role behavior and furthermore confirm that the frontline role process differs across cultures. We offer managers advice on how to adapt expectations for sales and service employees across countries to enhance frontline performance evaluations, customer satisfaction, and ultimately the firm’s competitiveness.

Alternative cropping systems in this region must be explored because traditional winter wheat and summer maize (WW-SM) rotation is maintained at the cost of high consumption of irrigation water and N loss to the environment. In this study, a soil–crop system model (WHCNS, soil water heat carbon and N simulator) and a life cycle assessment were integrated to analyze and evaluate water footprint (WF) and N footprint (NF) for alternative cropping systems of wheat and maize (2H1Y_FP, two harvests in 1 year with farmer's practice; 2H1Y_RI, two harvests in 1 year with reduced inputs; 1H1Y, one harvest in 1 year with reduced inputs; and 3H2Y, three harvests in 2 years with reduced inputs) in the NCP. Results showed that NH3 volatilization and NO3 − leaching are the main hot spots of NF for different crops. For the composition of WF, blue and green WF contributed largely to the total WF of wheat and maize, respectively, and the proportion of gray WF for maize could be decreased by 30% with the reduction in fertilizer amount. The yearly average NF (kg N-eq t−1 y−1) showed the following order: 1H1Y (2.65) &lt;3H2Y (3.41) &lt;2H1Y_RI (6.15) &lt;2H1Y_FP (17.46), and the yearly average WF (m3 t−1 y−1) showed the same order as follows: 1H1Y (565.22) &lt;3H2Y (830.15) &lt;2H1Y_RI (1162.19) &lt;2H1Y_FP (1633.18). Among the compared cropping systems, the 1H1Y and 3H2Y modes as potential alternatives to traditional WW-SM cropping systems showed advantages of sustaining groundwater exploitation and mitigating groundwater nitrate contamination in the NCP.

However, a major bottleneck for successful and cost-effective bioaugmentation is the lack of ready-to-use, specialized methanogenic cultures when required. The reason is the slow growth of the anaerobic consortia and the high cost of maintaining them active in the necessary amounts for successful bioaugmentation applications. This study offers an effective procedure where customized AD inocula could be preserved and used on-demand for remediation of ammonia inhibited AD reactors. Additionally, it introduces the biological and physicochemical mechanisms that render the long-term preservation of the AD inocula possible. Specifically, two different preservation carriers (i.e. agar gel and liquid basic anaerobic medium) were assessed at two different temperatures (i.e. 4 °C and 24 °C) using an ammonia tolerant methanogenic consortium. The results from methane production, lag-phase, maximum methane production rate and cell viability indicate that the consortium preserved for 168 days in agar gel at 24 °C performed best compared to the other tested preservation conditions. Meanwhile, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis indicated that Methanosarcina soligelidi and Methanoculleus palmolei shown a high revival rate and metabolic activity after long-term preservation. Thus, this successful long-term preservation method of ready-to-use AD consortia could render the successful bioaugmentation in full-scale biogas reactors economically possible in the near future. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia tolerant; Cell entrapment; Gel preservation; Methanosarcina soligelidi; Revival rate","Algae; Ammonia; Cost effectiveness; Methane; Polysaccharides; Remediation; RNA; 16S rRNA sequencing analysis; Anaerobic consortia; Long-term preservation; Methane production; Methanogenic consortium; Methanogenic cultures; Physico-chemical mechanisms; Preservation condition; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083223568

Yet, succeeding in product innovation for such ventures is challenging due to various uncertainties pertaining to product development, potential demand and sustainability impact of their products. This study investigates how sustainability-oriented ventures engage in product innovation processes; in doing so, it builds upon the theory of effectuation, as a useful approach to decision-making under uncertainty. A longitudinal case study on four sustainability-oriented ventures revealed two different approaches to product innovation in such ventures, namely adaptive and exaptive approaches. While an adaptive approach is characterized by a long-term value proposition a venture engages in, and high fidelity design experiments used to get the commitment of a select number of stakeholders to develop this predefined value proposition, an exaptive approach is characterized by short-term multiple value propositions a venture engages in, and low-fidelity affordable design experiments used to test market potential of these propositions through various stakeholder interactions. Moreover, the way new ventures define their value propositions in relation to sustainability appears to influence the approach they adopt for the product innovation process. While the ambition to transform a particular market towards sustainable practices causes ventures to anchor on a target market, which appears to stimulate an adaptive approach, the ambition to develop a product that can replace existing products or provide similar sustainability benefits in a number of markets causes firms to anchor on a product idea, which appears to stimulate an exaptive approach. We conclude that future studies should explore the implications of different approaches in order to identify best practices for new ventures engaged in product innovation for sustainability. © 2020","Effectuation; New ventures; Product innovation; Sustainability-orientation","Commerce; Decision making; Decision theory; Decision making under uncertainty; Design experiments; Longitudinal case study; Product innovation; Product innovation process; Sustainability impacts; Sustainable practices; Sustainable products; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083181815

We argue that the most cited theoretical arguments for the presence of long memory do not imply the fractional difference operator and assess the performance of the autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model when forecasting series with long memory generated by nonfractional models. We find that ARFIMA models dominate in forecast performance regardless of the long memory generating mechanism and forecast horizon. Nonetheless, forecasting uncertainty at the shortest forecast horizon could make short memory models provide suitable forecast performance, particularly for smaller degrees of memory. Additionally, we analyze the forecasting performance of the heterogeneous autoregressive (HAR) model, which imposes restrictions on high-order AR models. We find that the structure imposed by the HAR model produces better short and medium horizon forecasts than unconstrained AR models of the same order.

While luxury is a well-researched area in the domain of consumer goods, research on more consumer-focused forms of luxury is still nascent. Yet today luxury experiences drive the development of luxury markets and inconspicuous, private consumption of luxury is rising. In order to address these developments, this special issue moves beyond conventional understandings of luxury as involving conspicuous status consumption of tangible goods, and focuses instead on how consumers may experience, give, produce, or share luxury, and what luxuriousness implies. The various articles in the special issue addresses topics such as intangible services, hedonic escapes, and everyday pleasures. They also include alternative understandings of exclusivity, and of common goods that have become scarce over time. Together, the articles in the special issue combine to present a broader understanding both of what luxury can be and of what luxury might do for consumers. While previous conventional luxury understanding focus on exclusive status consumption, the different articles in this special issue instead introduce consumer perceptions of luxury for which conventional luxury attributes look markedly or even entirely different. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Luxury; Luxury consumption; Luxury experiences; Unconventional luxury",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079043653

We argue that elections have opposing effects on the risk of coup attempts, depending on the state of the economy in which they are held. Elections occurring in conditions of economic crisis spur anti-government mobilization and high levels of state repression. This increases the subsequent risk of coup attempts. Conversely, elections held during economic expansion induce pro-government mobilization and waning repression, which reduces the subsequent risk of coups. We find strong support for these propositions in a statistical analysis of 130 countries that conducted contested elections in the period 1952 to 2013. The results are robust to an array of model specifications, including when we account for election outcome, postelection economic performance, and the possibility that both elections and economic performance are endogenous to coup attempts. © The Author(s) 2020.","coup attempts; economic crisis; elections; protest; state repression",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078200699

However, finding the right degree of openness is challenging, especially in complex open innovation ecosystems. The interdependencies and dynamics related to the choice of openness are not well-understood. This paper investigates the role of openness as a competitive mechanism. Specifically, we research how openness affects firms' interactions with user communities and how it changes the preference structure of customers. We build a longitudinal case study in the open source gaming handheld industry and trace the evolution and the dynamics of firms, user communities, and their interactions. We find that a suboptimal level of openness can pose a threat to a firm's very existence. Further, we identify repeated patterns characterizing the dynamics in the ecosystem. Based on these patterns, we propose a framework of the dynamics of openness. Our paper contributes to the literature on open innovation. We illuminate the relevance and the dynamics of openness as a dimension for competition.

Past research has focused mainly on understanding how CEO overpayment is related to firm performance. As a consequence, we know relatively little about the implications of paying excess compensation for other important firm outcomes such as corporate reputation. By analyzing a sample of S&P 100 firms over the period 1995–2010, we show that overpayment in total compensation has a weak positive effect on a firm’s reputation while overpayment in stock options has a significant and negative impact on corporate reputation. Moreover, we find that the negative impact of CEO excess compensation in stock options is augmented if there has been a CEO change during the previous year, whereas this effect is lessened by CEO tenure. These results demonstrate that the relationship between excessive CEO compensation and corporate reputation is complex. It is influenced by the type of compensation and by specific CEO characteristics that invite greater public attention and scrutiny. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CEO compensation; Corporate reputation; Excess compensation; Overpayment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054329396

However, the overwhelming number of platform complementors makes it impossible for platform operators to engage in extensive communication with each complementor about which content contributions are desired. Therefore, platform operators need to find a way to signal strategic interests to platform complementors. In this paper, we employ a mixed-methods design using data from the geodata platform OpenStreetMap to develop and test two distinct types of platform signals as a means of implementing a platform operator's strategy: (1) opportunity signals, which aim to stimulate activity in new areas of the platform, and (2) endorsement signals, which aim to increase activity in existing areas of the platform. In particular, we examine how platform signals influence the generation of platform content in terms of the volume and diversity of information on the platform. We contribute important insights to the platform governance literature by developing and empirically testing a signaling perspective on the generation of platform content and discussing its implications for guiding platform complementors in content creation. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

These findings suggests that, to harness the potentials associated with digital business strategy and agility while doing outsourcing or offshoring, clients may need to rely on long-term, embedded relationships vendors, on learning tasks and feedback, and on technologies that reduce complexity. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Erik Beulen and Pieter M.

Although past studies on channel choice have yielded insights into factors affecting consumers' channel preference, there is a dearth of research that sheds light on when and why massive investments into channel integration would be preferred over online optimizations. To this end, we construct and validate a theoretical model that posits omnichannel integration services for acquisition and recovery as predictors of consumers' online channel preference through influencing their perceptions of convenience and risk. Our experimental study reveals how distinct configurations of cross-channel service offerings affect consumers' channel evaluations and decisions, as well as how complementarities from channel integration across transaction and post-transaction phases can prevail over pure online substitutes. Consequently, this study bridges diagnostic and prescriptive research streams on multichannel and omnichannel retail by attesting to channel integration as a viable channel differentiator. From a practical standpoint, we compare 12 distinct channel configurations with regard to consumers' core evaluative criteria and highlight the value of omnichannel integration since efficiency improvements to the online channel can only serve as a partial substitute to channel integration. © 2020 University of Minnesota.

The author proposes that pragmatist philosophy may be a source of inspiration in this endeavor. Design/methodology/approach: The author revisits a 25-year-old case study in which the process of implementing an LO in a public enterprise was observed. This was in the heyday of LOs, when they were regarded as an organizational form that could provide solutions for almost all organizational problems. The author starts by considering this case using the first four types of understanding in Örtenblad’s LO taxonomy (2018): “learning at work,” “climate for learning,” “organizational learning” and “learning structure.” Then the author uses Örtenblad’s fifth version of LOs, the “social perspective,” to show that the pragmatist concepts of experience, inquiry and commitment are helpful in revealing and explaining how learning happens as part of the “social”. Findings: The author proposes the sixth version of Los, involving letting experience and inquiry loose. This is an extension of Örtenblad’s fifth version of LOs, which rests upon collective as the learning unit and learning as context-dependent cultural or social activity. The sixth version makes it possible to understand organizational learning and LOs as recursive processes of inquiry into tensions in experiences and the organizational affordances of voicing and enacting these tensions. Originality/value: Regarding LOs from a pragmatist perspective makes it possible to view learning as cultural and social activity without making learning a matter of either motivational persons for learning or organizations as “conducive” for learning, but understands the two as connected in recursive, iterative and rhythmic processes of tensions and resolutions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Learning organizations; Organizational learning; Practices; Pragmatism; Processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088576156

Pando, Canelones, Uruguay","Food waste is a major barrier to a sustainable society. Cleaner production is most effectively approached by amongst others avoiding waste. A lot of food waste is due to consumer perception of sub-optimality of foods, and supermarkets can offer ‘imperfect’ products to consumers at a reduced price in order to fight food waste. However, little is known about how this is perceived by consumers and whether it backfires as negative associations about the store, this is particularly under-researched for consumers in the global south. An online experimental survey was conducted in Uruguay to qualitatively explore consumer's associations with stores selling suboptimal food, and to quantitatively compare the associations generated by three types of sub-optimality. Findings revealed that associations were related to four main dimensions. Consumers majorly thought of which retail practices and personnel behaviour cause the sub-optimality and the relationship between consumers and company, as well as which signal the products send, and whether or not they consider choiceof the item. Few positive associations were mentioned. However, they emerged more often for fresh produce suboptimal in appearance, particularly when price is reduced, and among deal prone consumers. Associations on relationship and signal were primarily negative and in reaction to food with package damage. Associations on choice were more frequent for products nearing expiration date. Price reduction appeared to send a mixed signal to consumers. Results suggest that retailers should improve their overall image and communicate their precise reason for offering suboptimal food, in order to avoid a negative impact on store image. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Associations; Consumer behaviour; Food waste; Qualitative; Retail; Store image","Association reactions; Consumer behavior; Image enhancement; Pollution control; Retail stores; Sales; Cleaner production; Consumer perception; Experimental survey; Price reductions; Qualitative; Retail; Store image; Sustainable society; Food waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082800200

More specifically, the purpose is to study how the employees interpret certain historical events and values in their efforts to make sense of which heritage identity traits have remained meaningful for them over the passage of time and what these historical events and traits mean to their identification with the company. Design/methodology/approach: The investigation is based on 19 in-depth interviews with employees. A critical discourse analysis approach is adopted to uncover the discursive dynamics appearing across the employees' interpretations of historical events and values. Findings: The study indicates that heritage identity represent a complex and dynamic resource for employees' organizational identification. Therefore, this article argues that it could be a challenge for management to maintain a stable and enduring heritage identity, because the employees' interpretations and consequently their organizational identification is subject to continual revision and under influence by a dynamic and constantly changing social context. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study is limited to the specific context of one company. Further research could investigate the same topics when interviewing employees across the national borders of a global family company in times of change. Practical implications: Management need to identify whether different generations of employees develop a strong or weak identification with certain heritage identity traits and whether there are competing or compatible targets of heritage identification among these generations. Originality/value: This study illuminates the potential challenges related to the maintenance and preservation of heritage identity in a company with roots to a strong founding family, which operates in a constantly changing environment. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Critical discourse analysis; Employee interpretations; Founding values; Heritage identity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085615646

The time that lapses between a project’s start and its completion, is influenced not only by the firm's internal capabilities but also by how the firm connects to external knowledge. This paper assesses the relation between knowledge sourcing and lead-time advantage. Design/methodology/approach: This paper empirically tests the relation between external knowledge sourcing and lead-time advantage based on firm level Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data. Findings: I find that breadth and depth of the external knowledge sourcing are positively relating to lead-time advantage, albeit with diminishing returns. Investment into absorptive capacity, i.e. internal R&D, mitigates the diminishing of returns. Firms directing their external knowledge sourcing strategy toward consumers, suppliers and science are better able to capitalize on their innovations through lead-time advantages and firms also benefit from the special case of collaboration for product development. Originality/value: The conceptual novelty of this research largely consists in empirically bringing together for the first time conceptualizations of external knowledge sourcing and the strategic use of lead-time. Given the prevalence of both concepts in the modern and fast changing economy, investigating this link is of great importance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","External knowledge; Imitation; Innovation; Lead-time",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085880616

This has added to an already extensive list of challenges due to market size and the concept of economies of scale in AEC industry, to name but a few. Moreover, there is a myth that the AEC industry is bound to stay associated with build-to-order or made-to-order approach caused the AEC industry to restrict modularisation to the component level. This changes the balance in favour of what this paper calls a bottom-up approach. On the other hand, a valid alternative strategy–referred to in this study as top-down strategy–remains very much underexploited. The clients, therefore, do not have a neutral means by which they can assess which strategy is in their best interest. Likewise, if a construction company plans to make a strategic move towards the principles of modularisation and off-site manufacturing, they do not have clear decision support tools. This study investigates these two main modularisation strategies in the AEC industry to provide some examples of successful cases regarding how, when and where such strategy have been applied by different construction companies in different cases. The collected and collated empirical data and the results from the interviews will help clients and companies to analyse their own cases and make operational decisions on how, when and where to best utilise the bottom-up and top-down modularisation techniques while considering the pros and cons of such decisions. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","architecture; architecture, engineering and construction (AEC); bottom-up modularisation; industrialised building systems; Modularisation; top-down modularisation","Architecture; Construction industry; Economics; Architecture , engineering and constructions; Bottom up; Industrialised building systems; Modularisation; Topdown; Decision support systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081354070

This article examines how a specific regulatory policy change involving a restriction on work conditions affected Danish general medical practitioners’ (GPs) public service motivation (PSM). Using a three-wave survey panel in which the regulatory policy change occurred between the first two rounds of data collection, we find both short-term and long-term effects on the GPs’ PSM. Specifically, the GPs experienced a lasting decline in this type of motivation following the regulation. However, this was only with respect to their level of attraction to policymaking, public interest, and self-sacrifice, whereas their level of compassion increased in the short term. Results indicate that regulatory policies constraining the work conditions of frontline public service providers can indeed produce lasting negative motivational effects. © Copyright © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070258057

This article examines how the relationship between managers’ and employees’ organizational commitment depends on congruence between manager-intended and employee-perceived transformational leadership. Multilevel data from surveys of 75 principals and 1,470 teachers in Danish secondary education show that principals’ and teachers’ organizational commitment is positively related when principals are perceived to be transformational leaders and principals’ leadership intentions are congruent with the teachers’ perceptions. Organizationally committed managers who are not seen as transformational and/or who overrate their leadership relative to employees have a negative impact on employees’ organizational commitment. The results imply that public managers’ transformational leadership plays a critical role in conveying organizational commitment, but that it is equally important that they are aware of and responsive to their employees’ perceptions of leadership. © Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054526082

John Dewey’s broad view of habit, by contrast, conceptualizes habits as the very basis for how individuals interact with their environments, one another, and themselves. We highlight the renewed relevance of Dewey’s conceptualization of habit by clarifying it as (1) a function between individuals and environments; (2) a custom produced within social settings; (3) a process intertwined with inquiries and impulses. We illustrate each of these characteristics through the example of a French factory, within which we claim that the narrow view prevails, and a Danish IT company, within which we claim the presence of a broader view. We proceed to discuss consequences of the broad view to change management research. MAD statement This paper Make a Difference (MAD) by pointing to the relevance of looking at habit in understanding the microdynamics of change. Rather than understanding habit in a narrow sense as automatic behaviour triggers by environmental clues, the paper presents a broad conceptions of habit that understands habit as a social and materially disposition that both make change recipients resist and receptive towards change. This conception of habit is based on the work of the pragmatist philosophy and psychology of John Dewey, applied to two empirical cases and discussed in light of change management literature. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behaviourism; change management; Habit; John Dewey; Pragmatism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084325801

In a construction context, strategic partnerships, as a particular type of hybrid organisation, have given promises of increased productivity and innovation through business models combining logics and governance structures from both the public and private sectors. Little is however known about how strategic partnerships are established and develop throughout their lifespan by combining different logics in response to institutional complexity. Drawing on a study of a public client’s efforts to create cost efficient services, we analyse the formation of two strategic partnerships as emerging hybrid organisations in the intersection between a market logic, a project logic, a community logic, and an administrative logic. It is shown how different logics are mobilised in the dynamic shaping of the partnerships in response to moments of institutional complexity. On this background, we discuss how the contours of two different forms of hybrid organisation emerged, even though the partnerships initially operated and responded similarly to the institutional demands. On this basis, it is concluded that strategic partnerships can be seen as “trading zones” that follow different trajectories in coping with institutional demands, and hence the development of hybrid organisational forms. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Collaboration; complexity; hybrid organisations; institutional logics; strategic partnerships; trading zones","Commerce; Collaboration; complexity; hybrid organisations; Institutional logic; Strategic partnership; Mergers and acquisitions; administrative system; governance approach; local government; organizational framework; strategic approach; trade flow; trade relations; trajectory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081728777

This contribution unpacks the “SI ecosystems” concept, specifying how the empowerment afforded through SI networks rests on (1) local embedding, (2) transnational connectivity and (3) discursive resonance. Charting the variety of network constellations as studied in an international comparison of 20 transnational SI networks, a typology of SI ecosystems is constructed.

There is a need for innovative and cost-effective occupational safety approaches. The Finnish construction industry and its key stakeholders have introduced a new safety training concept, called the Safety Training Park (STP). The STP consists of full-scale training points that use new training methods to stimulate individual safe behaviour and to improve safety climate within workgroups and companies. The Safety Training Park in Northern Finland (STPNF) was designed, constructed, and financed through a collaborative process that included over 80 organizations. A realistic evaluation approach was applied to document the effectiveness of STPNF training from individual and organizational perspectives. Results indicate that the dialogical STP approach with several information sharing channels fits the target groups. Evidence regarding effectiveness at the organizational level is also discussed.

We argue that this form of citizen engagement could enable a better alignment of entrepreneurial initiatives with economic, social and community priorities, and to address issues of global significance of local interest in uncertain environments. To this end, we posit that engaging citizens in the entrepreneurial process could facilitate agency at the collective level of people with their rights, duties and responsibilities, to identify, participate in and govern with existing institutions, in meaningful economic and social activity in defined spatial environments. Our normative understanding of entrepreneurial process involves the creation of business, social and public enterprises, the formation of which is led by entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are of course citizens of specific nation states, but their endeavours do not necessarily warrant the participation of the wider community of citizens in the entrepreneurial process beyond their receiving function as users of goods and services. We consider whether pro-active engagement in a variety of ways, as nurtured in the practice of Citizen Science or Citizen Economics projects, could strengthen the profile and substance of entrepreneurship to resolve critical economic, social and environmental concerns of our times. We use the concept of the ‘commons’ and collective efficacy to argue for an understanding of entrepreneurship and innovation as a social good. We argue that Citizen Entrepreneurship (CE) is able to create new forms of collective organisation and governance, and derive economic and social value by addressing local issues arising from wide-spread phenomena such as climate change, ecological and environmental challenges, inequality, social polarisation, populism, migration and the gradual erosion of democratic institutions. To do so, citizens need to develop capabilities for engagement in the entrepreneurship process, especially when traditional public and market institutions fail to satisfy their existential needs. Indeed, active engagement could lead to the achievement of capabilities for well-being and fulfilling lives which go beyond the acquisition of skills and competencies necessary to pursue a vocation or a career. We refer to and interpret three examples of collective entrepreneurial activity in different urban environments in European countries as models of CE highlighting what we see as a growing trend in the entrepreneurial substance of the ‘urban commons’. We work towards the creation of a conceptual model with which to develop an understanding of a unique formulation of entrepreneurship. © 2020 SAGE Publications.","capabilities; citizen engagement; Citizen entrepreneurship; collective efficacy; social good; urban commons",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112168100

Consequently, crises provoke a profound impact on executives' sensemaking, as they attempt strategically navigate these events. We bridge thinking around crisis management with theories of strategic decision-making and conclude that strategic improvisation is a vital mechanism that enables effective management interventions to be executed as a means of surviving, adapting, or potentially thriving under challenging circumstances. We derive a theoretically grounded framework of five strategic imperatives underlying our 10C Strategic Imperative Framework for improvisation readiness. First, we develop the Improvisation Readiness Index Score (IRIS) as a means for executives to diagnose their organization's improvisation readiness according to the requisite strategic imperatives. Second, we present a three-step guide for executives to consider for managing through crisis with improvisation and the strategic imperatives at its heart. Third, we illustrate the strategy improvisation challenges. This allows executives to close the strategic improvisation gaps between their ‘actual’ and ‘preferred’ readiness. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","COVID-19; Crisis; Improvisation readiness; Resilience; Strategic implications; Strategic improvisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087912544

We theorize that team design thinking enables NPD teams to develop more innovative products––products that are useful and novel––by reducing the routine and cognition-based inertia that constrains the team’s innovativeness. Through a study of 247 NPD projects, we investigate the relationships between team design thinking, product utility, and product novelty. Further, we also explore whether the team’s unfamiliarity with product contexts influences these relationships. Findings show that team design thinking is positively associated with useful products in both familiar and unfamiliar contexts, but that team design thinking is associated with product novelty only in familiar contexts. Findings also suggest that team design thinking can be framed as a dynamic capability that addresses routine and cognition-based inertia by expanding the organization’s knowledge resource base, particularly in familiar contexts. A key implication of this research is that team design thinking will influence product utility in a variety of situations, but its influence on product novelty will be evident primarily in familiar contexts. © 2020 Product Development & Management Association",,"Product development; Cognition-based; Dynamic capabilities; Familiar contexts; Innovative product; Innovativeness; Knowledge resource; New product development; Product innovativeness; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086153889

Decision-makers in multinational enterprises have undertaken various types of actions to alleviate the impacts of the pandemic. In most cases these actions relate in some way to managing distance and to rethinking boundaries, whether at the macro- or firm-levels. Managing distance and rethinking boundaries have been the primary focus of much IB research since the IB field was established as a legitimate area of academic inquiry. The pandemic has led to increased cross-border distance problems (e.g., as the result of travel bans and reduced international mobility), and often also to new intra-firm distancing challenges imposed upon previously co-located employees. Prior IHRM research has highlighted the difficulties presented by distance, in terms of employee selection, training, support, health and safety, as well as leadership and virtual collaboration. Much of this thinking is applicable to solve pandemic-related distance challenges. The present, extreme cases of requisite physical distancing need not imply equivalent increases in psychological distance, and also offer firms some insight into the unanticipated benefits of a virtual workforce – a type of workforce that, quite possibly, will influence the ‘new normal’ of the post-COVID world. Extant IHRM research does offer actionable insight for today, but outstanding knowledge gaps remain. Looking ahead, we offer three domains for future IHRM research: managing under uncertainty, facilitating international and even global work, and redefining organizational performance. © 2020, Academy of International Business.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086049310

Based on a single-case qualitative study of a Brazilian subsidiary of a large biotechnology MNE (1989-2016), we found that: (1) the subsidiary's technological capability-building, from production-based to advanced levels (including R&D for applied research), reflects the effectiveness with which it implemented interactive learning strategies through the use of ‘science, technology and innovation’ (STI) and ‘doing, using and interacting’ (DUI) learning mechanisms to tap into three types of knowledge sources: within the subsidiary, the MNE corporate network, and other host sectoral system organisations; (2) the effectiveness of these strategies related to the combined and complementary use of various STI/DUI learning mechanisms over time, which supported the technological capability-building process and, ultimately, the implementation of innovation activities with increased value and novelty. By using a comprehensive and integrative approach to interactive learning, examining how such learning affects the subsidiary's accumulation of innovation capability ‘levels’ and adopting a micro-level perspective in a host emerging economy, we contribute to furthering the understanding of knowledge-seeking strategies and innovation in MNE-subsidiaries, from the standpoint of biotechnology.

The proposed design rules help marketing representatives assign leads more effectively to sales representatives, thereby fostering follow-up of marketing generated leads. In addition to our efforts to solve the sales lead black hole, we gain insights into how authentic marketing problems can be addressed through design research. By outlining a five-step procedure we illustrate how marketing scholars and practitioners jointly can address practical problems in a rigorous manner. The approach ensures that relevant research is conducted using state-of-the-art research methodologies. As such, the design science research approach is multi-method, multi-source, and multi-step in nature. Finally, by developing normative design rules we not only provide managers with prescriptive knowledge on what to do in certain problem situations, but also provide testable propositions that researchers can validate in other contexts.

The study finds that perceived CO is related to satisfaction with the relationship and with relationship performance in an inverted U-shaped form, while satisfaction is positively related to relationship performance. We show that, although preferring to receive CO from their supplier, customers might want a relationship that is not as intense/comprehensive as the one that the supplier aims to achieve.

It explores how accounting, in the form of a sales and operations planning (S&OP) forecast, helps discover the objections attached to the various enactments of an object multiple, namely a ‘demand chain’ - a lateral ordering of the firm's production and products from customers backward to suppliers - and translate these objections into decision mechanisms. The paper finds a process of accumulation of accountings that contributes to the enactment of the ‘demand chain’ multiple. In this process, accounting becomes both performative and provocative. As a source of performativity, accounting is relatively complete because it turns each emerging objection into a specific decision model, enacting the ‘demand chain’ in a certain way. As a force of provocation, accounting stimulates new objections to emerge against what accounting reveals about the ‘demand chain’; this adds new accountings onto existing ones, all of which exist simultaneously. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082769225

Previous studies argue that suppliers prefer conservative customers because of information asymmetry in production networks; we extend this line of research by focusing on trade credit during the 2007–2008 global financial crisis, a period that was characterized by a credit supply shock. We first document a positive association between conditional conservatism and firms’ access to trade credit both before and after the onset of the crisis, which indicates suppliers’ demand for conditional conservatism. Meanwhile, the association between conditional conservatism and trade credit experienced a significant decline following the onset of the crisis, and this only held when suppliers and customers had frequent transactions or were in close proximity, when transacted goods were standardized rather than differentiated, when customers were financially constrained and had high bargaining power, and when suppliers had sufficient liquidity. It implies that, when information asymmetry along the supply chain was low and customers had strong bargaining power, liquid suppliers increased their tolerance to less conservative customers, and they were even willing to grant trade credit to the less conservative customers that were financially constrained. Overall, this study adds to previous literature by demonstrating suppliers’ multifaceted demand for conditional conservatism. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Conditional conservatism; Financial crisis; Supply chain; Trade credit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082337179

Recent insights highlight the special role of tone from the top as a crucial driver of risk awareness. In this study, we take a systems perspective on control system design to investigate the role of tone from the top in creating risk awareness. In particular, we argue that both the interactive and the diagnostic use of budgets and performance measures interact with tone from the top in managing risk awareness. Our results show that interactive control strengthens the effect of tone from the top on risk awareness, whereas tone from the top and diagnostic control are empirically not interrelated with regard to creating risk awareness. To shed light on the boundary conditions of the proposed interdependencies, we further investigate whether the predicted interdependencies are sensitive to the level of perceived environmental uncertainty. We find that the effect of tone from the top and interactive control becomes significantly stronger in a situation of high perceived environmental uncertainty. Most interestingly, tone from the top and diagnostic control are complements with regard to risk awareness in settings of low perceived environmental uncertainty and substitutes at high levels of perceived environmental uncertainty. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Interactive and diagnostic use of budgets and performance measures; Perceived environmental uncertainty; Risk awareness; SMEs; Tone from the top",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082189563

Green innovation is an essential segment of gaining a competitive advantage in the sustainable supply chain to achieve sustainable development goals. However, boosting sustainable supply chain development through green innovation is a complex network activity in which a large number of partners are embedded, and the need exists to transfer or share knowledge in an equal and reasonable exchange process. This study proposes a novel framework to explore perceptions of fairness that include procedural and distributive approaches as antecedents. We also examine embeddedness, knowledge sharing, and green innovation in the sustainable supply chain in terms of equity theory and a network scenario. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG 9); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13). Useable sets of data were collected and used to test our theoretical hypotheses by surveying 225 firms in China's manufacturing supply chain sectors. The research model is analysed by the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology. The empirical findings reveal that perceived fairness constructs that consist of procedural and distributive fairness have a highly positive linkage with embeddedness, while those that do not present significant effects on knowledge sharing directly. Moreover, both embeddedness and knowledge sharing demonstrate significant partial mediating impact on green innovation in the sustainable supply chain; knowledge sharing especially plays a key role in achieving green innovation. This study finds that firm size as a control variable presents a positive effect on green innovation. Finally, conclusions and practical implications are given. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Embeddedness; Fairness perception; Green innovation; Knowledge sharing; Sustainable development goals (SDG's); Sustainable supply chain","Competition; Complex networks; Digital storage; Knowledge management; Least squares approximations; Planning; Supply chains; Competitive advantage; Embeddedness; Environmental issues; Green innovations; Knowledge-sharing; Partial least square (PLS); Structural equation modelling; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082165559

However, there has been little research to characterize the waste from buildings’ interior renovation (repair and maintenance) or decoration activities. The primary purpose of this study was to provide a systematic analysis for the generation and flows of decoration and renovation waste based on field investigation. Taking Shenzhen city - a fast-growing megacity (over 20 M population) in South China - as an example, the results show that approximately 1 Mt of decoration and renovation waste was generated in Shenzhen city in 2017, with an annual growth rate of 10% over the past decade. Concrete waste and brick (block) account for 72% of the total decoration and renovation waste. The landfilling rate of decoration and renovation waste has reached 83%, of which a majority was disposed of by open dumping. The renovation of older residential buildings produced more than half of the total decoration and renovation waste. Although the amount of hazardous materials such as gypsum and painting materials only account for a very low weight fraction of 2%, they could still pose significant environmental impacts, compared to other types of construction and demolition waste. Accelerating the construction of sorting facilities to separate toxic and valuable materials is crucial, to realize decoration and renovation waste minimization and lower environmental risks. Overall, the findings of this study could be applied to formulate environmentally sound management measures from a policy standpoint, for Shenzhen city. The methods could also be useful for decoration and renovation waste estimation and projection in other cities in China and beyond. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Generation; Interior decoration and renovation waste; Materials flow; Shenzhen city","Buildings; Conservation; Construction industry; Demolition; Maintenance; Population statistics; Toxic materials; Construction and demolition waste; Construction sectors; Environmentally sound management; Generation; Materials flow; Repair and maintenance; Residential building; Shenzhen city; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081675125

We analyze the reasons for discontinuation, and how this decision influence the environmental practices in the companies. This provides insights into the barriers for ISO14001, but also the institutionalized practices that continue in the companies, when the certification is discontinued, as well as the practices that have not become institutionalized and thus discontinue along with the certification. The companies have been certified an average of 8 years. There are two main categories of companies that have chosen to discontinue their ISO14001 certification: the first category cover those that have chosen to substitute with another system; their environmental practices mostly continue, although only one company have chosen to work with continuous improvements after they discontinued their certification. The second category cover those that have chosen to not to have a system. For those companies, very few practices from the systematic approach is maintained, even though they have many years of experience with being certified. Several of the companies still consider environmental issues when doing large investments such as new machinery or buildings. The main argument for discontinuing ISO14001 rests on a cost-benefit consideration; the resources needed to maintain the certification are too big compared to the experienced benefits. The lack of benefits is mainly related to economic arguments, but the companies also explain that there is no focus on ISO14001 from neither costumers nor other environmental stakeholders. Also, they have not found sufficient organizational and environmental benefits to sustain the system. The companies have focused on production and resource-efficiency and have not included more strategic elements such as a lifecycle or product-oriented perspective. Strategic initiatives can be a solution for the companies that feel that they have harvested the low hanging fruits already and have not found strategic value in ISO14001. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Discontinuation; Environmental management system; Environmental practice; ISO14001","Cost benefit analysis; Environmental management systems; Machinery; Continuous improvements; Discontinuation; Environmental benefits; Environmental issues; Environmental practices; Environmental stakeholders; ISO 14001; Resource efficiencies; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081655034

We compare the changes in accruals quality of firms restating between 2000 and 2014 with that of a control group. We do not find that firms improve accruals quality more than the control group following a restatement, even when we isolate the types of restatements considered to be most material.

This study empirically demonstrates the extent to which physical and social conditions may combine in a customer-centric grocery store to positively enhance customers' well-being and promote feelings of attachment to the establishment. Furthermore, this study reveals that customers' future behavioral intention are driven by the store's impact on their well-being and their desire to maintain ‘place attachment.’ From a managerial perspective, this work recommends that retail and consumer service organizations facing online competition focus on creating architectural and human resource conditions that promote consumer well-being and place attachment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Grocery stores; Place attachment; Servicescapes; Therapeutic landscapes; Transformative service research","commercial activity; competition (economics); health belief; marketing; retailing; service quality; service sector; supermarket",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079623399

However, few empirical studies have explored whether and how three core components of corporate market orientation (i.e., customer orientation, competitor orientation, and interfunctional coordination) affect environmental performance. Building on institutional theory and the absorptive capacity perspective, this study investigates the relationships among market orientation, knowledge creation, and environmental performance, as well as the moderating effects of environmental management system implementation. On the basis of survey data from 237 Chinese manufacturing firms, we used hierarchical multiple regression analyses to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that knowledge creation completely mediates the influence of competitor orientation on environmental performance and partially mediates the influence of customer orientation and interfunctional coordination on environmental performance.

In the proposed QF model, it is possible for the manufacturer to outsource production based on a reservation fee. The manufacturer's decision variable is in-house/outsource amount while the retailer decides on order quantity. Numerical experiments and sensitivity analyses have been implemented on the contract parameters.

But do these proactive behaviors have implications beyond working life? Inspired by the suggestion that individuals aim for a meaningful life we examine whether on days when individuals craft their jobs, they are more likely to craft non-work activities. It also seems likely that characteristics of the home environment moderate these cross-domain relationships. We suggest that crafting crosses domains particularly when individuals gain resources through high autonomy and high workload at home. We partly supported our model through a daily diary study, in which 139 service sector employees from six European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, UK) reported their experiences twice a day for five consecutive workdays. Home autonomy and home workload strengthened the positive relationship between seeking resources at work and at home. Moreover, home autonomy strengthened the positive association between seeking challenges at work and at home, and the negative relation between reducing demands at work and at home. These findings suggest that the beneficial implications of job crafting transcend life boundaries thereby providing advice for how individuals can experience greater meaning in their lives. © The Author(s) 2019.","compensation; diary study; home crafting; job crafting; spillover","adult; article; Belgium; clinical article; compensation; Denmark; employee; female; Germany; home environment; human; male; Netherlands; Spain; working time; workload",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066927449

When people are located at different areas and levels in the organisational hierarchy and they draw on different experiences and areas of knowledge, they often develop conflicting interpretations, which may compete for legitimacy. To capture the dimension of power in sensemaking, we combine the sensemaking perspective with a poststructuralist feminist conception of power, as this allows us to explore the mechanisms through which some sensemaking becomes legitimate whereas others remain marginalised. We specifically explore the ideological resources that shape the terrain within which a diverse workforce interpret, enact and emotionally experience diversity management in a local branch of a global retail chain store. The study used in-depth interviews and participant observations to provide insight into the complex mechanisms that are employed to control the definition of a specific situation, mapping out a hierarchical system of dominant, hidden and forbidden sensemaking of diversity management. The article concludes that the political processes of sensemaking deeply implicate emotions as a central force that facilitates the ongoing reproduction of social order. Our study, therefore, highlights the need to conceive of sensemaking, power and emotions as a complex nexus of the micro-political practices in which certain terrains of action unfold, allowing collective organising to occur. © The Author(s) 2019.","Diversity management; emotions; ideology; power; sensemaking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062463051

More recently, both theoretical and empirical work have begun to focus on situations in which performance management may facilitate internal organizational learning. In this study, we focus on one key component in performance management systems, namely generation of performance information. Based on a Bayesian learning model, we argue that generation of performance information at the individual level may create performance improvements because both users and frontline workers may learn where to prioritize their efforts. To test the isolated effect of this key component of any performance management system, we use as-good-As-random variation in exposure of students to testing because of a technical breakdown in an IT system. We identify the effect of testing on student learning measured two years after the breakdown. Results show positive and statistically significant effects of about 0.1 standard deviations, which is comparable to much more expensive interventions, and effects tend to persist after four years. We find larger effects for students with low socioeconomic status but also that schools with many students from this group are more reluctant to measure their performance.

The available literature on principals' PD deals with content and quality while mostly ignoring whether and how PD activities have an impact on leadership practices. In our study, we wanted to examine the extent to which principals perform learning-centred leadership practices and whether and how their practices are influenced by the PD programmes they have engaged in during the past twelve months. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 130 Turkish principals participated in the study. Using the SEM model, we examined the direct and indirect links between principals' PD and their self-perceived learning-centred leadership practices, with self-efficacy as the mediating variable. Findings: We found a positive, statistically significant yet weak relationship between principals' PD and their leadership practices, with self-efficacy playing a considerable mediating role. Originality/value: We argue that traditional types of PD activities can contribute to the leadership practices of principals, at least in countries where school principals are not adequately prepared for principalship positions. We suggest that such activities can contribute by providing newly appointed school principals with certain basic knowledge regarding effective leadership that many principals in developing countries are missing due to the lack of pre-service training. These activities can also strengthen principals' belief in their ability to overcome school problems and improve student learning. This, in turn, could motivate them to focus more on learning-centred leadership practices. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Learning-centred leadership; Principal preparation; Principal self-efficacy; Professional development; Turkey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085291388

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs design science principles. Data were collected using the Global Perspectives text corpus that describes the logistics systems of 20 countries from 2006–2014. The extracted texts were processed and analysed using text analytic techniques, and domain experts were employed for training and developing the approach. Findings: The developed approach is able to generate results in the form of logistics performance assessments. It contributes towards the development of more informed weights of the different country logistics performance categories. That said, a larger text corpus and iterative classifier training is required to produce a more robust approach for benchmarking and ranking. Practical implications: When successfully developed and implemented, the developed approach can be used by managers and government bodies, such as the World Bank and its stakeholders, to complement the Logistics Performance Index (LPI). Originality/value: A new and unconventional approach for logistics system performance assessment is explored.

The design comprised four products, representing non-ingestible/ingestible products and familiar/unfamiliar brands. These two aspects were seen as potentially moderating factors with respect to the impact of ecological claims. Findings: The results show that ecological product claims boosted beliefs that a product is indeed ecological. This influence was not moderated by non-ingestible/ingestible and familiar/unfamiliar product characteristics. Moreover, ecological product claims enhanced conceptually related product beliefs, namely, beliefs that the product is natural, environmentally friendly and healthy. Ecological claims also had a positive impact on the attitude toward the product. Practical implications: The results imply that influencers who want a receiver to believe that a product is ecological can expect to be successful by merely claiming that a product is ecological. Social implications: From a societal point of view, however, and in an era in which “alternative facts” and “post-truths” are becoming the subject of increasing concern, the results are problematic, because they underline that customers can be made to believe in claims even though no supporting evidence is provided.

Design/methodology/approach: Five longitudinal cases of captive R&D and manufacturing offshoring to emerging markets. Findings: The propositions entail the dual effect of operational subsidiary autonomy on primary knowledge transfer and reverse knowledge transfer. For newly established subsidiaries, operational subsidiary autonomy has a mainly negative effect on primary knowledge transfer and a mainly positive effect on reverse knowledge transfer and local collaboration activities increase this effect. Strategic subsidiary autonomy is mainly negative for primary and reverse knowledge transfer. Research limitations/implications: Limitations concerning the applied exploratory case study approach suggest that further research should test the identified relationships using surveys, after the initial pilot study. Practical implications: A gradual increase of operational subsidiary autonomy as the subsidiary capability level increases is beneficial to ensure primary knowledge transfer. Allowing subsidiaries to collaborate locally within the confines of their mandates benefits reverse knowledge transfer. Originality/value: This paper extends the secondary knowledge transfer concept to include knowledge flows with local collaboration partners, not only other subsidiaries and clarifies the distinction between operational and strategic autonomy concerning local collaboration. A subsidiary asserts operational autonomy when its collaboration with local partners relates to its existing mandate.

Learners also often struggle with advanced computing courses, perhaps from weakness with prerequisite concepts. One underlying challenge for researchers and instructors is determining the reason why a learner gets an advanced question wrong. Was the wrong answer because the learner lacked prerequisite skills, has not mastered the advanced skill, or some combination of the two? We contribute a design investigation into how to create differentiated questions which diagnose prerequisite and advanced skills at the same time. We focused on tracing and related skills as prerequisites, and on advanced object-oriented programming, concurrency, algorithm and data structures as the advanced skills. We conducted an inductive qualitative analysis of existing assessment questions from instructors and from a concept inventory with a validity argument (the Basic Data Structures Inventory). We found dependencies on a variety of prerequisite knowledge and mixed potential for diagnosing difficulties with prerequisites. Inspired by this analysis, we developed examples of differentiated assessments and reflected on design principles for creating/modifying assessments to better assess both advanced and prerequisite skills. Our example differentiated assessment questions and methods help enable research into how prerequisites skills affect learning of advanced concepts. They also may help instructors better understand and help learners with varying prerequisite knowledge, which may improve equity of learning outcomes. Our work also raises theoretical questions about what assessments really assess and how separate advanced topics and prerequisite skills are. © 2020 ACM.","advanced object-oriented programming; assessment; computer science education; concurrency; data structures and algorithms; differentiated assessment; prerequisite skills; tracing, educational design research","Concurrency control; Data structures; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Object oriented programming; Basic concepts; Computing course; Concept inventories; Design Principles; Learning outcome; Mixed potential; Qualitative analysis; Wrong answers; Curricula",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098714400

Because of a lack of empirical and evaluative studies on this form of branding, the current case study examines a volunteer resident ambassador program, which began as part of Aarhus, Denmark’s year as a European City of Culture in 2017, and has become permanent because of its success. Design/methodology/approach: The case study is based on official document analyses, participant observations of program activities, and interviews with volunteer program managers and volunteers who greet cruise ship tourists. Findings: Findings indicate that while the two managers and the volunteers all report on three volunteer roles – personal hosts, place promoters and providers of information – they prioritize and understand the roles differently. Similarly, the volunteers’ encounters with visitors are all unique, and this inevitably results in the conveyance of unruly and incidental destination images. Practical implications: This unruliness is not necessarily problematic: despite the wide-spread interest in the management of participative branding initiatives, it is seen to be the lack of explicit brand-centered management that fosters the program’s positive outcomes, including authentic and pleasant interactions between volunteers and tourists, which, in turn, result in positive attitudes amongst tourists toward their visit. Originality/value: This study discovers that positive participatory destination branding outcomes depend on managers respecting the ambassadors’ coveted autonomy, and letting go of control of a destination brand. Because of the growing hostility toward mass tourism in cities internationally, it is also noted that a resident ambassador program’s success is expected to depend on residents’ positive attitudes toward tourists. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand ambassadors; City branding; Co-branding; European city of culture; Participatory place branding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074820646

It seems that learners do not master the most basic concepts, or forget them between courses. If so, remedial practice could improve learning, but instructors rightly will not use scarce time for this without strong evidence. Based on personal observation, program tracing seems to be an important pre-requisite skill, but there is yet little research that provides evidence for this observation. To investigate this, our group will create theory-based assessments on how tracing knowledge affects learning of advanced topics, such as data structures, algorithms, and concurrency. This working group will identify relevant concepts in advanced courses, then conceptually analyze their pre-requisites and where an imagined student with some tracing difficulties would encounter barriers. The group will use this theory to create instructor-usable assessments for advanced topics that also identify issues caused by poor pre-requisite knowledge. These assessments may then be used at the start and end of advanced courses to evaluate to what extent students' difficulties with the advanced course originate from poor pre-requisite knowledge. © 2020 ACM.","computer science education; concurrency; data structures and algorithms; tracing","Computation theory; Concurrency control; Education computing; Engineering research; Group theory; Students; Basic concepts; Computing course; Pre-requisites; Working groups; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086434279

It also analyzes how middle managers interpret management control intentions and manage conflicting objectives, and how locally developed MCS are coupled with top management goals. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a case-study approach, based on interviews with top and middle managements, as well as document studies conducted at a medium-sized Danish municipality. Findings: Both constraining and enabling control systems empower middle managers and facilitate tight budget controls. Furthermore, middle managers play a crucial role in the use of MCS, develop local control systems, adjust existing control systems and influence the decisions and strategies of top management.

Practical implications: This paper shows how MCS, including budgeting and planning systems, can be applied in social services to help middle managements obtain tight budget controls while also improving service quality.

The paper discusses how “collaboration” on projects and in product development processes with colleagues/informants is a precondition for passing “tests,” which unfolded as subtle, verbalized demands made by colleagues/informants during fieldwork. Design/methodology/approach: Longitudinal anthropological fieldwork was carried out as part of an industrial PhD project, which investigates digitization as organizational, professional and social practices in the Danish construction industry. The fieldwork lasted on/off from April 2017 to December 2018. Various forms of participant observation and collaborative ethnographic methods were used during fieldwork. Findings: The paper investigates how these “tests” focused on two key aspects: the relevance of anthropology in a profit-oriented, technical corporate organization; and the application of anthropological theories and ethnographic methodologies for the benefit of product development, usability studies and organizational change. It is argued that the tests were passed through collaborative engagements, where the author oscillated between positions as collegial insider and outside researcher for the dual benefit of both commercial interests and research interests. Originality/value: The paper suggests that daring to collaborate and co-create products (as something different than texts) during organizational fieldwork for the benefit of both corporate and ethnographic interests offers strong possibilities for keeping ethnography relevant and applicable, passing tests in organizational settings and advancing ethnography’s impact in the world. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Applied research; Collaborative ethnography; Informants as colleagues; Organizational anthropology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079160217

This paper seeks to address this gap, by identifying factors that affect the financial performance of circular economy initiatives. The research uses a multiple embedded case study approach within a large Danish OEM, who has established four forms of take-back projects, in three different countries. The paper identifies seven factors which across the four cases affect the financial performance, through either affecting the efficiency of the take-back (i.e. the cost spent) or affecting the effectiveness of the take-back (i.e. the cost saved/turnover created) or even affecting both. In addition to the factors, the research identifies and discusses critical interdependencies between them, meaning that one factor might affect another factor positively or negatively. The paper provides novel insights towards the factors that from a financial standpoint should be considered when designing a take-back program, the research here seeks to improve the financial viability of circular economy, thus making it a viable option even for SMEs and companies faced with stark competition. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Circular economy; Financial performance; Resource effectiveness; Reverse logistics; Takeback program","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Circular economy; Financial performance; Resource effectiveness; Reverse logistics; Take backs; Finance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081647577

Findings: The study shows that while premium private labels (PPLs) are on par with national brands, discounter's PPLs outperform mainstream retailer's PPLs. Furthermore, consumers appear to purchase standard private labels and PPLs for themselves when shopping at a discounter but turn to national brands when shopping for socially risky situations.

This is something this study did not control for. Practical implications: Given that Lidl has opened its first US store in 2017 with ambitious expansion plans, our findings provide in particular practical guidelines for how to promote PPLs in countries where the discounter landscape is less saturated than in Germany.

Understand how futures and options contracts in commodities can be used to hedge price risk on long and short positions in the underlying products. Understand how option contracts add value by hedging risk in those contexts where the counterparty has optionality. Discuss the implications of Fair Trade for commodity traders and producers. Case overview/synopsis: In the case, Hernan Arosamena, CFO of The Specialty Coffee Trading Co. (TSCT), faces the challenge of designing an effective strategy to hedge the price risk caused by the increasing demand of the so-called Fair Trade coffee. Hernan Arosamena decides to review how the company has typically managed the price risk in its business transactions using future contracts to then incorporate the additional elements that trading Fair Trade coffee may entail. The typical price risk hedging strategy involves the use of coffee future contracts in long and short positions to ensure that the company obtains the desired margin in its coffee trading negotiations. To hedge the exposure to the risk of fluctuations in the price of coffee when the company sells Fair Trade coffee requires the additional use of put options.

Focusing on bike sharing system, the study also investigates the conflict-handling strategy of bike sharing companies and government regulation. Design/methodology/approach: An evolutionary game model is introduced to illustrate the interactive conflict between bike sharing companies and government regulation, combined with system dynamics (SD) to simulate the evolutionary conflict-handling strategies between the two players. Findings: The dynamic strategies of the two players are observed, and under five conditions the conflict outcomes are evolutionary stable states. Simulations show that each party sacrifices part of its interest and adjust its strategy according to that of the other, indicating the conflict-handling strategy as a compromising mode. Furthermore, the strategies of bike sharing companies are sensitive to additional operation and maintenance costs for producing low-quality bicycles and costs of positive regulation, which provides theoretical guidance for regulatory authorities. Originality/value: The station-less bike sharing come up in China recently, and it is an important research field of entrepreneurship. Owing to the uniqueness and novelty of the phenomenon, conflicts and challenges exist during the regulation process. Thus, the study practically contributes to the conflict-handling strategies of businesses and government under the context of sharing economy. Methodologically, as a novel issue with less available data to carry out empirical research, this study combines evolutionary game theory with SD to shed light on the complex interactions between businesses and government.

These approaches have been struggling to capture the increasingly complex risks originating from communities–both those who are directly affected by mining activities and the ones who have a vested interest in mining. The article defines two types of community relations which mining companies manage: communities of place (CofP), who live near the mine and are directly affected by its operations, and communities of interest (CofI), who are outside interest groups either opposing or supporting a given project. Community risks arise when CofPs create meaning about the legitimacy of the changes introduced into their physical and social environment, leading them to take action that affects the MNEs’ risk exposure to political, cultural or financial risks. The CofP can present these types of risks by acting alone or in cooperation with the CofI, who often have the resources and knowhow to affect corporate decision-making. The article contributes by defining community risk as an increasingly salient source of uncertainty for mining companies and MNEs in particular. Conceptualising community risk as the lack of legitimacy with these important stakeholder groups enables MNEs to strategise and adopt practices which are adapted to the local context. At the same time it assures investors, political and cultural stakeholders that the communities who have a specific interest in the project accept its impact. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","armenia; community engagement; legitimacy; mining; Risk management","Decision making; Mining; Public relations; Technology transfer; Alternative framework; Armenia; Communities of interest; Community engagement; Community relations; legitimacy; Multinational enterprise; Stakeholder groups; Risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067687174

In practice, useful formulations also include various costs and constraints that regularize the problem and reduce the risk due to estimation errors, resulting in solutions that depend on a number of hyperparameters. As the number of hyperparameters grows, selecting their value becomes increasingly important and difficult. In this article, the authors propose a systematic approach to hyperparameter optimization by leveraging recent advances in automated machine learning and multiobjective optimization. They optimize hyperparameters on a train set to yield the best result subject to market-determined realized costs. In applications to single- and multiperiod portfolio selection, they show that sequential hyperparameter optimization finds solutions with better risk-return trade-offs than manual, grid, and random search over hyperparameters using fewer function evaluations. At the same time, the solutions found are more stable from in-sample training to out-of-sample testing, suggesting they are less likely to be extremities that randomly happened to yield good performance in training. © 2020, With intelligence.

The authors propose a greedy online classifier that contemporaneously determines which hidden state a new observation belongs to without the need to parse historical observations and without compromising persistence. Their classifier is based on the idea of clustering temporal features while explicitly penalizing jumps between states by a fixed-cost regularization term that can be calibrated to achieve a desired level of persistence. Through a series of return simulations, the authors show that in most settings their new classifier remarkably obtains a higher accuracy than the correctly specified maximum likelihood estimator. They illustrate that the new classifier is more robust to misspecification and yields state sequences that are significantly more persistent both in and out of sample.

Baggage handling infrastructure is, however, both costly and extremely space-consuming; hence, it is necessary to use the resources optimally. In this paper, we present strategies for optimising baggage processes in airports for outbound and inbound baggage. Outbound baggage is defined as baggage checked-in locally at curbside, transported to the airside by the baggage handling system (BHS), where it is sorted to a chute (lateral). Based on a case study, the authors introduce the idea of shifting the assignment strategy of chutes from a conventional build to a more handler-friendly compressed build. This is achieved without extending the baggage infrastructure, but by using advanced optimisation methods to allocate chute(s). Inbound baggage is baggage terminating in the airport after being reclaimed by the passenger. For inbound baggage, the process is different and based on batches.

This paper makes use of a systematic literature review to identify non-cryptocurrency use cases of blockchain to establish an overview of existing or hypothesized solutions using the technology. The identified use cases are subsequently assessed on their technology readiness level (TRL) using the guidance of established research [1] to determine the maturity of individual blockchain solutions described in peer-reviewed literature. By categorizing the individual use cases into groups, a generalized assessment of maturity for different application areas is assessed for blockchain technology. The literature review and subsequent estimation of TRL revealed that there are highly mature blockchain use cases, although they are quite limited in terms of industry-wide utility. As an example, the Everledger use case has tracked over two million diamonds and is estimated to be TRL 9 (the highest level) in the specific scope of diamond provenance tracking, but other luxury-tracking blockchain initiatives are years behind this [2]. © 2020 IEEE.","blockchain; literature review; technology readiness level (TRL); use cases","Cryptocurrency; Application area; Literature reviews; Systematic literature review; Technology readiness levels; Blockchain",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089201127

The fictions this article dispels are that low-risk investing (1) delivers weaker returns than other common factor premiums, (2) is mostly about betting on bond-like industries, (3) is especially sensitive to transaction costs and only works among small-cap stocks, and (4) has become so expensive that it cannot do well going forward.

I highlight this interpretive role by comparing Galambos and Amatori's construct to Joseph Schumpeter's gale of creative destruction and Arthur Cole's entrepreneurial stream as metaphors that attempt to explain the relationship between entrepreneurship and historical change. I also point out the risks that taken-for-granted metaphors can have in narrowing room for interpretation, and argue that reflexivity and playfulness are essential to keeping conceptual metaphors alive as interpretive devices.

However, there is almost no systematic research into the meaning of intuition for negotiation. In this conceptual paper, drawing on five interviews of experienced negotiators, we apply general research on intuition to the specific case of negotiation and find that negotiators use intuition specifically for attribution and social interaction.

Design is complicit in the problems we are facing, and informs and shapes how people live. In this article, I seed ideas about design research education for global challenges. I speak to the merits of post-disciplinary and hybrid strategies, and look to science for clues about how to respond to twenty-first-century challenges through design. I posit sustainability brokering as a new pathway for design, and anticipating alternative futures as a critical step in developing transformative innovation. I then propose participatory research through design as a foundational methodology; describe four pillars of practice to scaffold sophisticated research at undergraduate and master's level; and lay out a work plan for building research capacity in a doctoral school.

These technologies began as instrumental aids to support office work of individuals but have since also become the basis for social interactions and community building in organisations and more recently become able to perform managerial roles with the use of advanced AI capabilities. Our call for papers to this special issue invited original studies to go further and advance our thinking on the strategic implications of this layered evolution of workplace technologies on work and the structure of organisations. In this introduction, we synthesise the main themes from the special issue, and also ongoing dialogues with the growing community at the regular AIS / IFIP 9.1 workshop on the Changing Nature of Work. A key observation is that the work involved in configuring emergent Digital/Human configurations, is vastly under-reported and poorly understood. Paradoxically, this configuring work is the most demanding and critical in the shaping of modern organisations. We suggest that this type of largely invisible work requires engagement beyond the level of execution or even the meaning of work, it requires intervening with third order effects that get to the core of what an organisation is. We highlight the challenges for organisations in dealing with third order change, particularly because these effects are beyond existing frames of reference and require more dynamic and supple responses based on the values, purpose and intent dominant in the organisation – we describe this as structural digital work. Leaders that are unable or unwilling to engage with effects at this level, and this type of work, will miss identifying core opportunities and risks associated with digital transformation in organisations. We also reflect on the value of current theories and methods used to research this important and emergent phenomenon. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Changing nature of work; Digital transformation; Digital work; Digital/Human configurations; New ways of working; Organisational transformation","Information systems; Management information systems; Community buildings; Current theories; Digital transformation; Emergent phenomenon; Frames of reference; Organisational transformations; Social interactions; Third-order effects; Automatic identification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087155285

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has caused severe disruptions across the world and in many supply chains, particularly in the healthcare supply chain. Therefore, this paper, for the first time, develops a practical decision support system based on physicians' knowledge and fuzzy inference system (FIS) in order to help with the demand management in the healthcare supply chain, to reduce stress in the community, to break down the COVID-19 propagation chain, and, generally, to mitigate the epidemic outbreaks for healthcare supply chain disruptions. This approach first divides community residents into four groups based on the risk level of their immune system (namely, very sensitive, sensitive, slightly sensitive, and normal) and by two indicators of age and pre-existing diseases (such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure). Then, these individuals are classified and are required to observe the regulations of their class.

People analytics are said to allow decision-makers to make evidence-based, bias-free, and objective decisions, and expand workers' opportunities for personal and professional growth. Drawing on a virtue ethics approach, we argue that the use of people analytics in organizations can create a vicious cycle of ethical challenges - algorithmic opacity, datafication, and nudging - which limit people's ability to cultivate their virtue and flourish. We propose that organizations can mitigate these challenges and help workers develop their virtue by reframing people analytics as a fallible companion technology, introducing new organizational roles and practices, and adopting alternative technology design principles. We discuss the implications of this approach for organizations and for the design of people analytics, and propose directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algorithmic management; People analytics; Virtue ethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083322350

The interplay between profit convexity and market growth impacts whether a high-quality or a low-quality firm is the first mover. We relate the first-mover advantage to patents; we find that patents expedite investments and increase the incentives for high-quality firms to become first movers. Furthermore, even with a persistent first-mover advantage we show that first-mover advantages in terms of firm value are either over- or underestimated.

This study aims at clarifying how different actors employ parameters of sustainability in building design and what enables the holistic perspective of the interrelating social, economic and environmental parameters. Interviews with building developers and designers show that decision support tools are used late in the design process and commonly focused on single parameters of sustainability. The analysis shows how practitioners of the planning and early design phases operate at general levels of geometrical clusters and volumes but must continuously evaluate each project from the perspective of the specifications of end-users and the public, to ensure holistic sustainability. This opposing relationship between need and availability of general and specific data, however, challenges the implementation of holistic sustainability. Advancing the interdisciplinary, holistic building design requires systematic aggregation of data from executed projects of this data into applicable rules-of-thumb. In parallel, future tools for simulation and dialogue must employ a broader scope of sustainability parameters. The conceptual frameworks of data and tools presented in this study can be used as a backdrop for developing sectoral initiatives to enable holistic decisions in the early stages of sustainable building design. © 2020 by the author(s).","Building design stages; Data and knowledge management; Decision support tools; Holistic sustainability; Sustainability parameters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082695793

In its original formulation, the concept of hegemony had two defining features: firstly, it was conceived of as a society-wide, macroscopic formation and second as self-reinforcing i.e. self-replicating. This article argues that the rise of big-data in public relations is a hegemonic development that further re-enforces the current institutional logics and power in the three main spheres of society: corporate, governance and civic. Using the economic notion of externalities, the authors argue that loss of agency over personal data is the unpriced, unrecognized externality that drives the big-data market. This externality is dependent on those who are the losers of agency not having the requisite information, power or resources to negotiate alternatives that might re-dress the balance. As users and proponents of the use of big data, the public relations profession has a number of key questions to answer if it is not to re-inforce arguments that it is a hegemonizing force in organizations and society. Normal economic remedies to address externalities are not adequate to a case that is both ethical as well as economic in nature. The article therefore concludes with five arguments that the public relations profession should debate to provide leadership within organisations and society. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Ethics; Externalities; Hegemony",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081927257

Focusing on synergy realization in CBAs and applying a process and conditional perspective, we propose the relationship between national/ organizational culture differences and synergy realization to be moderated by the quality and extent of due diligence and post-acquisition coordination. Drawing from cross-cultural interaction and inter-organizational learning arguments, we further propose idiosyncratic effects of cultural differences in different synergy realization contexts, where we contrast explicit with implicit synergy realization. Our analysis is based on a unique survey on a sample of 103 cross-border acquisitions. The results indicate that both national and organizational culture differences exert a negative impact on the realization of implicit synergies while no impact on the realization of explicit synergies. National culture differences are found to have a stronger negative effect than organizational culture differences on synergy realization. Sufficient culture and human due diligence prior to the acquisition is found to significantly moderate the impact of high cultural differences. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acquisition process; Cross-border acquisitions; Inter-organizational learning; National culture differences; Organizational culture differences; Synergy realization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081909280

Synthesizing insights from current Neuroscience, from twentieth century American Pragmatism and from nineteenth century French Aristotelianism, this emergent intellectual tradition proposes a dynamic account of habit’s embodiment which we will first describe and then advocate. Two recurring suggestions within this habit renaissance are of particular relevance to Business Ethicists: firstly, that there is a ‘plastic’ structure pertaining to habit and, secondly, that there is a processual ‘double-law of habituation’. Taken together, these accounts of habit and habituation provide virtue ethicists with a basis for claiming analytic and pragmatic authority within applied ethics debates in general and within Business Ethics debates in particular. We develop this argument in three steps. Firstly, we elaborate upon why habits are said to be plastic and why the process of habituation is said to be characterised by a double-law.

We propose that government initiatives fostering entrepreneurship should allow entrepreneurial firms to access more bank credit by reducing the risk incurred by lenders. We simultaneously estimate the probability of obtaining credit when a firm applies for a loan and the probability that the firm has been discouraged when it does not apply for a loan. In both cases we control for endogeneity. Our results are based on 18,872 observations (from the European Central Bank (ECB) SAFE dataset and Global Entrepreneurship Monitor – GEM) and show that government initiatives improve the probability of entrepreneurial firms obtaining bank credit but do not affect the probability of being discouraged from borrowing. The results also suggest that government initiatives fostering entrepreneurship are of most benefit to younger, smaller, high-growth, and more innovative firms that operate in contexts where the demand for, and accordingly the competition for, bank credit is strongest. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Credit access; Discouraged borrowers; Entrepreneurship; Government initiative; Small and medium firms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081202233

However, the potential of multi-trophic-level production systems, such as the co-culture of vegetables, flowers and aquatic animals, has received little attention. We performed a two-year experiment comparing multispecies (cauliflower, taro, flowers and aquatic animals) co-culture, and mono-cauliflower farming practices on the Chongming Eco-island of China. The abundance of herbivorous insects and their predators, pesticide input and cauliflower yield were recorded. The results indicated that multispecies co-culture decreased the abundance of insect herbivores by 19.9–26.0% and thus decreased pesticide use by 22.2–30.0%. Meanwhile, we found that co-culture of crops, flowers and aquatic animals increased the abundance (29.5–34.1%), and species diversity of invertebrate predators (3.3–3.8%), and increased cauliflower yield (6.9–7.5%). There were significant positive relationships between the abundance, species richness (or diversity) of arthropod predators and cauliflower yield.

Existing tooling solutions offer certain limitations in the molding process such as clogging of channels, low open-area fraction, low fatigue life, and longer cycle times. With the utilization of additive manufacturing techniques, the tooling can not only be made more economical and produced in shorter time duration but also more efficient.

Design of micro-features and their fabrication is carried out using UV light mask projection method. A characterization approach for precision manufacturing of micro-features using X-ray Computed Tomography is also discussed.

Societal grand challenges require joint efforts by private, public, and social sector organizations and are described in the framework of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One major contributor to this framework are social entrepreneurial ventures. Aligning their interventions and indicators with the SDGs can provide them with great benefits such as facilitating resource mobilization and increasing legitimacy among stakeholders. The majority of research on SDGs tends to understand the SDG framework as inherently good, as a powerful compass and narrative to create social value and take action. However, taking-for-granted that social entrepreneurial ventures readily materialize the SDGs seems to neglect the question of whether they accept the framework and how an utilization may differ among them. Drawing on qualitative interviews of 15 social entrepreneurial ventures, we address this gap and identify three distinct types of SDG utilization, namely SDG evangelism, SDG opportunism, and SDG denial. Our study contributes to research on the intersection of social entrepreneurship and societal grand challenges by uncovering the roles of resourcefulness and deviance in SDG utilization. Furthermore, we identify trust between the United Nations and social entrepreneurial ventures as a determinat for SDG utilization and provide several practical implications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Social entrepreneurial ventures; Societal grand challenges; Sustainable Development Goals; Utilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079868068

However, the design of value propositions of circular product-service system is not widely investigated and understood in literature, leading to the lack of guidance for the incorporation of circularity into product-service system design. This study presents a systematic analysis of 46 approaches that can support the design of circular and/or product-service system value propositions in the context of business model innovation. The research methodology is based on a three-step systematic literature review, followed by a critical analysis grounded on content analysis procedures. The 46 approaches identified were classified according to their theoretical and practical characteristics (development level, nature of data, representation style, process type, actors’ perspective, and purpose). The results point to a heterogeneity of approaches, although most are focused on the development of business models in a broader scope, with no clear boundaries on value proposition design. A critical analysis is presented in relation to the interface of the design scope of value propositions oriented to circular economy and product-service system. The paper proposes guiding principles that can support effective development of value propositions of circular product-service system at the early stages of the business modeling. A research agenda is outlined and indicates key trends oriented towards the development of an integrated and systemic approach based on a multiple stakeholder perspective, definition of design options of value propositions of circular product-service system, exploitation of perceived value, and more quantitative and empirical studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Business model innovation; Circular economy; Circular product-service system; Product-service system; Value proposition design","Systems engineering; Business model innovation; Circular economy; Multiple stakeholders; Product-service systems; Productservice system (PSS); Research methodologies; Systematic literature review; Value proposition; Product design",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079348261

Building on the legitimacy-as-process perspective, I argue that companies construct the legitimacy of their involvement by engaging in relational work, that is, by investing efforts in shaping their relations with others and thereby redefining roles and responsibilities. To explore the role of relational work in business-driven social change, I present an inductive, interpretive study of a pharmaceutical company’s efforts to build a market for its products by improving diabetes care in Indonesia. Grounded in the empirical study, I develop a process model to explain how legitimacy is redefined from the bottom-up, that is, how a company’s involvement is re-negotiated in situ and crafted to attain the social approval of a wider audience. Advancing the micro-foundations of nonmarket strategy, the model offers new insights into how companies can organize with nonmarket actors and how they can effectively publicize their involvement as socially responsible. I also discuss the model’s implications for a more critical research agenda on the political responsibilities of companies in social change. © 2020 Society for the Advancement of Management Studies and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","business in society; legitimacy; nonmarket strategy; relational strategies; social change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077875291

It addresses the deliberate avoidance of (over)spending during holidays and states that this behaviour may be just as conspicuous and provide social signals that are just as strong as those connected to the consumption of expensive luxury goods. The conceptual development is based on a combination of the two dichotomies of ‘consumption versus non-consumption’ and ‘conspicuous versus inconspicuous’, resulting in four conceptually distinctive categories of behaviour: conspicuous consumption, conspicuous non-consumption, inconspicuous non-consumption and conspicuous non-consumption. The latter, conspicuous non-consumption, is of special interest in this article, exemplified through personal vignettes. Explorative readings of travel blogs lead to the identification of five themes that characterize conspicuous non-consumption in tourism: ‘identity building’, ‘recycling, upcycling and repurposing’, ‘spiritualizing’, ‘retreating and detoxing’ and ‘slowing down’. Usually, tourism innovation policies are characterized by a ritual growth compulsion, and do not celebrate non-consumption, which is found to be synonymous with non-innovation. This is a paradox for the timely modernizing of tourist services and destinations. Increasingly, there is a need to reorient innovation and to give consideration to how the innovation of ‘nothing’ can also undergo a distinctive progression and even contribute positively to tourism economies. This article highlights the entry points for innovation at the tourism business and destination levels. © The Author(s) 2019.","conceptual model; conspicuousness; innovation; innovation orientation; non-consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077146047

The contributions of the study relate to the development of SBMs in service, where the value processes happen simultaneously and where the element value perception has to be added to the extant SBM literature, which is closely related to the creation and delivery of physical goods as in product-oriented industries. The study also contributes through the dual perspective (providers and customers) on sustainable value proposition, value creation and value capture. The findings reveal different key aspects in creating and capturing sustainable value through SBMs and sustainable service innovation. The managerial implications for creating and implementing SBM in service stress the need for employee engagement, customer involvement and targeted and personal communication educating internal and external sustainability ambassadors. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075432644

Results from regression analyses based on a sample of 531 business expatriates in East Asia confirm our proposed moderated mediation model. Thus, findings indicate that angry temperament inhibits the beneficial effects of proactive personality on time to proficiency. Moreover, results suggest that time to proficiency functions as a mediator in the relationship between proactive personality and performance.

We interrogate this tension in an ethnographic study of engineering work, where we found that in response to management control the engineering communities engaged in constructive disobedience – that is, subversion and displacement of rules and orders to construct a dynamic of control where work can be executed autonomously. By associating constructive disobedience with control in CoPs, our study contributes with insight into and theorization of how management control is dealt with and how control operates in work characterized by CoPs. The study also provides deepened insight into the limits of management control and how professionalism may be maintained despite increased management.

The approach is based on managers identifying and managing tensions between the three priorities, by employing one of the three strategic responses. Although recent work has provided a theoretical basis for such tension acknowledgment and management, there is a dearth of empirical studies. We interviewed 32 corporate sustainability managers across 25 forestry and wood-products organizations in Australia. Study participants were divided into two groups: (1) those considered effective at corporate sustainability and (2) a status-quo group. Contrary to current theory, our findings showed that acknowledgment of organizational tensions was widespread in the Australian forestry and wood-products industry and not limited to those managers who are effective at managing corporate sustainability. What differed was the degree to which managers did something about the perceived tensions—with the effective group more consistently acting to manage and resolve paradoxical scenarios. Our findings suggest that existing theoretical constructs of tension management may not adequately capture the individual-level complexity involved with managing tensions in practice. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Corporate sustainability; Integrative view; Paradox; Resolution; Separation strategy; Synthesis strategy; Tension management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057825663

This new construct, referred as a “development asset value index” (DAVI), is a value index for newly developed properties (only) in a given geographical property market. It tracks longitudinal changes in the highest and best use (HBU) value of locations, and it reveals developer and landowner behavior taking advantage of the optionality inherent in land ownership. In particular, the DAVI reflects developers' use of flexibility in the exercise of the call option to (re)develop the property to any legal use and density. We empirically estimate a DAVI for commercial property (i.e., central locations) and compare it with a corresponding traditional transaction-price-based property asset price index (PAPI) corrected for depreciation. We believe that the difference primarily reflects the realized value of flexibility in land development. We find that the DAVIs display greater value growth and are smoother over time and less cyclical than their corresponding PAPIs for the same locations. This suggests that developers successfully use flexibility, and that development may be riskier than stabilized property investment due primarily only to leverage effects (construction costs).

While mobile payment is already the dominant payment type in Asia, it is still in its infancy in Europe despite a high mobile phone penetration rate and service providers' considerable investments in the technology. Mobile payment is therefore a recent example of the puzzle of abundance—a phenomenon describing a situation in which the potential of a new disruptive technology is not tapped by the masses even though it offers substantial benefits to them. In this study, we address this puzzle by investigating the factors influencing the intention to use a disruptive technology. We draw on the example of mobile payment and develop and test a refined technology acceptance model. Results indicate that the intention to use mobile payment services is positively affected by perceived usefulness, perceived compatibility, perceived personal innovativeness, and perceived social influence, but is negatively affected by perceived risk. Both perceived costs and perceived risk mitigate the positive impact of several other characteristics.

However, potentially disruptive technologies often struggle to significantly influence practice. One prominent example is additive manufacturing (AM). Although AM is often regarded as the next great technological revolution in waiting, it has not yet established itself on a large scale in many fields of application. We investigate the reasons behind those challenges by looking at the various fields in which AM is applied and relating them to the specific challenges AM faces, as well as the opportunities it offers in those fields. Our findings rely on a multi-perspective technology foresight process that is based on a discourse analytic approach and that comprises data tomography covering the biggest German-language online magazine on AM and qualitative interview data collected from a range of AM stakeholders. The findings provide an empirically well-founded evaluation and explanation of the link between the challenges and opportunities offered by AM and the extent to which this disruptive technology is leveraged in specific fields.

One direction of simply following the American mainstream on academic rigor demonstrates a lack of self-confidence, limiting theoretical innovation and practical relevance. Yet going in the other direction of overly indigenous research reflects over-confidence, often isolating the Chinese management research from the mainstream academia and at times, even becoming anti-science. A more integrated approach of conducting Chinese management research is recommended. Specifically, it is recommended that researchers can focus on phenomena salient in China and follow rigorous scientific methods, as illustrated by a few exemplary studies using the Chinese context.

In turn, this situation is leading to the decline of certain mainstream business formats and, simultaneously, the emergence of others. Based on a review of recent crisis recovery processes, the tourism sector is likely to rebound from this sudden market shock, primarily because of various forms of government interventions. Nevertheless, although policymakers seek to strengthen the resilience of post-pandemic tourism, their subsidies and other initiatives serve to maintain a fundamentally flawed market logic. The crisis has, therefore, brought us to a fork in the road–giving us the perfect opportunity to select a new direction and move forward by adopting a more sustainable path. Specifically, COVID-19 offers public, private, and academic actors a unique opportunity to design and consolidate the transition towards a greener and more balanced tourism.

Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the asymmetric effects of hotel attributes on customer satisfaction by extracting 412,784 consumer-generated reviews from TripAdvisor across different cities in China. Findings: By taking into account the origins of customers and hotel star ratings, the study uncovers that guests’ expectations of hotel performance differ with respect to their origins (domestic and international guests) and the star ratings of the hotels being reviewed, thereby moderating the asymmetric impact of hotel attributes on customer satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: The study compares and contrasts the determinants of customer satisfaction for domestic and international guests in the context of Chinese hotels. Care should still be exercised when generalizing the insights gleaned from this study to other contexts. Practical implications: The findings from this study translate into actionable guidelines for hotel operators to make informed decisions regarding service improvement.

Design/methodology/approach: A systems theory perspective debunks this divide as a false distinction that cannot do justice to the conceptual complexity of the field of corporate social responsibility (CSR) scholarship. Findings: Drawing on the systems-theoretic ideas of Niklas Luhmann and the “Laws of Form” by George Spencer Brown, the paper shows that the divide may be dissected into a four-cell matrix constituted by two other distinctions-descriptive vs prescriptive and categorical vs hypothetical-the latter of which was seminally suggested by Donaldson and Preston (1995). Practical implications: The emerging four-cell matrix is shown to centrally embrace the multiplicity of normative, empirical and instrumental approaches to CSR. This multiplicity is exemplified by the application of these approaches to the phenomenon of CSR communication. Social implications: A more general implication of the proposed argument for the field of business ethics is in tracing the phenomena of moral diversity and moral ambivalence back to the regime of functional differentiation as the distinguishing feature of the modern society. This argument drives home the point that economic operations are as ethical or unethical as political operations, and that both economic and political perspectives on ethical issues are as important or unimportant as are religious, artistic, educational or scientific perspectives. Originality/value: In contrast to the empirical-normative divide, the perspective is shown to centrally embrace the multiplicity of normative, empirical and instrumental approaches to CSR. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Matrix; Pragmatism; Separation thesis; Social systems theory; Tetralemma",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078276393

This concern presents new challenges for companies and impels them to incorporate environmental sustainability into their business strategies. However, smaller companies, such as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), have often been prevented from considering environmentally friendly investments beyond those legally required because these firms lack a holistic perspective on sustainability. They also have a limited perception of the interdependence of corporate, economic, and environmental business components. The long-term survival of SMEs could be significantly strengthened by a holistic understanding based on integrated methods that facilitate the identification and representation of determinants of environmental conduct. These methods would further help to enhance these companies’ competitive advantages. This study sought to use fuzzy cognitive mapping techniques and the system dynamics (SD) approach to carry out analyses of determinants of environmental conduct in SMEs. The results show that this dual methodology enriches the decision-making process as it enables SME managers and decision makers to anticipate and analyze the consequences of their environmental conduct decisions. The results were validated by both the department head and a board member of Portugal's Regional Proximity and Licensing Department of the Institute for the Support of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Innovation (IAPMEI in Portuguese).

Anaerobic digestion (AD) has long been introduced as an environmental-friendly and sustainable waste management technology with bio-methane as final product. Energy production via AD of HW would significantly contribute to low-carbon energy production systems and circular bio-economy. In this study, optimal conditions, inhibiting factors, and microbial community changes in continuously fed biogas reactors during anaerobic digestion of HW at elevated influent feedstock concentration (IFC) were investigated. The highest methane yield (327 ± 21 mL g VS−1) was obtained at IFC of 3% TS. Increased IFC deteriorated the process and affected the microbiome dynamicity. Specifically, methane production was reduced by 50% with a concomitant increment of ammonia, Na+, and K+ concentration. Two archaeal species (Methanosaeta and WSA2) were dominating the microbial community at stable period. Two uncharacterized microbial groups (WWE1 and WSA2) were present and a potential syntrophic interaction between these two members was hypothesized to play a crucial role in achieving a well-performing process. AD process treating HW showed promising results for valorization of HW to clean energy-biomethane both in environmental and economic aspects. Specifically, 1 t of HW VS could obtain a greenhouse gases (GHG) mitigation of −54 to −272 kg CO2,eq via the AD process. The LCA results demonstrated that such a bioenergy system would also bring about environmental savings in ecosystem quality and resource damage categories. Although ammonia inhibition at elevated IFC found as a potential inhibitory factor, it can be easily overcome using co-digestion strategies or nitrogen recovery at upstream. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Environmental footprint; Human waste; Influent feedstock concentration; Methane; Microbial community","Ammonia; Carbon; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Health risks; Methane; Microorganisms; Sustainable development; Environmental footprints; Environmental-friendly; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Human waste; Microbial communities; Sustainable management; Sustainable waste management; Syntrophic interactions; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079245844

Thus, this paper provides an empirical analysis of the essential constructs of Industry 4.0, and drivers and barriers for Industry 4.0. The paper is based on 270 valid answers to a questionnaire-survey distributed among Danish manufacturers. Regression analyses were used to test the proposed hypotheses. The results of the analyses reveal that the identified drivers and barriers for Industry 4.0 have a positive impact on the perceived relevance of Industry 4.0 among companies. Furthermore, the analyses show that the perceived relevance of Industry 4.0 among companies has a positive impact on companies that have moved manufacturing back and on companies that have moved manufacturing out and back. Conversely, the perceived relevance of Industry 4.0 among companies has a negative impact on companies that have remained domestic. The perceived relevance of Industry 4.0 has no impact on companies that have moved manufacturing out.

One regional Danish public healthcare organization has systematically implemented an improvement culture in its psychiatry sector. This research paper contains an evaluation of the organization’s transformation journey towards continuous improvement in psychiatry. The study was based on twenty-five personal interviews, two group interviews and four focus group interviews with centre managers, doctors, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses and medical personnel in two of the ten psychiatry centres in the region. The objectives of implementing an improvement culture were to create better service for patients and to improve efficiency. Findings indicate that a number of critical success factors and barriers exist in mental healthcare and that even though a number of resources was invested up front, adjustments of the implementation process were needed from centre to centre. Furthermore, the implementation of a lean culture had some positive effects on treatments. In particular, internally, efficiency improved in some areas, creating a common view of what creates value and how to make improvements. Involving different groups of specialists in the implementation of an improvement culture is important. However, the achievement of continuous improvement efforts could be challenging, as results can be difficult to quantify. The novelty of the paper lies in the fact that data is collected from different groups of employees (from both managers’ and employees’ perspectives) on the effects of a full-scale implementation of an improvement culture in public mental healthcare. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Improvement culture; lean; mental healthcare; psychiatry; public sector","Efficiency; Human resource management; Managers; Continuous improvements; Critical success factor; Full-scale implementation; Implementation process; Improve performance; lean; psychiatry; Public sector; Health care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071298835

This work aims to design and develop the integrated network of biochemical and biofuel productions into existing pulp mills for sustainable purposes. The systematic methodology aided by computation tools is undertaken using the three-stage approach including process synthesis, design and innovation. Previously, the optimal technologies of the biorefinery-integrated pulping processes were successfully determined in the synthesis stage providing the highest cost-effective incorporation; 48 million USD/year of profit was estimated according to the integration of succinic acid and dimethyl ether productions into the soda pulping process. Herein, the process designs of the integrated processes were performed followed by evaluations of the process performances and identifications of the hot spots and targets for establishments of the innovations. In this work, the biomass gasification option is designed and implemented to enhance the material and energy utilizations in the previously determined biorefinery-integrated pulping processes. Electricity and biofuel are produced and sold, which contributes positively to the economic and environmental impacts of these processes. The hot spots and targets are subsequently identified prior to the innovation stage. According to this stage, the cleaner alternatives that implements the CO2 utilization via methanol synthesis and solar cell installations are selected in order to minimize the CO2 emission. A net CO2 reduction of 42% is achieved when the cleaner alternatives are applied. Accordingly, these biorefinery-integrated innovations are not only conducive to the enhanced sustainability of existing pulp mills but also adaptive in response to the change of paper consumption trend. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Dimethyl ether; Process integration; Pulp and paper industry; Succinic acid","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Ethers; Paper; Paper and pulp mills; Process design; Pulp; Pulp manufacture; Refining; Sustainable development; Biorefineries; Dimethyl ethers; Process integration; Pulp and paper industry; Succinic acids; Paper and pulp industry; Carbon Dioxide; Cost Effectiveness; Ethers; Paper; Refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078681939

This work introduced the research problem as if small scale urban Plant Factories with Automated Lighting (ssPFAL) are a viable investment option in order to promote food supply security in the ever expanding distributed energy generation environment. It is examined if and how wind energy microgeneration (small scale wind turbines) could grow hand-in-hand with small-scale hydroponic systems providing an alternative income stream for the wind business owners and at the same time increase urban based vegetables production. The small scale wind industry could be developed further within cities if they operate as unified systems with ssPFAL. Tomato, basil, and lettuce were examined and it was proven that the latter were much more profitable under all scenarios. Tomato's Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was at all cases between 2.5 and 11.3%, while for basil and lettuce could even surpass 100%. The methodology governing the research process in order for an answer to be given to the research problem, will be presented in accordance to the energy, demand response, and energy demand in the rural and suburban environment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Hydroponics; Multiple revenue stream business model; Small scale wind turbines","Cost effectiveness; Earnings; Economic analysis; Food supply; Fruits; Lighting; Sustainable development; Wind power; Wind turbines; Artificial lighting; Business modeling; Distributed energies; Hydroponic systems; Hydroponics; Internal rate of return; Small scale wind turbines; Small-scale plants; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078673984

There is a compelling need to develop a simple technology for reuse of organic matter in the pretreatment liquor to achieve a more value-added product with high application potential in agriculture and benefit environmental sustainability. The objective of this study is to examine a strategy for synthesizing humic-like acid under H₂O₂ oxidation by using biomass pretreatment liquor as a precursor and evaluate their electron transferring capacity and metal-binding potential. The results show that 8% H₂O₂, a temperature of 40 °C, and a reaction time of 2 h yielded humic-like acid up to 2.9 g L−1. Meanwhile, the recovery of total phenols, total sugars, proteins, and amino acids in the pretreatment liquor was 82.8, 56.2, 78.1, and 64.2%, respectively. Compared to the commercial humic acid, humic-like acid has a more uniform particle size and higher C (22.5%), N (2.3%), O (33.8%), K (4.5%), and P (11.2%) contents. The hydroxyl and carboxyl group contents were 3.3 and 2.0 times higher in humic-like acid than that in humic acid, respectively. Moreover, humic-like acid has more electron transferring capacity as well as metal-binding potential than commercial humic acid, suggesting the great application potential for remediation of heavy metal polluted soils. The reported strategy of synthesizing humic-like acid from pretreatment liquor in this study would promote the process of cleaner production of biorefinery industry as well as circular economy in agriculture. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Humic-like acid; Pretreatment liquor; Structure characterization","Agriculture; Binding energy; Electron transitions; Environmental technology; Heavy metals; Organic acids; Particle size; Pollution control; Soil pollution; Sustainable development; Biomass pre treatments; Carboxyl group contents; Electron transferring; Environmental sustainability; Heavy metal polluted soils; Humic-like acids; Pre-Treatment; Structure characterization; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078656348

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study is based on four data sets: online observations of employee ideation on ISM from 2011 to 2018, semi-structured interviews and informal conversations with two managers (2015–2016), archival material, and semi-structured interviews with 14 employees (2017–2018) in a large, knowledge-intensive Danish organization. Findings: The study identified various enablers and barriers to engagement related to psychological engagement conditions of meaningfulness, safety and availability. Managers’ communication role or importance of innovation, as well as tensions, e.g. obligation vs option to ideate or employee influence vs no influence, were identified as enabling or constraining employee engagement in ideation on ISM. Research limitations/implications: Broadening interviews to include employees who decided not to participate in online ideation would increase insights and nuance this study’s results. Practical implications: Managers need to be aware of the psychological engagement conditions and balance identified enablers, barriers and tensions by acknowledging communication reciprocity on ISM. Not only employees, but also managers, are dialogue partners in employee ideation on ISM. Originality/value: The study is one of the first to explore enablers of and barriers to psychological engagement conditions in a context central to corporate communication, namely internal innovation communication on ISM, and to study ideation from a coworker perspective. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee communication; Employee engagement; Employee ideation; Internal innovation communication; Internal social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076522886

Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a conceptual framework based on the integration of several strands of literature in business studies and information systems. To test the proposed model, data were collected from 300 Chinese firms which have adopted cloud computing. To analyze the data, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used. An importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) was also conducted to identify the critical factors that exhibit high importance but low performance. Findings: The results of the study revealed that end-user satisfaction, information quality, system quality, managerial information technology (IT) capability and technical IT capability significantly affect cloud computing success. Additionally, cloud computing success has a strong and positive impact on firm performance. IPMA further confirms that managers need to concentrate more on system quality, information quality, user satisfaction and technical IT capability.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper focuses on the association of “shadow organizing” with post-epistemologies that are grounded in process ontology. The investigation examines aspects of relational thinking and is guided by John Dewey and Arthur Bentley’s genealogical reconstruction of modes of inquiry. Findings: Inquiry is construed in either substantialist or relational ways by researchers. By using the metaphor of “shadow organizing,” the relational aspects of organizational phenomena are prioritized for explorative purposes. Other research objectives are aided by substantialist modes of inquiry. It is the argument of the paper, however, that relational research approaches need not make commitment to process ontology, and that the relational ambitions imbued in the metaphor of shadow organizing are in fact better honored for their methodological virtues. Originality/value: The paper’s original contribution consists in critiquing post-epistemological attempts to ground organization studies in ontological first principles of process metaphysics.

Drawing on ten semi-structured interviews and observations of the materiality of allotments, this study explores the enactment of allotment gardening as leisure. Findings demonstrate tensions and complexities in this leisure experience. Firstly, it shows that allotment gardening entails both the experience of freedom and enjoyment and a contrasting sense of duty. Secondly, the study suggests that the freely exercised activity of the individual plotter is negotiated within a dependency on the social structures of the allotment community. Thirdly, the study indicates that ecological orientations amongst plotters are expressed through gardening practices rather than articulated as ideologies. Finally, it demonstrates the potential of a material and consumption perspective in explorations of how both environmental concerns and/or materialism is practised through everyday leisure. Overall, the study contributes to multi-faceted understandings of motivations for allotment gardening and dynamics in the garden as a project of self-fulfilment and care for nature. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Allotments; eco-leisure; gardening; leisure meanings; material culture; nature","allotment; cultivation; environmental management; garden; leisure industry; recreational activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087434619

These logics capture the dominant ways of thinking in BPM, reflected in its assumptions, practices and values. While the three logics have proven useful in prior contexts, we argue that the applicability of these underlying assumptions in theorising BPM needs to be re-examined in the context of digital transformation. Based on an ethnographic study of BPM in a company undergoing digital transformation, we uncover tensions related to applying these prior logics that point to the need to update the underlying assumptions. Consequently, we propose new logics that we conceptualise as light touch processes (process), infrastructural flexibility (infrastructure) and mindful actors (agency). Our observations contribute to a rethinking of the dominant BPM logics by unpacking their dynamics in the context of digital transformation.

This paper integrates emerging evidence and critical thinking into three areas: (1) concept, (2) measurement and methodological issues, and (3) the context of presenteeism. First, due to the variety of existing definitions, competing understandings, as well as the notion of positive presenteeism, it is important to reconsider the notion of presenteeism. Second, it is important to reflect on the measurement of the act of presenteeism and the productivity loss associated with that.

Since 2001, Danish cultural-historical museums have been legally required to promote the preservation of significant heritage assets in historical buildings and environments of recent modern history. Taking three provincial municipalities and their local museums as the empirical starting point, this interview study was aimed at shedding light on a specific branch of museum collaborations where the enactment of heritage in relation to public planning administration is at stake. Several challenges confronting museum professionals in this field were identified. However, analytically investigating co-existence also revealed that effective ways of overcoming the aforementioned challenges are constituted occasionally during the collaborations. Finally, it is suggested that a self-reflective continuation of engagement in practical projects might be just as effective for improving museum–municipal collaborations as an adjustment of legal regulations in this area. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","built cultural heritage; co-existence; municipalities; Museum collaborations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075462960

We parametrize the lower-level solutions and thereby the upper-level objective function by the upper-level variables and argue that it may be non-convex and even discontinuous. However, when the upper-level objective is affine in the lower-level primal optimal solution, the parametric function is piece-wise linear. We show how this property facilitates the application of parametric programming and demonstrate how the approach allows for decomposition of a separable lower-level problem. When the upper-level objective is bilinear in the lower-level primal and dual optimal solutions, we also provide an exact linearisation method that reduces the bilevel problem to a single-level mixed-integer linear programme (MILP). We assess the performance of the parametric programming approach on two case studies of strategic investment in electricity markets and benchmark against state-of-the-art MILP and non-linear solution methods for bilevel optimisation problems. Preliminary results indicate substantial computational advantages over several standard solvers, especially when the lower-level problem separates into a large number of subproblems.

We show how the managerial discourse of rehabilitation mobilizes the care aides to transform their identity from traditional nurturing to rehabilitation, as a result of promoting the latter as more professional. While the traditional managers/nurses promote the identity transfer through more classic discursive regulation at a distance from ‘the office’, the therapists do so through what we label performative regulation. Performative regulation is exercised by the therapists performing the desired role at the frontline and thus embodies the ideal and transfers it by embodied practices, not directives.

Through an empirical investigation, I show how the vision values encourage members to take initiative in realizing their own political ideas, while the humanity values encourage them to remain morally inclusive towards people with different views. The combination of vision and humanity values allows The Alternative to maintain commitment from members who might otherwise feel marginalized by the emergence of dominant ideas within the party.

The concerted action between the two is implemented by the economic test to counter abusive legal holding structures. From a quantitative perspective, the rulings limit the potential for multinational enterprises to lower their tax burden considerably.

(A. Christians, Buying in: Residence and Citizenship by Investment, 62 St. Louis U. L.J. 51 (2017)). This new tax incentive challenges the traditional perception of formal citizenship as the basis for bestowing political rights and benefits as it may be argued that this practise erodes its value and meaning in addition to emphasizing the differentiation between individuals regarding their state of origin (particularly noticeable when considering EU citizens compared to non-EU citizens) and economic status. At the present time, mobile individuals may, as a result of disparities between tax allocations, formal citizenship and voting privileges, contribute financially to a state yet not be afforded the opportunity to exercise influence over their tax situation due to the lack of formal citizenship and voting privileges in said state. The group who may influence taxation and public spending (tax and spend) through voting, therefore, is not always the same as those who pay taxes. This issue is naturally complex as the group of individuals excluded from such political influence is a highly diverse one encompassing high-net individuals to stateless persons seeking asylum who are subject to individual circumstances and needs. This article separates itself from previous research within the tax scholarship as it does not focus on tax nexus nor on the right to participate in democratic influencing but rather on how individuals may influence tax and spend themselves with methods other than traditional voting. Otherwise stated, would it be possible for individuals who contribute to a state financially yet have no possibilities to exercise influence over tax and spend through voting due to the lack of formal citizenship be able to influence in a different manner? Tax rules and constitutional safeguards offering taxpayer protection gathered from Sweden, Germany and the United States are introduced in order to describe and analyse to what extent a taxpayer may exercise such influence. The article concludes that affluent individuals often have greater access to such legal instruments, and it subsequently indicates that political power is awarded to the few rather than the many. Moreover, it argues for a current revision to how political rights and benefits are allocated, not only at domestic level but also in the international context. The article inherently forms one component of a larger body of work that was composed under the umbrella of political (tax) equity in a global context in which this author explored how increased taxpayer mobility challenges not only traditional legal frameworks that are associated with taxation but also the allocation of political rights and benefits. The traditional perception of citizenship as the basis for voting rights is, as illustrated through various publications linked to the project, found to be inadequate when dealing with mobile taxpayers. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands","citizenship; comparative; constitutional safeguards; democracy; globalization; individual taxation; judicial review; political rights; tax competition; tax equity; tax incentives; taxpayer mobility; voting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100676988

The case exemplifies how sharing economy currently is taken up by public actors in the attempt to prolong the goals of the public sector beyond itself. This implies drawing everyday sharing practices into a new middle between formal organization and private relations. In a critical response to literature on sharing economy that tends to reduce 'sharing' to 'transaction', the article draws attention to how sharing entangles with hopes, fears, and affectual engagements of everyday life, and to how it interacts with technology in unforeseen ways and beyond anticipated outcomes. Based on the analysis, the article concludes that there may be good reasons for public welfare authorities to engage in facilitating sharing among citizens. This is not because it is likely to provide 'more for less' in relation to predetermined goals, but rather because it can open up other kinds of welfare outcomes that cannot be produced by public organizations themselves. © 2020 Technology Innovation Management Review.

Modern European organizational theories are on the other hand almost obsessed by emotions and especially affect. Emotion re-entered organizational theory around the limited topic of ‘emotional labour', but today, passion is generally praised as a driver in successful organizations. An important element here is the demand upon passionate employees to install the organization as their significant other. To the extent that they rely on this new concept of themselves and their employees, organizations become dependent upon the authenticity of the ‘self-enrolment' expected of each employee. In the discursive field of organization, we therefore see a number of new communicative media, which centre upon emotion and upon helping the organization to attribute authenticity and inauthenticity to employees. This paper also makes the case that these media are liminal in nature and extend beyond the use of discursive symbolism in a Sisyphean effort to reach the authentic emotional ‘heart' of each employee. © 2020 The Authors.

It adds to research on voluntary work by illustrating a set of strategies for organizing volunteers that are radically different from the more controlling strategies that have previously been studied.

A sub-group analysis, using industry (manufacturing/service) and economy (developed/developing), was also performed to study the relative strength of sustainability-firm performance relationships in respective categories. The study confirms a positive association between the various aspects of sustainability and firm performance and finds that the strength of sustainability-firm performance relationships grows over time. Findings also suggest a stronger relationship between sustainability-firm performances in manufacturing industries than in service industries.

Using firm-product-level data on production, exports and imports for a sample of Danish manufacturing firms, we present three key correlations. First, exported varieties are on average sold at lower prices relative to only domestically sold varieties. Second, exported varieties have higher quality measured by ‘demand residuals’ (i.e., they have larger sales conditional on price). Finally, exported varieties are produced using cheaper imported intermediates. We introduce the term ‘quality-cum-price sorting’ to describe this sorting environment. The observed sorting behaviour in terms of output quality and import prices works not just across firms, but also within multi-product firms across the product portfolio. In contrast, the negative exporter premium in terms of output prices vanishes once firm-level unobservables are accounted for—consistent with the idea that unobserved firm efficiency is driving the negative correlation. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Exporter premia; Firm Sorting; Firm-level data; Price; Quality","correlation; export; import; manufacturing; price determination; quality control; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082058639

Hence, in order to decide upon a suitable treatment plan, health professionals benefit from decision support, i.e., predictions about how a disease is to evolve. In clinical practice, such a prediction model requires interpretability. Interpretability, however, is often precluded by complex dynamic models that would be capable of capturing the intrapersonal variability of disease trajectories. Therefore, we develop a cross-sectional ARMA model that allows for inference of the expected course of symptoms. Distinct from traditional time series models, it generalizes to cross-sectional settings and thus patient cohorts (i.e., it is estimated to multiple instead of single disease trajectories). Our model is evaluated according to a longitudinal 52-week study involving 928 patients with low back pain. It achieves a favorable prediction performance while maintaining interpretability. In sum, we provide decision support by informing health professionals about whether symptoms will have the tendency to stabilize or continue to be severe. © 2020 The Authors","Cohort data; Disease management; Healthcare analytics; Longitudinal monitoring; Low back pain; Time series analysis","Decision support systems; Forecasting; Health care; Time series analysis; Clinical practices; Cohort data; Complex dynamic models; Disease management; Health professionals; Low back pain; Prediction performance; Time series models; Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082024375

Our study shows that information flows from patents measured by forward citations, increased. Interestingly, the degree of localization within geographic boundaries remained unchanged and technological localization even increased moderately. Moreover, the effect of early disclosure on citations from patents filed by patent attorney service firms is particularly strong.

These dynamic processes have proliferated intercultural connectivity, catalyzing both exclusionary reactions of ethnic protection and integrative reactions of multicultural acquisition. To be able to negotiate a globalized cultural diversity, the individual needs to be securely and reliably embedded within the local sociocultural context conceptualized as secure life attachment. The present study investigates the interplay among life attachment, psychological reactions to cultural globalization, and various aspects of radicalization in student samples from Denmark (n = 223) and India (n = 254). Results reveal that insecure life attachment was directly associated with an extremist attitude and with endorsement of both violent and illegal means in relation to extremism. Furthermore, multicultural acquisition and ethnic protection appear to mediate the relationship between insecure life attachment and various aspects of radicalization. Insecure life attachment relates to an extremist attitude and acceptance of illegal means in relation to extremism through ethnic protection. Additionally, insecure life attachment is associated with acceptance of violent means in relation to extremism through both ethnic protection and multicultural acquisition. The results illustrate the key role of contextual safety and reliability as platforms for approaching cultural globalization and avoiding radicalized essentialist pitfalls. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acculturation; Extremism; Globalization; Localization; Radicalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081006705

We reveal the concerns of authors as they have sought to apply foresight in corporations, organizations, and institutions; how they have attempted to resolve the concerns; and the progress the authors have made. We discuss how these authors have cumulatively defined and evolved this portion of the strategic foresight field, from integrating technology with market forecasting, to expanding forecast approaches to include multiple futures and integrating foresight to create agile and adaptive organizations. We use this as a base for discussing current priorities and future challenges in corporate and organizational foresight and suggest three trajectories for further research: (a) further advancing organizational foresight practices; (b) connecting organizational foresight to strategy practice and theory; (c) and connecting organizational foresight to innovation, engineering, and R&D management practices and theory. © 2020","Corporate foresight; Discontinuities; Forecasting; Futures; Literature review; Organizational foresight; Planning; Scenarios; Technology roadmapping","Forecasting; Planning; Corporate foresight; Discontinuities; Futures; Literature reviews; Organizational foresight; Scenarios; Technology roadmapping; Technological forecasting; corporate strategy; forecasting method; future prospect; literature review; social change; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079867389

We investigate whether and how founders can differently influence future entrepreneurial career choices of their male and female joiners. Using a large sample of startup firms with personnel where founders interact closely with joiners, we demonstrate that founders have a strong influence on a joiner's entrepreneurial career choice if both are female. We find empirical support for role modeling as a key underlying mechanism, accounting for alternative explanations such as selective matching based on gender and push-driven factors. These findings increase our understanding of the roles of socialization and organizational context in shaping the career outcomes of employees, and provide evidence of a multiplier effect of female entrepreneurs. Managerial summary: Women are less likely to be entrepreneurs than men. We investigate whether working in a startup founded by a woman instead of a man influences individuals' decision to become an entrepreneur later. We find this to be the case for women. This result is best explained by female founders acting as role models for their female employees in male-dominated domains. Female founders able to break gender stereotypes seem to have an influence on the career choices of their female employees, especially among those who have lacked contact with entrepreneurs. Moreover, this influence is stronger if the female founder and employee have similar backgrounds. These findings confirm the importance of social interactions at work and suggest new ways to inspire more women to launch startups. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","entrepreneurship; female leadership; gender gaps; organizations; role models","Empowerment of personnel; Personnel; Societies and institutions; Entrepreneurial careers; entrepreneurship; Female entrepreneurs; Female leadership; gender gaps; New venture creation; Organizational context; Role model; Biographies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078678131

With the intention to use IFA in a cleaner and more sustainable manner, the current work focuses on exploring the possibility of utilizing IFA for civil engineering applications. The idea is to prepare high ductile engineering materials using IFA, i.e. alkali-activated fiber reinforced composites or IFA-AAFRCs. The results showed that excellent mechanical properties can be obtained with the IFA replacement ratio even up to 40%. The maximum tensile strength, tensile strain capacity and compressive strength at 28 days can reach 2.78 MPa, 5.19% and 73.78 MPa, respectively. The meso-scale studies, including three-point bending test, single-crack tensile test and single fiber pullout test, revealed that the IFA replacement (10% and 40% IFA) can improve the micromechanical properties which are responsible for high ductility. Microstructural analyses using SEM and EDS demonstrated that the IFA replacement is beneficial in generating more amorphous gel products, leading to a dense and compacted microstructure. In addition, a preliminary study was conducted to evaluate the leaching behavior of heavy metals from the composites. The results showed that the prepared composites are rather effective in immobilizing toxic heavy metals. Based on all the obtained results, it can be concluded that the composites are promising for civil engineering applications, especially for cases where high ductility is demanded. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkali-activated materials; Fiber reinforced composite; Heavy metals; Incineration fly ash; Municipal solid waste","Compressive strength; Ductility; Fiber reinforced metals; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Reinforcement; Tensile strain; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Waste incineration; Alkali activated; Civil engineering applications; Fiber reinforced composites; Incineration fly ashes; Microstructural analysis; Single-fiber pull-out test; Tensile strain capacities; Three-point bending test; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078298118

The objective of this paper is to analyse the state of the art regarding consumers’ response to environmentally-friendly food packaging in order to identify existing barriers to purchase and potential measures to overcome these barriers. The paper is based on a systematic synthesis of 46 scientific journal articles on consumer studies related to environmentally-friendly packaging. The literature review applies a conceptual framework regarding the ways consumers respond to product stimuli and the psychological processes involved. Three important barriers to purchasing environmentally-friendly packaging are identified. First, consumers need guidance in recognizing environmentally-friendly packaging; for while consumers primarily consider the packaging material itself and any eco-labels, they also consider other packaging design elements such as colours and pictures of ‘nature’ that can be misleading. Second, it became obvious that consumers lack knowledge, in particular about new packaging materials like bio-based packaging. Third, many of the studies reviewed provide evidence that other product attributes such as price and product quality are more important to consumers than environmentally-friendly packaging. Nevertheless, some studies recorded a significantly higher willingness on the part of consumers to buy and pay for environmentally-friendly packaging and products with reduced packaging compared to products with standard packaging, signalling an overall positive attitude. The literature review revealed many research gaps. For example, it became obvious that consumers’ response to environmentally-friendly food packaging is not yet well understood, in particular with regards to purchasing behaviour (in the real world as opposed to in a survey setting) and measures for overcoming existing barriers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer; Environmentally-friendly; Food; Green; Packaging; Sustainable","Food products; Packaging; Packaging machines; Sales; Conceptual frameworks; Consumer; Environmentally-friendly; Green; Market penetration; Psychological process; Scientific journals; Sustainable; Packaging materials",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078180790

Its motivation lies in the increasing global political, social, academic as well as practical importance of managing and reporting on carbon-related issues. Methodologically, we employ a systematic literature review. Thus, we identify 73 quantitative peer-reviewed empirical studies in this field and categorize them according to a legitimacy-theory-based framework. Our four main contributions offer new insights into this emerging research field and provide guidance for the development of new research models: First, we help future researchers to structure this emerging field of research with respect to the interactions of the phenomenon itself (carbon performance vs. disclosure), its determinants (country- and firm-related governance), and its financial consequences (value relevance, information asymmetry, financial performance, and cost of capital). Second, we provide a comprehensive overview of variables and proxies used in the studies and list their main statistical effects, which facilitates building novel models. There are indications that 1) board composition positively influences both carbon performance and disclosure, 2) carbon performance and carbon disclosure are positively connected, 3) carbon disclosure reduces information asymmetry, and 4) carbon performance increases financial performance. Third, we develop a research agenda with concise suggestions for future studies. Fourth, we argue that due to the under-theorization of concepts the comparability of included studies is challenging, this research field may be characterized as a vibrant field for extensive future research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon disclosure; Carbon performance; Corporate governance; Financial performance; Legitimacy theory; Management control","Finance; Carbon disclosures; Carbon performance; Corporate governance; Financial performance; Legitimacy theories; Management control; Carbon",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077953045

Drawing on 25 in-depth interviews with policymakers, the paper finds that conceptual vagueness and a lack of clear definitions within the field have led to a myriad of terms being used to refer to the engagement of end-users in the sustainable innovation process. This lack of clarity has generated a confused policy narrative when discussing the role of end-user in sustainable innovation, making it difficult for insights to be shared with and drawn from others and resulting in a fragmented policy toolset. In addition to this ambiguity, the interviews revealed that policymakers often take a traditional view of innovation and its main actors, wherein end-users are seen as playing the role of ‘the informed consumer’ who drives the demand side but does not contribute to supply. Thus, despite significant evidence to the contrary, policymakers remain apprehensive about the potential of end-users driving sustainable innovation. The paper concludes that existing policy concerns are less about whether end-users innovate or not than whether this form of innovation can actually translate into public goods. The key takeaway for proponents of sustainable end-user innovation is that, from a policy perspective, the larger impact and business case has yet to be made. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","End-users; Open innovation; Policy; Policymakers; Sustainable innovation; User innovation","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Public policy; Business case; End users; In-depth interviews; Innovation process; Open innovation; Policy makers; Socio-technical transitions; User innovation; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077931554

Study 1 showed that quality signals from other consumers (product rating) had the highest importance score in an online setting when compared to traditional attributes in a conjoint experiment. Study 2 again confirmed the prominence of quality signals from consumers by extending the research over to brick and mortar retailing and top-selling items.

To indicate and measure the positional status of the EU, I applied social network analysis to data on the exchange of embassies from 1960 to 2010. This methodology allows for consistent longitudinal comparisons of standing between heterogeneous polities in world politics. The results indicate that the EU's rise in the status hierarchy has been meteoric since 1960.

Across four studies, we demonstrate that freedom threat is an antecedent of psychological reactance to a pro-environmental normative appeal. We further show that the impact of pro-environmental normative appeals on behavioral intentions is serially mediated through freedom threat and counterarguing. Descriptive (injunctive) normative appeals produce lower (higher) psychological reactance, which subsequently leads to higher (lower) behavioral intentions. Finally, we provide evidence that the above relationships depend on self-construal, with descriptive normative appeals provoking lower psychological reactance than injunctive normative appeals only when the interdependent self is activated.

Despite its popularity, crafting the right set of buckets to allocate resources is not a straightforward task. We consider the question of how to establish a set of buckets that aligns the R&D portfolio with the business strategy. We carried out a case-based research and investigate seven companies in order to propose a framework to assist decision makers in designing this set of buckets. Our framework is composed of four strategic constructs, namely, technology, market, capabilities, and organizational processes. In addition to these four constructs, we suggest that the external environment also be taken into account. We discuss the key benefits and offer theoretical insights concerning the strategic constructs, which can be combined and divided, resulting in a set of buckets that better suits a company's strategy. In addition, we acknowledge the idiosyncratic nature of firms and, as opposed to prescribing a static approach for companies, we suggest the design of buckets as a dynamic process to be performed according to the four different constructs, together with a firm's interaction with the external environment. We close by discussing the implications of our approach. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Case studies; research and development (R AND D) portfolio; strategic alignment; strategic buckets","Decision making; Industry; Planning; Case-studies; Interviews; Portfolios; Research and development; Resource management; Strategic alignment; strategic buckets; Technological innovation; Research and development management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055862926

This is done by introducing a sensuous and embodied focus to mundane weather that is also encountered on holiday. Drawing on conceptions of embodiment, the everyday and sensuous, I argue that experiences of weather are relational and multisensuous. This article has three aims. First, to nuance discourses on weather by researching people’s embodied and sensuous negotiations of weather. Second, to broaden understandings of holiday weather beyond that of sunny destinations. And third, proposing the concept of “weathering” to inform the relatively neglected role of everyday weather in tourism research.

Findings: A conceptual model to analyse impact factors for HWs covers the influence of many different variables. Most papers only discuss a particular influencing factor, mainly plants and indoor climate. Various papers show that the spatial layout, in particular the level of openness and opportunities for communication, concentration and privacy and interior design have an important impact on user satisfaction, perceived productivity support and creativity.

The article explores how governance structures are transformed from a top-down, state-driven model towards a ‘third way’, with more extensive collaborative and participative structures. The willingness to volunteer in the Wadden Sea National Park in Denmark is examined in detail. The volunteers constitute a considerable labour resource. Volunteers participate in well-structured events, such as beach clean-ups and festivals, but they increasingly assist with facilities maintenance, nature restoration, citizen science activities, etc. Findings show that residents from the vicinity of the national park express the most interest, but visitors from other parts of Denmark are also willing to volunteer. This suggests a strong potential for integrating volunteering with tourist experiences and meaningful engagements with others.

In a study of the on-going Norwegian local government amalgamation reform, we demonstrate that this type of government agency reacts by hoarding (i.e., a last-minute flurry of spending) when faced with a termination threat. This finding shows that agencies facing termination threats are active players in the termination game.

While existing research on volunteer involvement in service production, for example, has focused on advantages and disadvantages of such involvement and different dimensions of volunteer involvement, little is known about service professionals' response to volunteer involvement in public service production. Integrating perspectives from multiple theories, we build a theoretical framework for understanding how and when service professionals come to see volunteers as a threat to the quality of service, the profession's privileged position and monopoly, and professionals' own work tasks and job security. Based on a central distinction between production of core and complementary tasks, we propose that volunteers come to be seen as a threat in the eyes of service professionals when volunteers solve core rather than complementary tasks. Using a survey experiment among health assistants at nursing homes, we find partial support for our argument. Health assistants are more likely to perceive volunteers as a threat to the quality of care when volunteers solve core rather than complementary tasks. The study guides research toward a more nuanced understanding of volunteer involvement in service production in public organizations. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

While extant literature paints a clear picture of the drivers of process innovation, the effect of process innovation on performance has received little attention. This paper aims to examine how the divergence of process innovation impacts performance. Divergence concerns the extent to which the observed level of process innovation diverges from the expected level of process innovation. Positive divergence occurs when the observed level of process innovation is higher than expected while for negative divergence the opposite occurs. In turn, the authors consider how divergence acts as a driver of performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use survey and archival data from 5,594 firms across 15 countries. The authors analyze the data using an advanced two-step random-effects estimator that accounts for the multi-level data used. Findings: The authors find negative divergence to reduce performance under high competitive intensity, whereas positive divergence is detrimental under high environmental uncertainty. Research limitations/implications: The authors present new and unique insights into the relationship between divergence and performance. The authors argue that each firm has an “ideal” level of process innovation, based on their resources and business environment, relative to which performance diminishes. Specifically, the authors argue that divergence from the firm’s expected level of process innovation is associated with the reduced performance during high environmental uncertainty or high competitive intensity. Furthermore, the authors argue that there can be “too much” process innovation. This nuance of the majority of prior empirical studies in this area suggests that more innovation is always better for firms. The more nuanced approach reveals that the process innovation-performance debate should not focus on more or less innovation per se, but on how innovation is constructed and supported. Practical implications: Some argue the existence of an academia-practitioner gap, with both living in different worlds (Reibstein et al., 2009). The findings suggest that theory is not only useful to practitioners but also has a crucial and central role regarding decisions relating to efficiency and effectiveness of scarce resources, in the field of process innovation. More specifically, the authors demonstrate that the prior study on process innovation seems to be useful in that relative to a theory-predicted level, divergence diminishes performance in the global sample of companies across a wide range of industries. In addition, the authors suggest that firms should not strive for more innovation per se. The findings suggest that positive divergence or too much innovation is detrimental for performance under environmental uncertainty, while negative divergence or too little innovation is harmful to performance under competitive uncertainty. Moreover, the divergence approach is also useful for comparing performance to that of other firms, typically referred to as benchmarking. Originality/value: This paper is useful and important for managers and theory development as it provides insight into situations where a firm may have “too little” or “too much” process innovation. Thus, divergence advances understanding as, in contrast with the previous study, the authors do not suggest that more innovation is always better. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Marketing strategy; Organisational innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083530640

Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a social network analysis method based on the data of high and new tech companies from Jiangxi province, China. It relies on Ucinet 6.212 software for data processing. Findings: The present work, on the one hand, reveals that a high and new tech company from Jiangxi province tends to achieve better innovation performances if it is in the central position of its social network.

Originality/value: The conclusions of this paper suggest that a high and new tech company from a less-developed area in China should build up its position closer to the center when constructing a social network. Meanwhile, the company should also exert more effort into managing its networks, as only building structural holes offers little help with operations besides showing that it has a broad social network. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","High and new tech companies; Innovation performance; Jiangxi province; Network position; Social network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075935359

Although previous research has developed cost-effective processes for food waste treatment, the significance of embedded resources in food waste, especially the unreplaceable and depleting phosphorus, has been overlooked. This paper quantifies food waste in China at the provincial level by considering both at-home and away-from-home consumption, where phosphorus loss factor derived from substance flow analysis will be used to estimate phosphorus loss along the food supply chain. The results provide meaningful information regarding the volume and composition of food waste, as well as its impact on phosphorus resource and the environment at the provincial level. The calculation confirmed that at-table food waste was 53.7 million tons in 2015, while the embedded phosphorus was 86,300 tons. The off-table phosphorus loss was then back-calculated along the food supply chain, showing a total phosphorus loss of 424,400 tons, which was equivalent to 16.4% of the total mineral phosphate fertilizer consumption in China. Given China's importance on the global food cycle, effective phosphorus management along the food supply chain, at-table food waste minimization and phosphorus recovery are recommended to close the current imbalanced phosphorus cycle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Food supply chain; Food waste; Phosphorus; Substance flow analysis","Conservation; Cost effectiveness; Food supply; Phosphate fertilizers; Supply chains; Waste treatment; Food waste; Home consumption; Phosphorus cycles; Phosphorus loss; Phosphorus management; Phosphorus recovery; Substance flow analysis; Total phosphorus; Phosphorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077116080

The waste-to-energy networks studied in this contribution include the following main systems: (1) wastewater treatment plants for biogas production, (2) a biogas upgrading process for biomethane generation, and (3) a molten carbonate fuel cell together with a Rankine cycle to harness green electricity. Waste streams in the proposed model consist of wastewater from wastewater treatment plants and waste steam from central utility systems itself. The derived green electricity is utilized to satisfy the energy demands in central utility systems. A waste-to-energy network is simulated by simulation tools, and a mixed integer linear programming problem is formulated to optimize central utility systems based on the simulation results. A case study of the Yeosu petrochemical industrial complex in South Korea evaluates the developed model. The total economic costs of the optimized central utility systems based on the integrated model are reduced by approximately 15% compared to the existing central utility systems.

Research has focused on determining how industrial symbioses come about and develop. Characteristics and dynamics of their emergence as well as their development processes have been identified. However, within this field, little attention has been paid to the effect of relations and interdependence between symbioses in the emergence process. The present paper addresses this gap. Its objective is to determine how existing industrial symbioses influence the emergence of new ones and contribute to industrial symbiosis network development. In doing so, a conceptual model is built and presented, explaining the connection and dependence between existing and emerging industrial symbioses. The model is inspired by analogies with biological processes of reproduction, which are translated into industrial principles. Embedded in the model are the principal reproduction modes: budding, broadcast spawning, and brooding. To validate and illustrate the applicability of the model, the paper presents empirical cases selected from the industrial symbiosis network in Aalborg, Denmark. Based on findings of the case study, the model of industrial symbiosis reproduction is found to be a useful tool for gaining a new perspective on industrial symbiosis networks’ development.

Using social identity theory and commitment theory as the foundation, this study evaluates a management and leadership development program (MLDP) intended to engage middle managers as strategy creators and implementers. We also evaluate the cascading effects of leadership development by assessing changes in subordinates' identification with the leader, and commitment to the work unit and organization. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of 107 manager participants and 913 of their subordinates, this study measures differences in both manager and subordinate identification and commitment prior to and after the completion of a 6 months strategically oriented MLDP. Findings: Despite the organizations' best intentions, manager identification with and commitment to the organization decreased after completion of the MLDP. Similarly, subordinates identification with the leader and commitment to the organization also decreased at Time 2. Research limitations/implications: The results paint a complex picture of the nuances of social identification as an outcome of MLDPs, and problematize the notion of cascading effects on subordinates within the organization.

A significant number of respondents feel that metal detecting has alleviated specific symptoms of their mental disorders (PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders). The key factors for the beneficial effect of metal detecting appear to be of a mental, sensory, physical and social nature.

Market demand for each of the manufacturer's products allows for both price and cross-price elasticities. We consider a Stackelberg game between the retailer and the two manufacturers and solve for the subgame perfect equilibrium wholesale price chosen by each of the manufacturers, the retail price charged by the retailer for each of two products, as well as the equilibrium demands for the two products. Unlike a classical dyadic supply chain, we show that only under certain allocations of the total profit between the manufacturers and the retailer is it the case that the vertically integrated chain is the preferred supply chain structure, even though it provides the highest total profit. An important result is that vertical integration is less advantageous when products are closer substitutes. We also show that a revenue sharing contract can coordinate this chain, but only when the manufacturers set their wholesale prices below their marginal costs of production. Finally, we show that the retailer can choose to integrate partially with one manufacturer to achieve a Pareto improving profit outcome. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","revenue sharing; Stackelberg game; Supply chain coordination; vertical integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057346105

It is differentiated from past ages, which were defined geologically. The Anthropocene Age is referred to as such due to massive, negative impacts of human activity on both the social and ecological landscapes, on a planetary level. Well known among such impacts are increasing desertification and ocean acidity; soil, water, and air pollution and contamination that contribute to approximately 40% of all deaths worldwide annually; climate change and an increase in extreme weather evens; rising sea levels threatening highly populated coastal regions; and water and food insecurity. While these challenges have been long in the making, their emergence in recent times is often traced to the so-called great acceleration that coincides with the first testing of the atomic bomb on 16 July 1945 in the desert sands of New Mexico, USA. While we as individuals have most certainly contributed to creation of these challenges, so to have we as enterprises. Enterprises have the responsibility to address these challenges.

Given an opportunity for collaboration with a large-scale Danish survey among practitioners of project management, we included clarification of the institutionalization of responsibility for project benefits realization. The investigation was conducted with institutional logic as a lens, and the contribution of this paper is a deeper understanding of the stakeholder diversity regarding responsibility for benefits realization and to the socio-political dimension of the complexity of project management. The findings from the survey demonstrate that one in three of the participants holds the project manager responsible for benefits realization – in contrast to the overall recommendations in guidelines and research literature.

It seeks to investigate how such data is handled by students, with special attention to so-called ‘questionable research practices’ (QRPs) where anomalous data are simply deleted or discarded. This question of QRPs is of particular importance as the educational practices students experience may influence how they act in their future professional careers, for instance in research. The ethical evaluation of QRPs however is not univocal. In parts of the literature QRPs are seen as unquestionably bad, while in other parts of the literature certain QRPs are seen as a necessary aspect of scientific practice. Results from the survey of Danish chemistry students shows that many students engage in certain types of questionable practices, and that a large minority of the students have been actively encouraged by their teachers to engage in such practices. The paper discusses to what extent and under what circumstances such instructional practices can be defended and suggests how the instructional practice connected to the handling of anomalous data can be improved. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Academic dishonesty; Laboratory practice; Professional ethics; Questionable research practices","human; methodology; publication; questionnaire; student; Humans; Publications; Research Design; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082342366

We address the challenge of location sorting by estimating the effects of initial local labour demand for refugees who were subject to the Danish Spatial Dispersal Policy from 1999–2010. After location assignment, refugees participate in a 3-year introduction programme; eligibility to means-tested welfare benefits during programme participation is conditional on residing in the assigned municipality. We use full population Danish administrative registers that contain information on admission class of immigrants and identify refugee status without any measurement error. Our findings show that four years after assignment, 83% of refugees still live in the assigned municipality. Moreover, assignment to a municipality with a one percentage point higher employment rate increases the employment probability of refugees by 0.5–0.6 percentage points (elasticities 1.1–1.8) two to four years after arrival in Denmark. We also find consistent significant effects of alternative measures of local labour demand on employment chances of refugees. Our results provide quasi-experimental evidence that immigrant employment is sensitive to labour market conditions in the initial location and highlight the importance of carefully designing refugee allocation policies. © 2020 The Authors","Asylum seekers; Employment; Immigrants; Natural experiment; Refugees; Settlement policies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081898126

The article argues that to fully understand problem definitions, programme design and organisational change processes related to gender equality, scholars and practitioners cannot focus one-sidedly on expected outcomes and effects; we must also factor in cultural narratives, because gender equality actors never arrive at their work as ‘tabulae rasae’. A community of actors always draws on shared dispositions that give sense, direction and shape to their anticipations of the future hereby guiding their actions in the present. Based on an ethnography of a multinational engineering company, the article shows how cultural narratives may serve in different ways as support factors for gender equality programme planning and implementation, if they are actively but mindfully engaged. This mindfulness is important as positive cultural narratives may entail problematic gender dimensions. On the other hand, negative cultural narratives may entail important learning outcomes that may benefit future gender equality initiatives. The analysis further points to the centrality of strategic communication, leadership commitment and comprehensive evaluation in order to mobilise the potential of cultural narratives as support factors to gender equality work. Finally, this article offers a rich example to scholars and practitioners of how to employ cultural analysis in relation to gender equality activities, and demonstrates the value of the insights produced by this analysis for the case company and its gender equality programme. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Engineering; Ethnography; Gender equality; Historicity; Organisational change","cultural geography; ethnography; future prospect; gender disparity; gender identity; gender role; organizational change; anticipation; article; ethnography; female; gender; human; leadership; learning; male; mindfulness; narrative; organizational culture; physician; program development; cultural anthropology; Denmark; engineering; family relation; organization; organization and management; program evaluation; psychology; risk assessment; salary and fringe benefit; verbal communication; workplace; Anthropology, Cultural; Denmark; Engineering; Family Relations; Gender Equity; Humans; Narration; Organizational Culture; Organizational Innovation; Program Evaluation; Risk Assessment; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079355854

For this we use merged population-wide registers on health and economic and demographic variables, including the national medical birth register and intergenerational link registers from Sweden covering 1992–2004. We take a rigorous econometric approach that exploits regional variation in unemployment and compares babies born to the same parents so as to deal with possible selective fertility based on labour market conditions. We find that downturns are beneficial; an increase in the unemployment rate during pregnancy reduces the probability of having a birth weight less than 1500 grams or of dying within 28 days of birth.

Life cycle inventory data from a SME meat processing site in regional Australia was used for benchmarking with existing industry data and for risk and opportunity identification along the supply chain. A LCA was conducted of the current operation and possible future energy supply scenarios involving the use of tallow, wastewater methane and biomass production, to identify the best performing option as part of a PhD project on SMEs and sustainability in agribusiness value chains. System expansion was used to handle all coproducts and byproducts. The area of land required to produce biomass was calculated and was compared to the catchment area for livestock, and an estimate was made of the non-arable land area required to produce biomass to offset all greenhouse emissions for the supply chain. Inventory data and LCA results for this SME were significantly different to previous LCAs. The system expansion resulted in large credits, particularly for edible offal. Climate change may not be a suitable proxy for other midpoint impact categories due to the difference in contributing processes. The best future energy appeared to be the biomass scenario, which involved using tallow for biodiesel production, capturing methane generated in the onsite wastewater treatment system for electricity generation, using tallow to generate the remaining electricity needs and using biomass for thermal energy production. Less than 0.5% of the non-arable land area required for producing the livestock for the plant was needed for biomass production, and if all supply chain emissions were offset using biomass, the land area required was 12% for life time grass fed beef. The potential for supply chain integration in the red meat sector appears promising, particularly in terms of offsets from biomethane use for electricity production, tallow use for biodiesel production and biomass production for thermal energy use. Life cycle assessment is a useful tool to screen circular economy options and identify the best future scenario, although a wide range of impact categories should be assessed as climate change may not be a suitable proxy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agribusiness supply chain integration; Biomass; Circular economy; Environmental sustainability; Gate-to-gate life cycle assessment; Non-arable land","Beef; Biodiesel; Biomass; Catchments; Climate change; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Food processing; Forestry; Land use; Methane; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Wastewater treatment; Arable land; Circular economy; Environmental sustainability; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Supply-chain integration; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076684510

To comprehensively evaluate the engineering performance of SFL stabilized soil, 3, 7, 10, 12 and 15% mixtures were tested and the influence of climate factors (assessed subjecting the soil to different freeze-thaw cycles) was also considered. The experimental program investigated mechanical strength (unconfined compressive strength) and physicochemical properties, which included grain size distribution, Atterberg limits, variation of elemental and mineral composition, pH, cation exchange capacity, X-ray diffraction/fluorescence and thermal conductivity. In addition, micro-characterization through SEM and pore size distribution was also performed. A considerable improvement of the mechanical properties was observed, which increases with SFL content up to 12%. This was based on changes in the physical and not chemical properties, hinting that the stabilization mechanism consists in physical binding unlike for traditional soil stabilizers. Moreover, it was found that SFL addition improved frost resistance. Based on these results, utilizing SFL as a soil stabilizer for application in earthworks shows great potential and would promote the bio-ethanol industry and engineering construction to be more sustainable and greener, particularly because it does not risk inducing soil pH contamination unlike traditional chemical agents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol waste elimination; Freeze-thaw cycles; Soil improvement; Sulfur-free lignin; Sustainable geotechnical engineering","Bioethanol; Compressive strength; Ethanol; Freezing; Frost resistance; Geotechnical engineering; Grain size and shape; Lignin; Physicochemical properties; Pore size; Size distribution; Soil conditioners; Soils; Sulfur; Thawing; Cation exchange capacities; Civil engineering constructions; Engineering constructions; Freeze-thaw cycles; Soil improvement; Sulfur-free lignin; Unconfined compressive strength; Waste eliminations; Stabilization; Compression Strength; Ethanol; Freezing; Frost Resistance; Pore Size",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076570395

In this paper we focus on the development of the share of women researchers in four national innovation systems, i.e. in Austria, Denmark, Hungary and Spain in the time period 2005-2015. The four selected cases represent countries with significant differences in their innovation capacity, gender regimes and progress of gender equality in R&I. A qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is carried out to conduct a sector program evaluation based on statistical data and qualitative studies to understand the dynamic development of the proportion of women researchers. The study aims to provide insights into the aggregated gender equality interventions and policies implemented in the four countries studied and their contributions to the development of the proportion of women scientists at the structural level. The analysis reveals that the development of the share of women researchers during the studied period has been particularly influenced by contextual factors, namely the relative size of the business enterprise sector and the share of women among holders of tertiary education. While this is the case, it is found that gender equality interventions need to be more widespread and more effectively designed to be a strong contributing factor to an increasing representation of women in R&I. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gender and education; Gender Equality in R&I; Gender regimes; Innovation systems; Program sector evaluation; Proportion of Women Researchers","academic research; European Union; gender relations; gender role; innovation; policy approach; qualitative analysis; research and development; womens status; adult; article; Austria; controlled study; Denmark; education; female; gender; human; human experiment; Hungary; male; program evaluation; qualitative research; Spain; academic success; cultural factor; decision making; Europe; policy; research; sex factor; Austria; Denmark; Europe; Hungary; Spain; Academic Success; Career Choice; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Europe; Gender Equity; Humans; Policy; Program Evaluation; Research; Sex Factors; Women, Working",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076126608

Our findings from a longitudinal embedded case study of a PFIN in the Nordic maritime industry show two key insights. First, we identify three patterns of inter-organisational relationships: functional (alignment between the self-organised relationships by project partners and relationship requirements from network administration), dysfunctional (contradictions between the self-organised relationships by project partners and relationship requirements from network administration), and anarchic (self-organised relationships by project partners with a lack of direction or leadership). Second, we show that each of these patterns of inter-organisational relationships have different effects on performance factors. An unexpected emergent finding was the observation of sub-circles of functional relationships within projects of dysfunctional relationships aimed at circumventing the misaligned requirements of network administration.

Exploring managerial intentionality, we acknowledge a central building block of cognitive science, which contrary to representations and computations has, by and large, been neglected in the management and organization literatures.

We therefore need to take better account of others’ perspectives (“speaking with”) whenever speaking for others. For this reason I emphasize that moral imagination does not constitute a solely individual cognitive act but must be thought of as a deliberative process. Second, while Tsoukas’ analysis suggests that the leadership of AOM should have made an exception to the rule on taking public stands, I show that such exceptions need to be justified communicatively, especially when dealing with moral questions.

More specifically, recent findings of algorithm aversion—the reluctance of human forecasters to use superior but imperfect algorithms—raise questions about whether joint human-algorithm decision making is feasible in practice. In this paper, we systematically review the topic of algorithm aversion as it appears in 61 peer-reviewed articles between 1950 and 2018 and follow its conceptual trail across disciplines. We categorize and report on the proposed causes and solutions of algorithm aversion in five themes: expectations and expertise, decision autonomy, incentivization, cognitive compatibility, and divergent rationalities. Although each of the presented themes addresses distinct features of an algorithmic decision aid, human users of the decision aid, and/or the decision making environment, apparent interdependencies are highlighted. We conclude that resolving algorithm aversion requires an updated research program with an emphasis on theory integration.

Based on repeated interviews with 10 managers participating in an open leadership development programme, our analysis shows that half of the participants reflected a sense of distancing themselves from how their organizations practiced leadership, and for some, an emotional disengagement with their home organization which we see as analogous to changes in social identity. We problematize the role of management and leadership development programmes with regard to the relationship between organizations and employees. A series of paradoxes are reflected in our critique of this relationship. The most prominent in terms of implications is that a successful management and leadership development programme – recognized by employees and employers – can generate dissatisfaction with the home organization as a consequence of the purpose of the programme: to increase confidence and enhanced agency.

The study explores the noteworthy factors and sub-factors which are pertinent for the adoption of cloud computing in the Ethiopian Higher Education (EHE) sector. The technology literature herein was based on technology adoption frameworks and theories which were studied in order to identify a set of factors and sub-factors relevant to cloud computing adoption. It resulted in conceptualizing an integrated TOE–DoI framework for cloud computing adoption in higher education at the university in Ethiopia and in developing its reliable measures. Accordingly, a quantitative study was done with a questionnaire survey comprising 500 respondents in connection with 4 factors (technological, organizational, environmental and socio-cultural). Consequently, the cloud computing adoption in Ethiopia was established using factors and concepts adopted from the study. It confirmed that the TOE–DoI approach to higher education in Ethiopia is authenticated. Thus, the four factors’ reliability statistics validated with a Cronbach’s alpha a = 0.739, 0.712, 0.761, 0.841, and Cronbach’s alpha ‘a’ based on standard items a = 0.740, 0.713, 0.762 and 0.842 for technology, organizational, environmental, and socio-cultural factors. This indicates that scaling the four aspects therein suggests profound evidence to determine a cloud computing adoption in EHE with TOE–DoI integration. © 2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","Cloud computing; DoI; Ethiopian Higher Education (EHE); Factors; Integration; TOE","Behavioral research; Cloud computing; Environmental technology; Surveys; Diffusion of innovations; Higher education; Integrated frameworks; Quantitative study; Questionnaire surveys; Sociocultural factors; Sub-saharan africa; Technology adoption; Computation theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073985053

Whereas utilitarian consumption accentuates the achievement of predetermined outcomes typical of cognitive consumer behavior, its hedonic counterpart relates to affective consumer behavior in dealing with the emotive and multisensory aspects of the shopping experience. Consequently, while utilitarian consumption activities appeal to the rationality of customers in inducing their intellectual buy-in of the shopping experience, customers’ corresponding emotional buy-in can only be attained through the presence of hedonic consumption activities. The same can be said for online shopping. Because the online shopping environment is characterized by the existence of an IT-enabled web interface that acts as the focal point of contact between customers and vendors, its design should embed utilitarian and hedonic elements to create a holistic shopping experience. Building on Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT), this study advances a research model that not only delineates between customers’ utilitarian and hedonic expectations for online shopping but also highlights how these expectations can be best served through functional and esthetic performance, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce online shopping experience (i.e., transactional frequency) as a moderator affecting not only how customers form utilitarian and hedonic expectations but also how they evaluate the functional and esthetic performances of e-commerce sites. The model is then empirically validated via an online survey questionnaire administered on a sample of 303 respondents. Theoretical contributions and pragmatic implications to be gleaned from our research model and its subsequent empirical validation are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Esthetic performance; Expectation disconfirmation theory; Hedonic expectations; Transactional frequency; Transactional functionalities; Utilitarian expectations","Electronic commerce; Sales; Surveys; Esthetic performance; Expectation disconfirmation theory; Hedonic expectations; Transactional frequency; Transactional functionalities; Utilitarian expectations; Consumer behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072639663

And given that a SOE has been declared, what are the effects thereof? On the basis of seventy-nine countries all having Western-style constitutions, we find that more terrorist incidents increase the likelihood of a SOE. Interestingly, emergencies are less likely to be declared in election years, supposedly because governments believe them to be unpopular. Once a SOE is declared, it generally leads to substantially more government repression. Finally, countries already under a SOE are more likely to suffer from additional terror attacks, challenging the effectiveness of states of emergency. © The Author(s) 2019.","constitutional emergency provisions; positive constitutional economics; state of emergency; terrorism; état de siege",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071413610

According to adaptive followership theory, this reflects psychological mechanisms that tag dominant individuals as more competent under situations of conflict. Conservatives tend to view the world as dangerous and ridden with intergroup conflict and, hence, have heightened preferences for dominant leaders (the competence explanation). Yet, an alternative mechanism is possible, where people stereotypically associate dominant-looking leaders with conservativism such that conservatives perceive these leaders as more similar to themselves (the similarity explanation). Hence, the effects of dominance might not be a matter of perceived competence but of perceived policy agreement. This article pits these explanations about the underlying psychological mechanisms against each other. Using nationally representative survey experiments, we find support for the competence explanation by demonstrating that right-wing individuals prefer dominant candidates even if they are clearly politically closer to non-dominant candidates. This preference for dominant candidates only fades when the dominant candidates are from entirely different political parties than the right-wing individuals themselves. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Evolutionary leadership theory; Followership psychology; Leader preferences; Political ideology; Political leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068263273

It proposes that evaluating leaders' performance based on the resources available to group members may have improved followers' fitness ancestrally. Accordingly, it predicts that the effect of economic perceptions on vote choice is mediated by leaders' warmth and competence impressions in modern democracies.

We apply a Scandinavian institutionalist approach to examine the translation of corporate social responsibility reporting, an HQ-initiated practice that is transferred to five foreign subsidiaries of a UK-based MNE. Our paper builds from a preliminary framework based on extant research to develop an extended framework of the micro-processes of translation. By theorizing the sequence of the micro-processes undertaken by translators, identifying the conditions under which they occur, and connecting them to the three types of translation, we provide a deep understanding of the micro-foundations of translation when transferring practices from HQ to subsidiaries.

The purpose of this article is to examine whether and how municipal framework conditions matter for sports clubs. Inspired by previous studies, we examine the role of direct and indirect public subsidies as well as facility coverage. The authors conduct analyses on a general level (for all sports) and specifically for five sports (badminton, football, gymnastics, handball and swimming). The differentiation between sports allows us to examine how municipal framework conditions might be associated differently with density and participation across sports. In the statistical analyses, the authors apply data collected among all 98 Danish municipalities. The results show that the municipal levels of direct and indirect subsidies are weakly correlated with both the density of and participation in sports clubs, while stronger correlations can be identified with regard to facility coverage. The analyses for the five sports reveal that the supply of relevant facility types is – with few exceptions – positively correlated with sports club density and participation levels within each sport. Thus, facility coverage seems to play a more important role for sports clubs than the levels of indirect and particularly direct subsidies. © 2019 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand","Municipalities; Public funding; Sports facilities; Sports management; Sports participation; Sports policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063752594

We show that the visual ecology of product packaging is a strong driver of consumer attention independently of consumer goals.

Some argue that this helps citizens “weed out” questionable leaders; others question citizens' ability to distinguish those following the rules from those who do not. To address this question, I build on psychological research showing that the mind possesses a natural ability, a cheater-detection system, enabling the detection of self-interested others who violate social rules. Introducing an experimental protocol from psychology embedded in cross-national surveys, I show that this system also operates when citizens evaluate political leaders, facilitating identification of leaders who violate basic decision-making rules.

While both CSR and co-creation are social and collaborative processes, there is still little research examining whether CSR can boost co-creation. In addition, while previous research has mainly related co-creation to emotional outcomes (e.g., customer affective commitment), limited empirical research has related it to rational (e.g., customer trust) and behavioral outcomes (e.g., customer loyalty). To address these shortcomings in the literature, this paper examines the influence of CSR on customer loyalty, considering the mediating roles of co-creation and customer trust. It also investigates the influence of co-creation on customer trust. The data were collected in Spain in late 2017 using an online survey, and the sample contained 1101 customers of health insurance services brands. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships simultaneously. The results show that CSR influences customer loyalty both directly and indirectly through co-creation and customer trust. However, the indirect impact is the stronger of the two, implying that embracing co-creation activities and developing customer trust can make it easier for CSR practices to enhance customer loyalty. In addition, co-creation has a direct effect on customer trust. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Co-creation; Corporate social responsibility; Customer loyalty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053600156

Design/methodology/approach: An online survey was administered across 83 food firms in Greece, assessing the importance of relationship characteristics of the supply chain by using the best–worst scaling technique. Findings: The most important characteristics relate to the quality of the primary material and the procurement costs and producer prices; these are considered more important by export-oriented food firms compared to non–export-oriented food firms. Characteristics that relate to the relationship between members of the agri-food supply chain and the interorganizational business systems and governance mechanisms are also considered of average importance. Characteristics related to the adoption of differentiation strategies are considered least important. Practical implications: Producers should emphasize the quality and prices of their product as well as establish collaborations with food firms. Food firms need to emphasize interorganizational business systems and governance mechanisms that reduce procurement costs, instead of trying to reduce producer prices.

Design/methodology/approach: Two experiments were conducted, one with 149 auditors and one with 116 chief financial officers (CFOs). Both auditors and CFOs had to indicate the likelihood that they stand up to the other party’s preferred position in a disagreement on the materiality of unrecorded liabilities. The data derived from these experiments were analyzed using hierarchical OLS. Findings: The results indicate that both auditors and CFOs who take their respective negotiation partner in the audit for highly competent are less likely to stand up to them in situations of disagreement. Interestingly, goodwill trust appears to be irrelevant for the negotiation outcome. Practical implications: The findings are highly relevant for regulators, because they inform about the crucial importance of competence trust for the auditing negotiation outcome and thus put the so-called “trust-threat” into perspective.

Springing from a local legend, the thrill-inducing Sourtoe Cocktail has attracted the attention of tourists. The paper reveals insights from this particular case study in order to discuss potential future tourism trends within the Arctic, especially in regard to the development of a sustainable tourism industry. Additionally, it illustrates how local communities can avoid negative effects of “Arctification.” Design/methodology/approach: The case study is deconstructed through Dean MacCannell’s (1976) framework of sight sacralization. The Sourtoe Cocktail is analyzed based on the five stages of the framework, which helps to reveal the various elements at play at the local level. The framework specifically highlights linkages between society and the Sourtoe Cocktail as a product in order to understand how it became a tourist attraction. Findings: The use of MacCannell’s sight sacralization framework reveals the intricate relationship of the Sourtoe Cocktail to both the Arctic and the local folklore of the Klondike Gold Rush. In addition, it is argued that the activity can serve as an example of avoiding “Arctification” processes for northern communities.

This is done through conducting a case study of Katuaq Cultural Centre in Nuuk, Greenland. Combining theories of cultural contact and placemaking, the paper analyses how locals and tourists make use of and experience the centre. The paper then goes on to conduct a broader discussion about how future placemaking in tourism can respond to the emerging demands of cultural Arctic tourists, and to suggest ways to encourage positive interaction on both a local community level and a resident-visitor level. Design/methodology/approach: A series of anthropological research methods were used, including participant observation in the cultural centre itself, and informal and semi-structured interviews with relevant stakeholders. Findings: Concluding that, from multiple perspectives, Katuaq fails to perform as a “centre of culture”, the study offers innovative insights into how cultural centres can be operated more inclusively in the future, as spaces in which members of different cultural groups can achieve positive interaction. It is argued that the future of successful and fulfilling cultural tourism offerings in the Arctic lies at the intersection of tourism and leisure studies. Originality/value: The originality of this paper lies first in its deepening of the academic discussion of cultural centres. Second, and on a broader level, the paper identifies an emerging trend of “community–tourism spaces” as cultural tourism offerings, and provides some insights into the conflicts experienced in these kinds of spaces, as well as some suggestions as to how further research on these spaces should continue. © 2019, Elizabeth Ann Cooper.","Contact zones; Cultural encounters; Cultural Tourism; Local community; Placemaking; Tourism futures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076159989

Design/methodology/approach: The study develops, explores and presents a student-consumer behavioral response model based on students’ experiences at university, exploring the relationship between these attributes with satisfaction and behavioral response [word-of-mouth (WOM)]. Findings: Findings reveal that both branding aspects – brand experience and corporate brand image – follow a rational thought process first before an affective component is then taken into account, resulting in brand promise and loyalty. The study identifies several important cognitive brand image attributes and experiences that guide brand positioning for the Malaysian market, linking these to satisfaction and WOM. Research limitations/implications: It was conducted in a single case-university and future research could replicate this in other schools/institutions. Cross-validation to other private institutions lies outside the scope of this study. Furthermore, although the study has identified specific attributes of university brands, they tend to be seen or interpreted as overall for both brand experiences and corporate brand image attributes because of the reflective nature of the construct, and also they tend to be seen as higher order rather than at individual levels. Further research is needed to analyze these dimensions using a quantitative approach at individual levels and testing the conceptual model as presented in the conceptual model. The study is focused on one Asian market (Malaysian students in X University) chosen for its potential growth in the future. Practical implications: The present study contributes to the identification of specific students’ needs and attributes including courses and modules, reputable schools, the environment (e.g. campus – near to lecturer, international), helpful lecturers and the university location. Addressing the right brand attributes enhance and clarify the positioning aspect of the university brand, while simultaneously addressing the needs and wants of consumers. For example, by understanding the culture – consumer buying behavior within this setting, marketers or school administrators can identify exactly, which behaviors could be changed and by which mechanism i.e. talking to sponsors, and introducing activities to increase visibility/image in Malaysia. Interacting with sponsors can influence them toward sending students to X instead of to other universities in the UK. Originality/value: The study contributes to theoretical knowledge in at least two different ways: by identifying possible corporate brand image attributes and experience that guide brand positioning (for the Malaysian market), and by exploring the relationship between these attributes and satisfaction and behavioral response (WOM) as proposed in the study’s conceptual framework. The study has identified the specific attributes that influence Malaysian students’ early interest in selecting X University via, for example, a recommendation from existing students at X, their sponsors, employers, the courses or modules X offers and location – in London. The study further revealed that corporate brand image attributes of business schools (cognitively and effectively) enhance corporate brand differentiation and positioning (Rauschnabel et al., 2016). © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Brand experience; Corporate branding; Higher education branding; Satisfaction; University brand image; Word-of-mouth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077977919

The wide latitude of the sustainability concept, recognized in multiple contexts, motivated this research aimed at understanding meanings of underlying patterns and logics in the use of the terms ‘sustainability’ and ‘sustainable’. The purpose has been to find evidence that could support the argument of whether the apparent plurality of sustainability could be perhaps more a form of arbitrariness. A systematic search method was used to review a significant body of literature, using objective and subjective analysis, also intending to reduce arbitrariness and subjectivity in the research method. The research analysed the top published articles on sustainability, or sustainable-X (X for types of development), in relation to eight development sectors (Urban, Energy, Transports, Land use, Agriculture, Forest, Ocean, Supply chain) and five perspectives (Business, Corporate, Community, Science, Education). Content analyses was used to explore characteristics of sustainability in almost 1000 academic papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2011 and 2018, and observations were categorized. This paper shares the main results of this research. The complexity of the concept is evident in the results achieved, revealing a significant plurality, but also dispersion in understandings and some arbitrariness in its use. Findings also reveal increasing signs of understanding sustainability and sustainable-X as a complex and integrative concept which cannot be oversimplified, however needs to be made as concrete and actionable as possible. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometric analysis; Content analysis; Plurality; Sustainability; Sustainable development; Systematic research methodology","Land use; Supply chains; Bibliometric analysis; Content analysis; Multiple contexts; Plurality; Subjective analysis; Sustainable practices; Systematic research; Systematic searches; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076568478

In particular, the performance of 45 buildings in this region were measured and quantified in terms of life cycle based carbon footprint, life cycle costs, heat loss rate, number of guests, energy consumption, and area. Buildings were classified into three types: traditional, semi-modern and modern. The statistical analysis included testing for significant differences between such categories by means of ANOVA, and determination of the correlation between the same parameters. Results show a significant difference between the buildings’ total carbon footprint and operation stage carbon footprint while, there is no significant difference between the buildings’ life cycle costs. Traditional buildings have on average the largest carbon footprint and life-cycle cost over the typical building lifespan of 50 years of building lifespan. The ANOVA tests highlight how heat loss rate, size of the building and number of tourists in the hotels are significantly different across the building types. A strong positive correlation is observed between environmental impact, economic impact and energy consumption for the household activities, and a negative correlation with the number of guests and building size. By considering several buildings, this study allows to draw new and more general conclusions about effective sustainability strategies in the whole hotel sector in the Himalayan region. In particular, it shows that reducing impacts in the operation stage should be highly prioritized, focusing on reducing energy consumption and heat loss and shifting to the use of renewable energy sources. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy consumption; Heat loss rate; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Sagarmatha national park; Sustainable building","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Carbon footprint; Costs; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy utilization; Heat losses; Heating; Hotels; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing; National parks; Reducing energy consumption; Sustainability performance; Sustainability strategies; Sustainable building; Use of renewable energies; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076539035

Design/methodology/approach: The authors have tracked the development of four case companies in the nascent electric vehicle market from 2009 to 2018 and have conducted interviews and analyzed the archival data. Findings: The authors propose a typology of business model choices and performance where the four types of business models distinguish themselves by how the companies innovate or imitate the value proposition of the current industry as well as how they innovate or imitate the business model archetype. In accordance with these different business model choices, the actors express different logics behind their new to the product market space business model choice. These logics represent different understandings of technology potential, customer needs as well as potential for value capture and contribute to and limit the translation of emerging technologies into dominant designs in diverse ways.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed a further understanding of reverse auctions through the examination of a longitudinal case study in the mining industry based on grounded theory. Findings: The study indicates that losing a reverse auction is not a death sentence for the current supplier. Four factors influence the potential scenarios: buyer factors, supplier factors, buyer–seller factors and contextual factors. If the overall evaluation favors the current buyer–seller relationship, the supplier can continue the business interaction by full renegotiation or discrete step-by-step reconsideration. Conversely, the buyer–seller relationship would reach a state of dissolution. Originality/value: This manuscript contributes to the understanding of reverse auction, an under-researched theme in organizational buying behavior theory.

First, the multiplexity of relationships in OI settings helps to face the challenges of organisational and cultural changes by triggering trust formation and interaction. Second, redundancy has twofold elements: institutional logics redundancy triggers cultural change challenges which can be overcome through management practices and communications; task redundancy facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration, thus helping to deal with organisational change challenges. Finally, loose coupling in OI settings facilitates social interconnectedness among members through management practices, helping to face organisational and cultural change challenges.

We first explore China-directed activities at the destination such as B2B trade development, product development and marketing training support for tourism operators. The article then compares these activities through social listening to needs and wants of Chinese travelers to Greenland, as expressed in travel blogs on the platform Mafengwo. The concerns voiced by Chinese travelers show how adventure tourism is understood and addressed differently at the destination and by Chinese tourists. By showing how local tourism actors see Chinese tourists and reversely, how Chinese tourists view and negotiate Greenland as a tourist destination, we argue for a more dynamic understanding of Chinese adventure tourism to Greenland to seize changes and opportunities within the Chinese market. Especially in light of new international airports, this conversation, we argue, is of vital importance to work with this market in a sustainable manner.

We use tourism as a lens and bring together perspectives and empirical examples from various disciplines, including international relations, international political economy, tourism studies, education and sustainable development studies, with the aim of broadening the existing knowledge on China–Nordic Arctic relations and encounters. We argue that these tourism encounters not only offer challenges and economic opportunity but also opportunities that go beyond economic gain, including community involvement, use of existing informal skills, development of formal skills and human capital. Additionally, we argue that Chinese tourism to the Nordic Arctic creates incentives to acquire global skills and knowledge necessary to ensure effective self-representation and benefits in an increasingly Asian-centred global economy.

The hypothesis behind this idea is that this strategy could lead to a sustainable pathway to produce these valuable components with potential to reduce the production costs. For the experiments, six oleaginous yeasts were initially cultivated in synthetic media containing glucose or xylose as carbon sources and different carbon to nitrogen ratios in order to identify the top producers. Rhodosporidium toruloides NRRL Y-1091 and Lipomyces starkeyi NRRL Y-1389 produced the highest amount of carotenoids and lipids, respectively. Then, the performance of these two strains when cultivated in wheat straw cellulosic and hemicellulosic hydrolysates was assessed. Detoxification of the cellulosic and hemicellulosic hydrolysates with activated charcoal removed 87.80% and 77.17% of inhibitors, respectively, and significantly improved the performance of the two yeasts. The highest concentration of lipids, 3.99 ± 0.35 g/L, was obtained by cultivating L. starkeyi in washed cellulosic hydrolysate; while the highest production of carotenoids, 24.58 ± 1.88 mg/L, was obtained by cultivating R. toruloides in decolorized cellulosic hydrolysate. Increasing the tolerance of oleaginous yeasts to inhibitors resulting from biomass pretreatment and/or using cost-effective detoxification methods were identified as key parameters for further development of this process at commercial scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carotenoids; Fermentation; Lipids; Oleaginous yeasts; Wheat straw hydrolysate","Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Detoxification; Fermentation; Lipids; Pigments; Straw; Biomass pre treatments; Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio; Carotenoids; Hemicellulosic fractions; Hemicellulosic hydrolysate; Oleaginous yeasts; Rhodosporidium toruloides; Wheat straws; Yeast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076010809

We address this question with a three-fold conceptual framework combining theories on the implied visitor, gender, and science exhibitions, respectively. We analyse to what extent gendered structures are embodied within the exhibition Space Mission. We find that the dominant discourse within the exhibition is one that presents science as technical, fact-based, and individualist, organised through competitive and game-like activities. We argue that these characteristics are associated with masculinity, thereby reproducing the discourse of astrophysics as being within the masculine domain and potentially excluding a large diversity of visitors.

Using experiments in the US and Denmark, we examine effects on an accuracy-based task of two forms of motivated reasoning: partisan identity-based reasoning and reasoning from ideology-based governance preferences (favoring either the public or the private sector). The experiments incorporate a political prime, a health care needs prime (to reduce politicization), and a neutral, no-prime, condition. We find that priming citizens to think politically accentuates the influence of partisan identities and governance preferences on reasoning. In contrast, priming about the need for a service reduces these biases. These findings extend knowledge of motivated reasoning in an accuracy-based task and priming with a no-prime benchmark, and confirm some findings of previous studies.

To fulfill this aim, empirical data is collected through 26 qualitative interviews within the context of a single case study. The Medieval Town of Rhodes (MTR) (Greece) -as a cultural heritage consumption setting- constitutes the case study. The Medieval Rose Festival (MRF), an annual cultural, re-enactment event taking place in the MTR serves as the case’s unit of analysis. The attendees’ views of their MRF-experience were investigated and it was examined whether they were consistent with any of the three generations of the experience economy emphasizing co-creation of experience. The analysis of the data shows that the characteristics of all three generations of the experience economy are found in the CHF services in the MTR. Based on the findings, the CIF model (C: ‘Context-, I: ‘Interactions,’ F: ‘Feelings) was formed. This model illustrates the intertwining, multi-faceted dimensions of the optimal CHF-experience that festival organizers should provide to their customers.

Likewise, externally funded research is no longer a rarity. The question is what such financial and social ties mean for our research practices as organizational ethnographers and for our interactions with and descriptions of the field. The purpose of this paper is to address this question and to develop our understanding and practice of organizational ethnography by expanding the methodological literature on research ethics as well as our tools to evaluate research quality. Design/methodology/approach: Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a multinational pharmaceutical corporation, and building on previous literature on ethics and quality in qualitative research, this paper introduces a reflexive framework for understanding our personal and financial entanglements in the field and the possible impact of such entanglements on our research findings and representation of informants and events. Findings: Drawing on anthropological theory of reciprocity and gift-giving, the paper argues that social and financial entanglements with the field will urge the ethnographer to reciprocate; e.g. by thinking twice about unflattering representations and criticism of those with whom we are entangled. However, the paper further argues that such reflections are an important part of conducting ethically sound ethnographic research. Originality/value: Rather than subscribing to an illusion of independent research, this paper demonstrates how we as organizational ethnographers get entangled with the fields that we study and what implications this might have for our practices and representations of these fields. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethnography; Qualitative research; Reciprocity; Research ethics; Research quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074419023

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on 13 months of ethnographic fieldwork among Danish bouncers and uses the concept of “emotional labour” and related ideas of “interactive service work” to explore how service imperatives play out at political/commercial and organisational levels and how such initiatives are negotiated by bouncers in their work practices. Findings: Until recently, the nocturnal work of bouncers had been relatively unaffected by labour market service paradigms. This is now changing, as policy initiatives and the capitalist service economy colonise ever greater domains of the urban night and the work conducted here. We argue that trends towards professionalisation have landed bouncers in a double-bind situation, in which they are increasingly faced with competing and sometimes contradictory occupational imperatives requiring them both to “front up” effectively to unruly patrons and to project a service-oriented persona. We show how bouncers seek to cope with this precarious position by adopting a variety of strategies, such as resistance, partial acceptance and cultural re-interpretations of service roles. Originality/value: While existing research on nightclub bouncers has primarily focussed on bouncers’ physical regulation of unruly guests, this paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding current policy ambitions to “domesticate” bouncers and shows how attempts to construct bouncers as civilised “service workers” is fraught with paradoxes and ambiguities. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bouncers; Emotional labour; Night-time economy; Professionalization; Service work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071632934

These initiatives range from the provision of smoking cessation programmes to free health screenings in the workplace, going beyond ‘traditional’ occupational health and safety (OHS) requirements. The new standard is the first transnational instrument to specify express requirements for employers in workplace health promotion. It provides an interesting example of transnational new governance, whereby private actors adopt voluntary norms to regulate business in areas traditionally pertaining to public regulators (here, public health). This article analyses the extent to which private actors have acted as norm entrepreneurs in workplace health promotion, and whether the new standard could mark the emergence of ‘corporate health responsibility’ in the workplace. The article starts by analysing existing intergovernmental instruments in workplace health promotion. After highlighting a regulatory gap in traditional governance, the article examines the contribution of private regulators in workplace health promotion. To this end, it analyses the new standard, as well as the recent reporting practice of transnational corporations (TNCs) in workplace health promotion. Although the new standard is a welcome private, regulatory initiative, it also illustrates the orchestration deficit often found in transnational new governance.

Along this line, this article explores how a co-design approach can help retail stores of outdoor products develop consumer communities as a part of their store concept. Such stores may be particularly interesting in relation to consumer communities, because of the consumers’ often passionate relationship to activities related to the products in focus. Two longitudinal case studies of outdoor product stores in Denmark are investigated. The two cases are investigated through interviews, store observations, network meetings, and co-design workshops. Several important findings are discovered: first, in relation to community forms, the article defined three archetypes: business–consumer (BC), consumer–consumer (CC), and a combination of the two (BCCC). Second, in relation to the premises for the creation of communities, the article defined three types: consumer motivation, consumer availability, and consumer homogeneity. Third, in relation to consumer community activities, the article argued that these could be understood as being defined by three elements: the business, the consumers, and the products. Finally, the article defined four overall types of community-initiated activities by distinguishing if they are consumer-initiated or business-initiated and if they have a recreational or goal-oriented purpose. © The Author(s) 2019.","co-design; consumer communities; customer experience; outdoor product stores; retail design; service design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081752118

The LIBOR benchmark is planned to be discontinued by the end of 2021 and superseded by what ISDA calls an adjusted risk-free rate (RFR). ISDA has recently announced that the LIBOR replacement will most likely be constructed from a compounded running average of RFR overnight rates over a period matching the LIBOR tenor. This new backward-looking benchmark is markedly different when compared with LIBOR. It is measurable only at the end of the term in contrast to the forward-looking LIBOR, which is measurable at the start of the term. The RFR provides a simplification because the cash flows and the discount factors may be derived from the same discounting curve, thus avoiding—on a superficial level—any multi-curve complications. We develop a new class of savings account models and derive a novel interest rate system specifically designed to facilitate a high degree of tractability for the pricing of RFR-based fixed-income instruments. The rational form of the savings account models under the risk-neutral measure enables the pricing in closed form of caplets, swaptions and futures written on the backward-looking interest rate benchmark. © 2020 by the authors.

We begin by introducing the papers in the special issue, contextualizing each within one of five broader methodological approaches, and elaborating on the applicability of each to other topics in entrepreneurship research. Next, we use the papers to induce a framework for integrating history into entrepreneurship theory. The framework demonstrates how historical assumptions play a formative role in operationalizing time and context in entrepreneurship research. We then show how variations in these treatments of time and context shape theoretical claims about entrepreneurial opportunities, actions, and processes of change. We conclude by discussing why this may be a particularly opportune time for strategic entrepreneurship research to develop a deeper historical sensibility. Managerial Summary: History can serve as an especially important guide to understanding entrepreneurship during moments of change. We draw on articles from the special issue on “Historical Approaches to Entrepreneurship Research” to illustrate different forms of historical reasoning and research about entrepreneurship. Moreover, we use the articles to develop a framework for understanding how historical context and time shape entrepreneurial opportunities, actions, and processes of change.

To provide new guidelines for effectively using such promotions, this article distinguishes POS activities that provide an incentive to buy by altering perceptions of economic purchase value (e.g., price discount) from those that create a reason to buy by emphasizing product attributes (e.g., in-store advertising). Prior literature intensively analyzes the effectiveness of different POS promotion instruments, but no studies identify conditions in which manufacturers should choose either incentive or reason to buy instruments. Thus, this article aims to identify conditions in which each of the two promotions type is superior with regard to consumers’ choice behavior at the POS. With two incentive-aligned experiments, this article shows that incentive to buy activities is more effective for changing consumers’ minds at the POS when the brand relevance in the category and perceived decision difficulty are low. In contrast, reason to buy activities are more effective when brand relevance and decision difficulty are high. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Brand change; Brand relevance in category; Decision difficulty; Point-of-sale promotions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079703867

The present study traces the reception of ToF in the scholarly literature. It has been much praised, but little used relative to other of March's contributions. The reception has often been superficial and ritual and March's harsher ideas have to some degree been sugarcoated. ToF has inspired work regarding playfulness, improvisation, hypocrisy and not least entrepreneurship. But there is unused potential in ToF.

BAC produces strong performance in the US and internationally, supporting leverage constraint theories. Similarly, we construct the new factor SMAX to isolate lottery demand, which also produces positive returns. Consistent with both leverage and lottery theories contributing to the low-risk effect, we find that BAC is related to margin debt while idiosyncratic risk factors are related to sentiment. © 2019 The Authors","Asset pricing; Leverage constraints; Lottery demand; Margin; Sentiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079349669

This is done by presenting three different theoretical readings, or stories, of the recent proliferation of the term in the industry. The stories are supported by empirical material stemming from document studies, interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in the industry. Safety Management academics and practitioners in the industry generally rely on conceptions derived from Resilience Engineering (RE), which is consequently the perspective used in the first story. Here, we outline the RE-perspective and explore how it might justify the spread of, and apparent need for, resilience, as well as those empirical qualities of operations that the concept purports to refer to. The second story utilizes the concept of organizational bullshit in order to examine some of the ways in which the resilience concept is used to impress and invoke organizational legitimacy, without necessarily having much tangible connection to day-to-day operations. The third reading connects the resilience concept to the rise of neoliberalism, and explores its potential for depoliticizing risk and danger as well as facilitating the responsibilization of offshore workers.

This form of business model innovation requires a profound yet little understood shift in how value is created, delivered, and captured. To address this research gap, our study examines two successful and four unsuccessful cases of this shift. We find that effectiveness in business model innovation hinges on the three process phases that unfold in collaboration with the customers: value proposition definition, value provision design, and value-in-use delivery. We also find that that success is determined by the alignment of specific value creation and value capture activities in each phase: identifying value creation opportunities—agreeing on value distribution in value proposition definition, designing the value offering—deciding on the profit formula in the value provision design, and finally refining value creation processes—regulating incentive structures in the value-in-use delivery. Our process model contributes to the literature and practice on business model innovation by providing a thorough understanding of how alignment of value creation and value capture processes is ensured, whilst paying special attention to their interdependence and the interactions between provider and customer. © 2020 The Authors.

We first show theoretically that a perceived increase in charities’ qualities represents a decrease in the price of charitable output, which could generate both an income and substitution effect on nominal giving. On the one hand positive news about charities’ qualities can increase giving, since donors realize that it is cheaper to generate charitable output. On the other hand positive news can reduce nominal giving because a smaller donation can generate an equal or higher level of charitable output. We then hypothesize and test that such negative income effect may be dominant among image-motivated donors whenever the quality of giving has a social signaling value: donors can “give less, but show that they give smart”. We find that when information is public, 34% of donors trade-off the quality and quantity of their donations. We show that these donors are relatively more motivated by social recognition, and strategically use positive public information to give less. The effect of public information is causal: when information about charities’ qualities is privately received, giving is always increasing in the quality of the news, and bad news has no effect on giving. © 2020","Charitable giving; Income and substitution effects; Information; Laboratory experiment; Quality and giving",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078753320

We tested our model in a field study (N = 107) and two experiments (N = 53 and N = 69). Our findings show that awareness of adverse consequences and entrepreneurial attitude influence the process of sustainable opportunity identification, explaining under which conditions people are more likely to identify business opportunities for sustainable development. Our study thus contributes to the field of sustainable entrepreneurship. © 2020 The Authors.

Market liquidity of these covered bonds is primarily driven by the availability of funding liquidity. Funding liquidity is the main concern because the pass-through funding approach effectively eliminates other types of risks from the investor's perspective.

We discuss how and why history and historical research methods can enrich theoretical explanations of strategy phenomena. In addition, we introduce the notions of “history-informed strategy research,” distinguishing between the dimensions of “history to theory” and “history in theory” and discussing various under-utilized methods that may further work on history-informed strategy research. We then discuss how contemporary research contributes to history-informed research within the strategy field, examine key methodological and empirical challenges associated with such research, and develop an agenda for future research. Managerial Summary: Firms are increasingly making use of their historical past as they reflect on their identities and how these can be used strategically. At the same time, strategy researchers are paying increasing to the use of historical research methods, as well as to how firms use history strategically. We take stock on the role of history in strategy research, outline the key strategic issues that can be informed by a historical way of doing research, discuss the available historical methods, and offer suggestions for future research in the history/strategy intersection. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","firm identity; historical research methods; history-informed strategy research; small-N research; the role of the past","Planning; firm identity; Further works; Historical methods; Historical research; Strategic issues; Strategy research; the role of the past; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076734725

The framework differs from mainstream monological and complexity reducing tendencies within organizational studies in that it argues for an approach that takes in historical, broad, and situational power relations and discourses into consideration when we engage in ethical organizational development. We place the framework within organizational discourse studies (ODS) and discuss how the intersection of Bakhtinian and Foucauldian ideas and concepts, as well as their diverse analytical strategies and focuses, contributes to the field. The combination entails taking a dissensus approach to organizational discursive phenomena that we view as dynamic features that are historically and locally (re)created through battles of unifying (centripetal) and diversifying (centrifugal) force relations. Following similar ideas of Deleuze and Bakhtin, we argue that dialogue and every (organizational) situation is seen as a plurivocal, open-ended, and unique time-space in which subjects have agency to change and transform the power relations and lines of subjectification that they are embedded in. We arrive at a methodological framework that bridges the gulf that often exists between discourse perspectives that tend to either focus on situated or more abstract and historical discursive dimensions. Furthermore, the frame involves an ethics of dispositif and dialogue that insists that organizational discourse scholars engage in organizational discourse activism furthering local change processes. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bakhtin; Discourse; Ethics; Foucault; Organization; Power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076536018

Although global policies are necessary to set the general ambition, local interventions are crucial to realize it. This paper presents a methodological framework aimed at facilitating the understanding and application of circular economy strategies in urban systems, that being a single city, or urban regions. The framework is conceived as a flexible structure that contains a network of potential decisions, describing different convergence and divergence points, and that is meant as a supporting tool for future urban circular economy implementation initiatives. After a literature review and an analysis of specific case studies on urban circular economy implementation, a four-phased methodology is proposed where the territory is explored in order to identify and select initiatives in the areas with greatest potential for circular economy. Actions needed to implement the selected initiatives are finally summarized in a roadmap. Each phase contains recommendations of different tasks to complete and available tools for achieving the expected results. Different approaches to adopt in the application of this methodology are discussed as well, such as production-based vs. consumption-based, and top-down vs. bottom-up. Special emphasis is put on the importance of involving local agents, in order to obtain specific and validated proposals that are adapted to the reality of the territory and the concerns of the stakeholders. Through these comprehensive guidelines, the ultimate goal of this methodology is to help urban systems to foster circular economy principles, and therefore reaffirm their role in addressing and managing global sustainability issues. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Environmental management; Local intervention; Stakeholder engagement; Urban system; Urban transition","Economics; Environmental management; Flexible structures; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Local intervention; Stakeholder engagement; Urban systems; Urban transition; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075881619

Moreover, controlling for the endogeneity of both the sourcing decision and location by using instrument variable and DiD matching approach, the results seem also to suggest that firms that source inputs from high-wage countries benefited from doing so in terms of higher growth of productivity and export intensity.

Accordingly, a large amount of subway-related excavated soil and rock (ESR) are generated and disposed mainly through dumping sites every year, which threatens the natural environment and poses high landslide risks. This study is therefore designed to characterize the generation, composition, flows and potential impacts of ESR in China. The results show that with the promotion of subway and increasing public awareness of recycle ESR, the generation of ESR has increased from 0.2 million m3 in 1965 to 79 million m3 in 2018 with a cumulative CO2 mitigation of 417.2 million tonnes by 2018 and will keep increase in coming decades (e.g., approximately exceed 200 million m3 by 2030). South and East China account for 60% of the total ESR which aligns well with their growing population and economic activities. Besides backfilling and landscaping, ESR were mainly sent to dumping site or unregulated landfill sites, which accounts for 87% of total generation. It was estimated and predicted that the dumping disposal of ESR has cumulatively occupied a land area of 212 ± 25 km2 from 2004 to 2030. Moreover, this study compared the management of ESR between China and developed countries, and recommendations for environmentally sound management of ESR were proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Excavated soil and rock; Flow; Generation; Subway","Construction industry; Economics; Railroads; Soils; Subways; China; Developed countries; Economic activities; Environmentally sound management; Flow; Generation; Natural environments; Subway constructions; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075418111

Though policy coherence for sustainable development ultimately depends on coherence among the SDGs – as progress toward one goal should not hamper progress toward others – synergies and trade-offs are emerging among the metrics (indicators) used to measure progress towards the various targets of the SDGs. In this context, the choice of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita as an indicator for SDG 8 (“Decent Work and Economic Growth”) contradicts the evidence that limitless economic growth is not possible on a planet with finite resources. Here, we highlight how pursuing unconditional GDP growth risks failing to achieve the SDGs overall. We show how, in the European Union, GDP is unrelated to other measures of economic performance such as levels of employment, and relates inversely to indicators of environmental sustainability and broader measures of wellbeing. Pursuing SDG 8 through a continuous increase in GDP will therefore hinder the achievement of environmental goals and goals on reducing inequalities. We propose guidelines for selecting alternative indicators for SDG 8 with the aim of improving coherence among all of the SDGs, as well as between the SDGs and other policy initiatives for sustainability. This will inform a better monitoring of SDG 8 and the definition of post-2030 Agendas for sustainable development. © 2019 The Authors","Beyond-GDP; Circular economy; Decoupling; Economic growth; Sustainability; Wellbeing economy alliance (WEAll)","Biodiversity; Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Planning; Beyond-GDP; Circular economy; Decoupling; Economic growths; Wellbeing; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075378877

When long-term contracts are renegotiated, the rewards for future performance inherent in long-term contracts allow the principal partial control over the implicit incentives. This is because the soft information affects the basis for contract renegotiation. With short-term contracts, the principal has no control over the basis for contract negotiation, and thus long-term contracts generally dominate short-term contracts. With long-term contracts, the principal's control over implicit incentives is characterized in terms of effective contracting on an implicit aggregation of the soft information that arises from predicting (forming expectations of) future performance. We provide sufficient conditions for soft information to have no real incentive effects. In general, implicit incentives not controllable by the principal include fixed effects, such as career concerns driven by labor markets external to the agency. When controllable incentives span the fixed effects of career concerns, the latter have no real effects with regard to total managerial incentives—they would optimally be the same with or without career concerns. Our analysis suggests empirical tests for estimating career concerns that should explicitly incorporate noncontractible information. © CAAA",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073959559

The product has two attributes based on which a consumer's product valuation is determined. The first attribute is customization level, defined by the extent to which consumers are involved in the value chain. The second attribute is delivery lead time which is influenced by the customization level. We consider a market that consists of two segments. Consumers in the first segment highly value customization level and are not as concerned with lead time. In contrast, customers in the second segment are very concerned with lead time and place less importance on customization level. Given such product and market characteristics, the manufacturer must make a choice whether to offer a single customized product or to exploit the benefits of market segmentation by offering two different customized products. Different from most existing work in the product line design literature that neglects the operational aspects attached to production, here we consider the pipeline and safety inventory positioning along the production processes which is interdependent with the customization level and lead time decisions. The model developed provides insights into the conditions under which the manufacturer should opt for the two-product strategy with two different customization levels or the one-product strategy with a single customization level. In particular, we show that considering pipeline inventory and safety stock costs generally leads to lower optimal customization levels, and that the two-product strategy is preferred in most cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Mass customization; Product line design; Quality-based segmentation; Safety stock positioning","Commerce; Computer aided manufacturing; Product design; Sales; Customized products; Leadtime; Mass customization; Product line design; Product strategy; Quality-based segmentation; Safety stock; Safety stock positioning; Stock positioning; Pipelines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072089080

This study finds that competition intensity can be positively or negatively associated with customer accounting (CA) sophistication depending on the extent to which firms tailor their activities and offerings to meet individual customer needs (engage in a particular type of competition labelled ‘customer service competition’). When customer service competition is high we predict there will be a positive relationship between competition intensity and CA sophistication, whereas when customer service competition is low this relationship is negative. Drawing on archival data and survey responses collected from 209 firms, we obtained results that support this hypothesis. The study provides the first empirical evidence of a crossover interaction effect between competition intensity and competition type on MAS design. Moreover, the study extends earlier work on CA by developing and finding empirical evidence supporting a model which provides a more nuanced understanding that explains why certain firms implement sophisticated CA practices while others are content with simpler CA. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Competition intensity; Competition type; Customer accounting; Customer profitability analysis; Customer service competition; Management accounting systems (MAS)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071507845

Control over the resources required for digital innovations is often therefore dispersed among multiple actors.

While existing research suggests various factors that block collective innovation processes, there is still little understanding of how organizations can overcome standstills, and progress to bringing digital innovations to market. The main question addressed in this paper is: How do collective digital innovation initiatives overcome standstills in order to progress in bringing the innovations to market? We offer a novel perspective on the process of developing collective digital innovations based on a longitudinal case study of mobile banking in the Netherlands. Our case shows how parties have collaborated to learn about new opportunities for distributing control and framing solutions, while the actual commercialization of the mobile payment solutions was performed by individual actors. The framework shows how digital innovations emerge through a series of collective innovation processes that build upon each other through control point driven network reconfiguration and reframing. © 2019, The Author(s).","Collective action; Control points; Digital innovation; Framing; Mobile payment; Network mobilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068315655

Specifically, we examine how firms develop strategies to capitalize on the historical and aspirational attributes of national identity. Analyzing the histories of two German multinationals in late colonial India, we find that these firms engaged in “geopolitical jockeying” to delegitimize rival multinationals and position themselves as complementary to the economic and political goals of the host nation. Toward that end they employed “aspirational political practices,” addressing the inherently future-oriented character of nationalism, and invested in the development of political capabilities to gather information and shape perceptions of national contexts. The paper contributes to a more robust conceptualization of nations and nationalism and their role in the formation of international competition and strategy. Managerial Summary: Rising economic nationalism can create political and economic opportunities as well as threats for multinational firms. Through a historical analysis of the emerging strategy of two German companies—Siemens and Bayer—in late colonial India, we show how firms can engage in “geopolitical jockeying” to delegitimize rival multinationals and position themselves as complementary to the economic and political goals of host nations. To do so the companies engaged in “aspirational political practices,” addressing the inherently future or goal-oriented aspects of nations, and created political capabilities designed to both gather intelligence on and shape the nationalist movements.

The recent use of survey experiments, also known as experimental vignettes, suggests that some researchers believe that survey experiments could be used as an alternative to field experiments. In this study we put this notion to the test. We perform a field experiment followed by two survey experiments on ethnic discrimination in recruitment. While the results of our field experiment are consistent with previous evidence on discrimination, one survey experiment concludes no difference between native and immigrant employees while another concludes positive discrimination. These results should invoke caution in researchers wanting to investigate organizational topics using survey experiments. © 2019 European Academy of Management","discrimination; field experiment; Research methods; survey experiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063677320

Current research, however, offers little insight on the processes through which for-profit business organizations introduce social innovations that can profitably create social impact. To understand how social innovations emerge and become sustained in business organizations, we studied a telecom firm in Kenya that successfully extended financial services across the country through a number of mobile banking innovations. Our qualitative analysis revealed the strong role of being embedded in local networks and structures for initiating and implementing social innovations. Strong embeddedness enhanced the pragmatic and ethical imperative for internalizing social issues, but also provided access to diverse resources for implementing and legitimizing social innovations. However, hybridization processes that emphasized social issues introduced organizational tensions by increasing goal diversity and requiring adapting organizational processes and structures. The case shows how developing a mission-driven identity enabled the sustenance of social innovations by providing a meta-narrative that bridged goal diversities and rationalized organizational change. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Base of the Pyramid (BoP); Hybridity; Inclusive business; Social innovation; Social mission; Sustainable business",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052491346

We study the problem faced by service providers in deciding by how much to adjust the capacity of their facility when captive repeat customers choose which facility to join based on their expected sojourn times. The customers’ decision-making process differs from that of service providers in that the former is based on the customers’ experience, whereas the latter is based on the most recent information service providers have regarding demand. Customers use their previous experience and that of their neighbors to update their perceptions of the future average sojourn time, whereas service providers form perceptions of the future arrival rate. We use cellular automata to model the interaction between customers and service providers. We perform simulations to assess the way the customers’ and service providers’ decisions evolve and affect system behavior. Our findings demonstrate that the system we study possesses a certain degree of path dependence. The primary conclusion is that the more conservative service providers are regarding new information, the larger the market share they achieve, and the lower the probability that their facility will shut down. © 2017 The Authors.

This book fills this lacuna by examining the current state of the field and scope for future improvements. Drawing on a wide range of case studies including Brazil, China and Chile, the authors use a comparative approach to examine the policies and programmes being implemented, looking at the existing legal frameworks and regulatory challenges. By showcasing stories of success, as well as barriers to energy efficiency, they highlight the opportunities for increased energy access and efficiency and demonstrate how these opportunities may directly impact on climate change mitigation.

However, understanding how these issues relate to business model components, and how they are connected to surrounding networks and ecosystems, is still an area that requires more attention. In an effort to explain how business model components work together and impact one another in the networks and the wider ecosystems in which businesses exist, a conceptual framework has been developed: The Ecosystem View of Business Model Innovation. This is a holistic and unifying framework, highlighting the flow of connectivity between the internal and external components of a business. In this paper, an illustrative case study provides the foundation for studying this new framework within the context of the global ecosystem for sustainable development. In addition to case study research, action research was applied to gain an in-depth understanding of the interactions between the dynamic components involved. This conceptual framework and supporting illustrative case clarify the types of organizational capabilities, practices and routines that can strengthen both internal value processes and external networks and ecosystems, allowing for knowledge, creativity and innovation to develop. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Business models; Creativity; Dynamic networks; Ecosystem development; Innovation; Sustainable development","Planning; Sustainable development; Business model innovation; Business models; Creativity; Critical success factor; Dynamic network; Ecosystem development; In-depth understanding; Organizational capabilities; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076512800

Immobilised nanoparticles illustrate promising results for scaling up processes, and can be successfully applied for various catalytic processes including waste industrial water treatment. The aim of the study was to design and study an easy and economically efficient green chemistry approach of preparation of macroporous material, with well distributed gold nanoparticles within the wall of cryogel. Ionic cryogels containing chitosan and tetrachloroaurate complex was reduced by 1.1.3.3-tetramethoxypropane, concurrently allowing chemical cross-linking of the polymer. A mechanism of reduction of noble gold complexes within the cryogel walls by tetramethoxypropane is also studied. Properties of the composite cryogels were evaluated using; differential scanning calorimetry, FT-IR, NMR, compression tests, SEM, TEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and low temperature nitrogen adsorption. The catalytic activity of the in-situ synthesised gold nanoparticles was comprehensively studied using a model reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol. Four different concentrations of gold nanoparticles within the cryogel structure were investigated. The turnover number and the turnover frequency parameters for cryogels containing four different concentrations of gold nanoparticles were calculated. The conversion degree of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol for cryogel containing the lowest of gold nanoparticles reached 96.8% at room temperature. The catalytic activity of incorporated gold nanoparticles for 4-nitrophenol conversion did not decline over 14 consequent testing cycles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Catalysis; Cryogel; Gold nanoparticles; Nitrophenol; Tetramethoxypropane","Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Compression testing; Crosslinking; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fiber optic sensors; Gas adsorption; Gold compounds; Gold nanoparticles; Industrial waste treatment; Industrial water treatment; Metal recovery; Phenols; Porous materials; Precious metals; Temperature; Chemical cross-linking; Cryogels; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Green chemistry approaches; Low-temperature nitrogen; Nitrophenols; Tetrachloroaurate complex; Tetramethoxypropane; Metal nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075870944

Steam-based high-temperature heat and power storage is one of the very recent mechanical energy storage technologies introduced. This system stores electricity as heat in a packed bed of rocks and then, co-generates heat and electricity through a conventional Rankine cycle when discharging. This system presents an electricity and heat efficiencies of about 33–35% and 60–65%, meaning an overall efficiency in the range of 93–98%. As the major production of the system is heat, it is only appropriate for countries with district heating systems. As not all countries have heat networks, and according to the fact that, electricity is getting much pricier than heat everywhere, a modification of this technology in order for offering a better electricity efficiency could be highly advantageous. This study proposes the hybridization of a steam-based high-temperature heat and power storage with a small-scale Organic Rankine Cycle (with three different working fluids) to improve its electricity efficiency. The hybrid system is comprehensively analyzed and compared to its conventional design. The results prove the electricity efficiency of 42.6–46.3% is obtained for the hybrid systems which are 24–35% higher than that of the conventional design. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co-generation; District heating; Electricity storage; High-temperature heat and power storage; Organic Rankine cycle","District heating; Energy efficiency; Hybrid systems; Packed beds; Rankine cycle; Co-generation; District heating system; Electricity efficiencies; Electricity storages; Heat and electricity; Heat and power; Mechanical energy storages; Organic Rankine cycles; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075529670

Design/methodology/approach: Data was produced via fieldwork, which included participant observations, conversations and research interviews with staff and managers at a Norwegian nursing home. The paper is inspired by situated learning theories and communities of practice, as the social context emerges as the site where learning and innovation are cultivated. Findings: The nursing home sustains learning at the centre of its enterprise through managers’ and staff’s participation in planned learning situations and thereby highlights a focus on learning in their everyday practices. The conditions for the interplay between planned learning situations and everyday learning workplace practices are identified as the effort to create a joint enterprise and reflexive practices. Social implications: The Global North is ageing. Consequently, there is an increasing need for facilities and adequately trained professionals to support an ageing population. Addressing these challenges will require an increased focus on developing supportive learning environments and furthering our knowledge about the interconnections between learning processes and innovation.

Findings: In line with earlier research, it is confirmed that the type of innovation matters for the access to external finance, but in a more nuanced way than generally portrayed. While incremental innovation activities have little negative effect on the access to external finance, radical innovation activities tend to be penalized by capital markets. This effect appears to be particularly strong for small firms.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the relation between internal and external financing and the degree of innovation in European firms. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical investigation is carried out using a longitudinal data set including 146 large, quoted, European firms over ten years, resulting in 1,460 firm years. Findings: The authors find that only firms in the energy sector will be more innovative when they are profitable. For the sectors of basic materials, manufacture and construction, services, financial and property services, and technology and telecommunications, profitability is negatively related to innovation. External financing in the form of debt reduces the focus on innovation in profitable firms. Research limitations/implications: The authors analyze the findings through the lens of evolutionary economics. The model is not valid for firms in the consumer-goods sector, which indicates a need for adapting the model to each sector. We conclude that the impact of profitability on innovation varies across sectors, with debt financing as a moderating factor.

However, since not all ventures achieve their desired goals through collaboration due to uncertainty, such relationships are sometimes abandoned. This paper investigates the costs of ties that have gone awry in the context of venture capital investments. We conjecture that the adverse perceptions of signals associated with tie discontinuation reduce an investee venture’s valuation in the follow-on round of financing by partially deterring prospective investors, particularly higher-quality ones, from joining the syndicate. By examining large-sample evidence that supports our theory, we suggest that early entrepreneurial ties to venture capitalists may be a double-edged sword, especially in light of the costs of tie discontinuation. © Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084083397

In all specifications, improvements in child nutrition outcomes onset with relatively low levels of light emissions and continue rapidly as nightlight intensity increases before largely leveling off. These nonlinear relationships highlight the value of nightlight as a population agglomeration indicator relative to traditional binary rural-urban indicators.

Drawing on a psychology of power perspective, we argue that narcissistic and hubristic leaders relate to and are covetous of power for fundamentally different reasons. Using the metaphor of intoxication, hubrists are intoxicated with positional power and prior success, but for narcissists, power facilitates self-intoxication and represents a means of maintaining a grandiose self-view. Unbridled hubris and narcissism (i.e. searching for and facilitated by unfettered power) have important ramifications for leadership research and practice. Leadership discourse, preoccupied with and predicated on positive aspects of leadership, should assess these two potent aspects of leadership because misuse of power by hubristic and narcissistic leaders can create conditions for, or directly bring about, destructive and sometimes catastrophic unintended outcomes for organizations and society. © The Author(s) 2019.","Hubris; intoxication of power; intoxication of self; leadership; narcissism; power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079710440

Extant research has underlined the importance of researching and understanding complementarity effects stemming from multiple control forms—i.e., management control systems. In configurations of management controls, a number of control forms work interdependently. In some cases, these interdependencies produce complementarity effects, which previous literature has not captured in full, as synergy effects from interdependencies in configurations are often treated implicitly or tested too reductionistic. Previously used statistical test techniques and formulas have not been fully developed to test performance effects using a configurational fit approach that accounts for complementarity effects from balancing multiple control forms and roles of management accountants (finance functions). In configurations of management control systems, control forms and/or roles of management accountants can be balanced to fit local optima for each control form, and simultaneously fitting the distance, i.e. balance, to other control forms/roles, in which the latter can produce complementarity effects. This balance type of complementarity is a subset of the broader notion of complementarity. To move research forward, new formulas are developed that is suited to testing complementarity effects from balancing management control forms. In this way, the black box of how configurations of control forms produce performance is being opened, yet not completely, to better examine how they collectively produce performance. The developed test formulas are illustrated using survey-data on whether multiple roles of management accountants can affect performance in a complementing manner given the strategy of the company they serve. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Balance; Complementarity; Configuration fit; Management control systems; Test formulas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078807291

This is evidently the case in many real-life projects. Recent literature calls such projects ‘exploratory’, i.e. their goals and the means to attain them are uncertain at the outset. This presents a challenge to traditional project management—working from known means towards known ends—and may explain high rates of project failure. Nonetheless, prescriptions for managing exploratory projects remain situational and fragmented across schools of thought. The aim of this paper is to identify the repertoire of approaches adopted in practice by managers of such projects, and to outline the theoretical underpinnings of exploratory project management. Through the lens of resilience theory, we investigate the approaches adopted by 19 managers of exploratory projects across 14 Danish firms. The paper's contribution is two-fold: First, we present a consistent repertoire of eleven generalizable approaches to managing exploratory projects across a range of industries and project types. Second, outlining shared theoretical underpinnings, we explain the repertoire as preparatory, (pre-action), attemptive (during action) and responsive (post outcome) efforts to achieve resistance to and recoverability from unexpected events. Fundamentally, we argue for shifting focus from ‘what we know’ to ‘how we act’ when faced with exploratory projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Exploratory projects; Project resilience; Uncertainty","Managers; Underpinnings; Exploratory projects; High rate; Project failures; Project resilience; Recoverability; Through the lens; Uncertainty; Unexpected events; Project management; literature review; project assessment; project management; theoretical study; uncertainty analysis; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077722103

Inspired by actor-network theory and its notions of performativity and translation, the paper draws on interview data and documents to reconstruct the process by which the devalued “incurred loss” impairment model was replaced with a more forward-looking “expected loss” approach under IFRS in response to the 2008 financial crisis. These actions comprised of a series of experiments and negotiations, including an unsuccessful effort to establish an “ideal”-type model and the failure of a joint initiative between the IASB and the FASB. Alongside extensive considerations over how to make the approach operational, the influence of the EMH regarding the relationship between loan pricing and initial expectations of credit losses is elucidated. We show how a standard-setting objective grounded in financial economics is translated through a process of approximation as it forges linkages with other matters of concern.

As a consequence, modelling, measuring and monitoring the rate and direction of technological change has been extensively studied. However, there is to-date no scalable, cross-domain, and data source agnostic quantitative indicator for technological change that considers a combinatorial process of invention and technology development. This paper develops and empirically tests a network-based method that takes a combinatorial view of technological development as underlying rationale and provides a quantitative indicator for technological change. Unlike prior research, the proposed method allows for the simultaneous inclusion of multiple and diverse types of data sources, i.e. publications, patents, and projects and it uses text-mining analyses based on co-occurrences of terms over time. The novel method proposed here goes beyond reliance on domain experts building custom sets of taxonomies, is applicable across different technological domains, and permits a temporal analysis of changes across years, industries, and countries.

Such association is also mediated by conflicts (i.e., affective and cognitive), thus resulting in the indirect effects of vertical coopetition on efficiency process innovation through affective and cognitive conflicts. In addition, we hypothesize that the conflict-based indirect effects are contingent on the trust level in the coopetitive relationships. We then empirically test the proposed hypotheses, using survey data collected from two international trade fairs. The results yield support for the positive association between vertical coopetition and efficiency process innovation. The mediating role of affective conflict in the indirect effect of vertical coopetition on efficiency process innovation is also supported, but that of cognitive conflict is not.

Research on B2B practices is growing, but seems marked by fragmentation, inconsistency, and lack of precision among others. Without conceptual consistency and integrity, B2B practice studies are at risk of becoming derailed, compromising the developments of future theory and practice within B2B. In this critical review paper, we therefore seek to create an overview of B2B practice research as perceived through a practice lens. Based on a review of 116 identified practice papers from key B2B journals, we map the topic areas where the practice concept has been applied for investigations, and we also investigate how well the applied practice conceptualization in these papers align with a recognized practice theory conceptualization. We find that the majority of B2B studies align poorly with the three elements of practice: managerial action, habitual behavior, and action-structure duality. Since many of the alignment issues in the review are caused by methodological problems, we propose a series of methodological tools that can provide a more accurate understanding of B2B practices in future research. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","B2B marketing and purchasing; Interorganizational; Managerial action; Practice; Review paper",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075427139

A large proportion of their life cycle impacts derives from emissions embedded in materials. Material reuse has the potential to reduce these embedded impacts, since reused materials often have smaller environmental footprints than primary materials. Institutional settings and the structure of the building sector pose multiple barriers to businesses developing and commercialising products based on reused materials. Although material reuse is claimed to create multidimensional values for several stakeholders, the implications on value creation are still insufficiently understood and considered in decision-making. This study presents a business model developed by a pioneering Scandinavian company offering three building products based on reused materials – windows, wood cladding, and concrete. Using a multi-methods approach, the study investigates and discusses implications of the business model in creating value for the firm, value chain partners, customers, and the environment. Findings indicate the business model has significant potential to ensure that reuse is price-competitive with linear production practices, to offer value for customers and partners in the value chain network, and to provide significant reductions in environmental impacts. If the business model were to be upscaled, implications for value creation at industry and macro-economic level should be further investigated. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Building products; Business modeling; Environmental footprints; Institutional setting; Life cycle impacts; Linear production; Primary materials; Sustainable values; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075390107

We argue that gender diversity in R&D teams can promote innovation efficiency by providing informational and social benefits throughout the innovation process.

Classification of the data identified three overall themes: organisational aspects, individual behaviour and operational tools, which comprise nine sub-categories: three organisational, two behavioural and four operational. The review shows how awareness and knowledge of circular public procurement attributes, based on circular policy and strategy implementation, are essential to conduct circular public procurement. The procurer's beliefs and values are of high relevance in a transformation towards circular public procurement, simply not going for the lowest price, but finding an optimum combination that includes risk, timeliness and cost for the public institution on a life-cycle basis. Eco-labels, standards, life cycle assessments and life cycle costing are core parts of the process.

Since biomass ash does contain enhanced levels of elements that are of potential concern for the environment or human exposure, the performed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), in addition to CO2 savings, takes into account the impact on all non-toxic categories and human toxicity/carcinogenicity during service and second life stages. Results showed that utilization of biomass ash in cement is preferable over landfill for all the non-toxic categories at both cement replacements rates of 20 and 40 wt%. In detail, the reduction of CO2-eq. was found to be between 11 and 26% when biomass ash was blended with cement instead of being landfilled. The hydraulic activity of biomass ashes was found to be a critical parameter in this scenario, as it had impacts on the global warming potential (and all other investigated non-toxic categories), and it is therefore crucial to consider the uncertainty related to this aspect in LCA studies. Cement containing biomass ash performed better, on average, when compared with the reference landfill scenario regarding the impact to human toxicity (carcinogenic) category. Contrary, only the utilization in cement for one particular ash type (from paper sludge combustion) showed a better performance than the reference scenario for the ecotoxicity (ET) category. The impact to human toxicity carcinogenic (HTc) and ecotoxicity (ET) was mainly dominated by the leaching of Cr from landfilling of pure biomass fly ash (reference scenario) and the leaching of Ba, Cu, Cr (VI) and Zn from the second life stage of cement products (i.e., reuse of the crushed cement after service life in road base applications). However, this impact was acceptable when emissions are compared to existing EU landfill directive and regulations on the reuse of secondary materials in construction works. The novel LCA approach performed in this study, which includes impacts of leached contaminants during both the service and second life phase of cement, has shown that the reuse of biomass ash as secondary cementitious materials has a beneficial effect on the majority of the impact categories, with no unacceptable leaching risks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass fly ash; Cement; Leaching; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Second life","Artificial life; Barium compounds; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Chromium compounds; Combustion; Copper compounds; Fly ash; Global warming; Land fill; Leaching; Technetium compounds; Toxicity; Biomass combustion; Cementitious materials; Construction works; Global warming potential; Landfill directive; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Second Life; Secondary materials; Life cycle; Barium Compounds; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Chromium Compounds; Combustion; Copper Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074423961

Through detailed analysis of a single episode from a voice activity in an industrial setting, the study exemplifies various rhetorical strategies used by the line managers and how these strategies may change as discussions proceed. The study also shows that psychological concepts such as openness should not be seen only as stable features of managers, but also as actively enacted in interaction.

We examine how a major oil and gas producer fostered, through its internal corporate venture unit, the development of new technologies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the oilfield services offered by its key providers. The comparative analysis of five innovative projects suggests that two factors were critical for the successful deployment of the proposed technologies: their potential to broaden service providers’ portfolios and the possibility to retain control over the relevant intellectual property. The concurrent presence of these two factors incentivized service providers to deploy the new technologies, aligning their interests with those of the oil major company.

However, more recent research has begun to recognize the limits of this view, which has led to the emergence of a stakeholder-driven, dynamic perspective, in which multiple stakeholders co-create diverse corporate brand meanings. This perspective argues that while managers have influence over the essence of the corporate brand, other stakeholders imprint and share their own interpretations. To better understand the process of corporate brand identity co-creation, we used a case study method with multiple cases, involving five small and medium sized business-to-business (B2B) corporate brands. We specifically chose B2B corporate brands, because they are often built on long-term and close relationships with diverse stakeholders, serving as a solid ground for illustrating the process of co-creation. To obtain the necessary depth of insight, we conducted 37 semi-structured interviews. Our research shows that corporate brand identity co-creation in B2B contexts is an ongoing dynamic process where multiple internal and external stakeholders engage in four different but interrelated performances: communicating; internalizing; contesting; and elucidating. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Co-creation; Corporate brand identity; Multiple case study; Qualitative research; Stakeholder performances",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072182509

Furthermore, we show that the enactment of these cognitive coping tactics coincides with specific strategy-related tasks that prioritize different aspects of an organization’s identity and, therefore, invokes different conceptions of the identity–strategy misalignment.

But, this is only possible if the owning family decides to reveal a family firm image (we want others to know that we are a family business). Family firms largely vary in that regard: While some family firms do strongly emphasize a family firm image, others do so at a lower level or not at all. Accordingly, this study applies mixed methods exploring and testing antecedents of the degree of revealing the family nature of the business in the context of German Mittelstand firms. In study 1, we develop hypotheses for the antecedents of that important managerial decision based on the family business literature as well as interviews with family firm executives. In study 2, we collect data (N = 196) from family firm CEOs to test our hypotheses. Results show that out of eleven antecedents, seven are significantly related to the degree of communicating a family firm image.

In rural regions, tourist attractions are spatially scattered, and poor transport planning translates into lower accessibility for non-driving visitors, yet few sustainable planning tools are available for non-urban tourism contexts. This article seeks to fill this gap by combining advances in transport geography, rural transport, and transport for tourism, and we develop an original algorithm for evaluating sustainable accessibility of tourist attractions within regional rural destinations. Based on the Spatial Network Analysis for Multimodal Urban Transport Systems (SNAMUTS) framework, the use of spatial network measures is presented in a scalable and understandable manner that can be replicated by users with basic mathematical skills and computer software. The applicability of the algorithm is illustrated in the case of West Balaton Region in Hungary.

First, we articulate their temporal differences as differences in temporal structures, defined as the ordering of their past and future time horizons and the temporal depth between those horizons. Second, we show how different combinations of temporal structures lead to different modes of interplay, which we label “punctuated,” “subsumed,” and “sustained.” Third, we show how sustained interplay happens when strategy includes multiple horizons and greater temporal depth, while identity has more defined horizons and a temporal depth spanning the distant past and future. In a sustained mode of interplay, strategy is meaningfully framed by identity, while strategy serves to enact identity. These findings, we argue, have major implications for how organizations can comply with short-term business cycles while addressing long-term concerns. © The Author(s) 2019.","longitudinal study; organizational identity; strategic change; temporal depth; temporal interplay strategy identity; temporal structures; temporality; time horizon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065391174

The findings illustrate how, for different types of tourism companies, experiential value plays varying roles as a mediator between employee–tourist encounter characteristics and tourists’ intentions to recommend an experience as well as their memory of the experience. The most complex relationship identified is for hotels, where experiential value is a significant mediator for the personalized, flexible, and emotional constructs of encounters.

However, studies at the intersection of the three themes in cross-border context are rare and insufficient. The specific questions our review addresses are: how BSRs affect, and are affected by, the working environment; and how both BSR and WE affect supplier’s organisational performance. Following a systematic review protocol, we map the literature covering BSR, WE, and OP and conduct a thematic analysis on the three themes and their relationships. Our review makes two contributions: first it synthesises BSR typologies and groups them into nine major dimensions, namely transaction orientation, relation orientation, operational excellence, partnership form, governance pattern, information exchange mode, cooperative mindset, collaborative attitude, and strategic orientation, and demonstrates a relationship among BSR dimensions, supplier’s working environment, and organisational performance. Second, our findings demonstrate that the working environment is becoming important in cross-border sourcing and supply management but it has been neglected in the BSR literature from almost every disciplinary perspective. We conclude by outlining six research agendas: (1) governance and shared value/shared responsibility creation, (2) capability development and value appropriation, (3) intervention and productivity enhancement, (4) knowledge augmentation, (5) institutional impact and industry condition, and (6) sustainable practices.

This observation leads the paper to make two claims. First, members of these industries fetishize data excess not in order to reduce, but in order to reproduce and stabilize organizational ignorance. Second, in this process of fetishization, organizational ignorance gives rise to forms of collective effervescence similar to that found in totemistic religions. This effervescence allows organizational actors to draw defining lines around that which is marked as awe-inspiring, dangerous and off-limits, namely the sacred. In reviewing organizational ignorance from the perspective of the sacred, this paper proposes that, paradoxically, contemporary forms of data creation allow companies and industries to organize themselves around ignorance as opposed to the promise of knowledge and insight. The paper uses this theoretical proposal in order to outline the contours of an alternative ontology of organizational ignorance, one that understands this phenomenon in terms of excessive presence of data and information. © The Author(s) 2019.","data; excess; ignorance; paradox; sacred",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060953774

Improved outcomes for global supply chain (GSC) partners are anticipated due to the ways that cultural intelligence affects these culturally guided decisions. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on multiple streams of literature and focusing on boundary spanners in GSCs, the authors build a conceptual framework that highlights cultural antecedents of predispositions toward power-based behaviors and explains the moderating role of cultural intelligence of boundary spanners on behaviors performed.

Design/methodology/approach: To estimate network parameters and attribute effects of network tie emergence, this study has used exponential random graph models (ERGMs) on corporate governance data of Danish publicly listed companies. Econometric models are applied to estimate parameter statistics which serve further to explain tendencies of tie emergence. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the process of selection of both supervisory boards and executive directors is interdependent. Also, the study showed that board members are more likely to select popular supervisory board members and top managers who have their expertise gained through multiple companies affiliated with multiple industries. However, these conditions for CEO selection apply only to the extent to which they have their experience gained from multiple companies but not multiple industries. Originality/value: On one hand, this study demonstrates that being a dynamic practitioner who is exposed to diverse corporate environments by being affiliated with different companies belonging to different industries generally increases practitioners visibility in the corporate governance network, and therefore their attractiveness to boards of directors. On the other hand, the results show that the research on board assemblage, nowadays, should be rather observed through the methodology of social network analysis as the method gives an opportunity to understand structures through relations, from which the executive tier should not be exempted as well. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Boards of directors; CEO; Corporate governance; ERGMs; Management; Social network analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074016039

Mostly, the performance gap appears to be synonymous with the energy performance gap. Little attention has been given to other performance aspects that facilities managers recognise as deficient in newly built or renovated buildings like for instance difficulties in operation and maintenance. This study contributes with a typology of performance gaps, with the aim to offer a more nuanced understanding of the term, where the interests of facilities management are in focus. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical data consist of four in-depth interviews, two focus group interviews and three workshops. Except for one workshop, the data collection took place in Denmark. Findings: The study identifies 12 types of performance gaps of which “higher energy consumption” is one. The gaps are interdependent and initiatives to reduce one type of gap can potentially lead to an increase in another. Furthermore, the study finds that the fatal (the most critical) gap is context-specific. Research limitations/implications: The findings of this study imply a need to change the way we previously have discussed the early involvement of the facilities management in design. The study shows that more involvement of FM is not necessarily better. Originality/value: This paper is the first attempt to cover performance gaps of buildings from a holistic viewpoint and from the perspective of FM. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Building performance; Facilities management; Facility management; FM; FM in design; Performance gap",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078175171

These design parameters are determined for each station separately and have remarkable effects on the thermo-economic performance of the system. This paper aims to demonstrate how artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may play an important role in addressing the above-mentioned need and help determine the optimum design parameters for different stations. For this purpose, we developed a thermo-economic model of a 100 MW SPTS with a molten salt storage system for five stations (two stations in India, and one each in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan). A method-based AI is utilized in this paper to ascertain the design parameters of the system. Additionally, a novel hybrid method based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system optimized with a combination of genetic algorithm and teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm (ANFIS-GATLBO) is employed. The input parameters are latitude, longitude, design point DNI and SM, while the annual energy produced, levelized cost of energy and capacity factor are the target variables. The results of the study show that although the annual energy produced by SPTS rises by increasing the SM and decreasing design point DNI, optimum design parameters should be determined by the economic factors. In addition, it was found that the ANFIS-GATLBO method used in this study successfully predicted the targets with a correlation coefficient close to 1. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence; Fuzzy system; Genetic algorithm; Solar power tower system; Teaching learning-based optimization algorithm; Thermo-economic analysis","Artificial intelligence; Economic analysis; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Genetic algorithms; Heat storage; Inference engines; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Solar energy; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Correlation coefficient; Direct normal irradiances; Optimum design parameters; Solar power tower; Teaching-learning-based optimizations; Thermal energy storage systems; Thermo-economic model; Fuzzy inference",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074441203

Existing research on innovation capability building in MNC subsidiaries mainly employs quantitative research designs, comprising large samples of MNC subsidiaries using patent statistics to generate insights at a highly aggregated level of analyses. Accordingly, the existing research fails to capture the micro-level dynamics of learning and innovation capability development over time within individual MNC subsidiaries. To overcome this knowledge gap, we pursue a case study approach in this paper, drawing on qualitative data in order to generate an in-depth analysis of the processes underlying innovation capability building within a single MNC subsidiary. We examine the innovation capability development trajectory of a local Indian subsidiary of a Danish first-tier supplier of wind turbine blades. We adopt an analytical framework based on the literature on innovation capability building in latecomer firms, which is combined with insights from the literature on MNC subsidiary capability evolution. The paper points to the key role of the parent company and internal learning in the subsidiary as the basis for the advanced level of innovation capabilities achieved by the subsidiary, enabling it to become a supplier of innovations to its parent company.

Nine different pork products delivered to retailers were assessed for fourteen midpoint impact categories. Given the higher efficiency of the Danish pork production system, the relatively small impact of transportation, the relatively large contribution of feed production, and the higher yield of crop production in Denmark, Danish pork production could provide a more sustainable pork supply if issues relating to consumer acceptance of superchilled products and cold chain integrity can be addressed. The human edible protein required (HEPR) in feed to produce 1 kg of human edible protein was over 4 for all supply chains, Denmark had the lowest value of 4.17, 4.27 for Australia and 4.56–5.52 for China, largely due to differences in feed conversion efficiencies. The amount of arable land required to produce 1 kg of human edible pork protein ranged from 38 m2 in Denmark, to 44–51 m2 in China and 161 m2 in Australia, due to large differences in crop yields of the feed ingredients. Pork production is therefore a net consumer of human edible protein and HEPR and arable land use are useful metrics by which to assess food supply chains. The life cycle assessment study was undertaken as part of an industry research project into using new superchilling technologies for exporting Danish pork to distant markets as fresh rather than frozen product, and the HEPR and arable land study was undertaken as part of a PhD on the sustainability of agribusiness value chains. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Arable land use; Human edible protein required; Life cycle assessment; Pork production; Super-chilling; Supply chain","Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Efficiency; Food supply; Land use; Meats; Proteins; Supply chains; Thermal processing (foods); Arable land; Comparative assessment; Consumer acceptance; Cooling technology; Human edible protein required; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pork production; Supply chain efficiency; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073726961

This paper focuses on OS practices as success factors and addresses a subset of the survey (1,170 respondents across 74 countries). Findings: OS practices included in the study were found to have high importance for managerial success. OS practices for selection and training of team members show significant correlation with project efficiency but have low adaptation in many organizations. Statistically significant correlations were found to be weaker than expected, indicating that the relation between OS practices (as success factors) and project efficiency (as success criteria) is more complex than expected.

The paper reviews a body of literature on architectural conservation and CE to establish an understanding on the state-of-the-art for both disciplines separately. Then, the relation between thereof is developed through a theoretical discourse. Findings: Both architectural conservation and CE aim at safeguarding value, although they define “value” differently. Fabric-focused conservation and CE favor minimal intervention to material, albeit they arrive at this conclusion from different bases. Consequently, both approaches struggle with the low cost of virgin resource extraction and waste production and the high cost of human labor in contemporary Western societies. CE could be harnessed for building conservation by adopting its vocabulary and methodology, such as lifecycle assessment and material flow analysis. Transitioning toward CE can help increase the preservation of built heritage while redefining what is meant by “heritage” and “waste.” Originality/value: Prior to this paper, there have been no articles addressing the relationship of the concepts explicitly and to this extent.

This is done by investigating how the concept of “risk” is included in various activities in the management accounting and control (MA&C) system. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional analysis of 72 Danish organisations extracted from an alumni database is conducted together with a factor analysis and a partial least squares structural equation modelling approach. Findings: The authors find four latent variables, namely, expectation, attitude, subjective norms, processes and culture, which all have risk activities in MA&C as the depending variable. Attitude seems to be a powerful antecedent, whereas supporting processes and culture play a crucial partial mediator role for the inclusion of risk. Research limitations/implications: The findings add to the understanding of the interrelationships between risk and MA&C. An important caveat is that the authors use soft and self-reported data for the dependent variable and for the various independent variables. Practical implications: The authors propose a dynamic and holistic framework for the analysis of risk. This framework eliminates the limitations found in many prior studies that have neglected the interrelated importance of attitude and supporting processes and culture. The results of this study also provide valuable insights for managers who wish to consider and to explore the interrelations of a number of antecedent risk issues that influence different risk activities in MA&C. Originality/value: This paper is one of the few papers that assess the impact of different risk issues on firms’ different MA&C activities by including the theory of planned behaviour. The potential key role that supporting processes and culture play as partial mediators for risk inclusion is particularly interesting. The research extends prior research by constructing a framework that makes that implementation of RM processes in the MA&C system more effective. It also proposes a validation process that can lessen the model risk possible. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Contingency theory; Culture; ERM; Management accounting and control; PLS-SEM; Risk; Risk model; survey; Theory of planned behaviour",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071645020

Nowadays, there are several commercially available smart farming technologies (SFT), which can record and map different crop needs and also act on these needs. Such technologies are described in this chapter together with their impact on pricing (where available) and economic benefit from their in-field use - either in reduction of input use or yield increases. Findings from this chapter highlight some of the potential benefits and savings from site-specific application of inputs, including fertilizer and pesticides as well as potential benefits from autosteering and section control. All of these technologies are based on SFT, which requires different sensors, mapping technologies and advanced decision support making. A successful product commercialization needs to follow those systems that have proven a high technology readiness level. This chapter provides a conceptual background description regarding innovation and diffusion of SFT. These descriptions demonstrate the complex interdependencies of positively influencing factors with special attention to the involved actors and their interaction sequences. Furthermore, this chapter presents the process timeline for the development and the implementation of two systems that reached the market effectively. Finally, adoption of SFT and precision farming in particular are discussed, along with how SFT can benefit the environment and how SFT can fit into the common global trends. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

A circular economy promotes system innovations that aim to design out waste, increase resource-efficiency, and achieve a better balance between economy, environment and society. Ensuring a successful transition to a circular economy requires the ability to measure and report on progress. Currently, there are three levels of indicators for measuring circular economy: macro (global, national, regional, city), meso (industrial symbiosis, eco-industrial parks), and micro (single firm, product). A detailed understanding of how to measure and document progress towards a circular economy is lacking, especially on a micro level. This is a barrier for both producers who want to provide circular products and services, and for the consumers who want to know how to compare products. This paper helps to open the black box, not by developing a method for measurement, but by categorizing and assessing what is already being done. This paper reviews 30 indicators of a circular economy at the micro level, where the majority of indicators focused on recycling, end-of-life management or remanufacturing, while fewer indicators consider disassembly, lifetime extension, waste management, resource-efficiency or reuse, and the majority of the papers are published in the last few years. There is no commonly accepted way of measuring circular economy in general at the micro level, nor within the different circular economy principles of recycling, remanufacturing etc. As circular economy often is presented as a means to a sustainable development, the alignment between the three dimensions of sustainability and the reviewed indicators is analyzed, which showed that the majority of indicators focus on economic aspects, with environmental and especially social aspects included to a lesser extent. This biased approach to circular economy that favors economic aspects over environmental and social impacts can lead to sub-optimizations when companies apply circular economy and may lead to a narrower approach to sustainability than what has previously been the case. For future research it can be interesting to explore if the same bias exists on meso and macro level, but also to analyze how a more coherent approach can be standardized on micro level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Indicator; Literature review; Micro level; Sustainability","Efficiency; Indicators (instruments); Recycling; Social aspects; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Waste management; Circular economy; End of life managements; Industrial symbiosis; Literature reviews; Micro level; Production and consumption; Products and services; Resource efficiencies; Industrial economics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072697206

The adoption of circular business models at a company level, which is a key element in the transition to a circular economy, has nevertheless been slow. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the barriers that hinder adoption of circular business models to facilitate circumvention of the barriers and a faster uptake. The article presents a multiple-case study of the circular business model innovation process in 12 Danish companies that includes a cross-case analysis across start-ups and incumbents and across different company sizes, industries and customer segments. The article furthermore compares the barriers derived from this empirical work to barriers found in the sustainable innovation literature. The research shows that barriers to circular business model innovation are found at all socio-technical levels and, overall, most barriers are encountered by companies at the organisational level, followed by the value chain level, the employee level and, finally, the market and institutional level. However, there are significant variation between the case companies regarding what barriers are encountered and how many in total. The cross-case analysis shows that factors other than company size, industry and customer segment affect what barriers are encountered. The comparison of empirically derived circular business model innovation barriers from the multiple-case study with barriers compiled from the broader literature on sustainable innovation shows a good correspondence between the two lists. The empirical study, nevertheless, identifies additional barriers not previously reported in the literature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Circular business model innovation; Circular business models; Circular economy; Multiple-case study","Production engineering; Barriers; Business model innovation; Business models; Circular economy; Multiple-case study; Industrial engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072670649

Changes in these customer–supplier interfaces pose specific challenges. The purpose of this study is to investigate how the purchasing function handles the interplay of interface changes. Design/methodology/approach: This study applies a qualitative single case study design. Data are collected through observations and interviews conducted before, during and after a concrete change of interface taking place between a buying firm and its suppliers and customers. Findings: Three main findings are identified to redefine the tasks of the purchasing function. The first concerns the new ways of defining the purchasing tasks. The main issue is to balance tasks with the simultaneous changes influencing other interfaces and relationships. The second is the division and alignment of tasks in intra- and inter-organizational networks with regards to who decides and coordinates what. Third, the inter-connected performance relates to how other actors perform their tasks. For the purchasing function, managing supplier interfaces influences and is influenced by how the firm simultaneously manages its user interface.

While a vibrant and dynamic literature on local content in Africa is emerging, this literature is predominantly informed by economic and political perspectives, and strategic management perspectives are virtually absent. Hence, the aim of the paper is to characterize and develop the strategic management perspective on local content.

Thus, these activities are executed by third-party remanufacturers, but which will lead to the competition between the new and remanufactured products. However, the customers' points to new and remanufactured products are different. For example, customers who are interested in the new product are mainly sensitive to the price, whereas those who prefer the remanufactured product are more sensitive to the quality and reliability. Based on the idea, a differentiation competition between the new and remanufactured products is considered in this paper. We consider the decentralized decisions framework with one manufacturer, one remanufacturer, and one retailer. In this framework, the manufacturer decides the wholesale price of new products, and the remanufacturer determines the warranty period of remanufactured products, and they sell their products to the retailer who decides the retail prices of two products.

However, individuals’ ability to process information varies considerably. This implies that the same item of performance information may be understood differently by different citizens. Drawing on cognitive psychology research, we argue that cognitive differences affect citizens’ ability to interpret performance information and moderate the extent to which performance information affects citizen satisfaction with public services. The argument is tested in a large-scale survey experiment. Our findings provide evidence of a performance information paradox: Those who are better able to interpret performance information do not adjust their satisfaction levels in response to the information. Conversely, those with lesser abilities to interpret and understand performance information are more responsive to it, but their responses are often based on invalid interpretations. © 2018, Copyright © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059905845

The study seeks insights into the top-of-mind issues experienced by the intermediaries in relation to Chinese tourism legislation and policy-making. It generates insights about the concerns (or in some cases the lack thereof) of these intermediaries, regarding Chinese tourism policy and legislation. Some intermediaries are largely oblivious to and unconcerned about tourism legislation, while others have been impelled to undertake substantial changes to their business operations because of it. The Tourism Law of the People’s Republic of China was found to be of little importance. This is especially the case when it is compared with the anti-corruption campaign and its intended or unintended impacts on China outbound tourism. Finally, the study reveals that in addition to official policy and legislation, tourism intermediaries are also affected by unofficial politically motivated decrees issued by the Chinese government. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Approved Destination Status; China outbound tourism; Chinese tourism; tourism intermediary; tourism legislation; tourism policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052139371

This chapter presents in two sections studies on this important, albeit elusive and understudied, concept. The first section looks at the individual artist and outlines research that discloses the motivation for individual creativity and, especially, whether it is amenable to economic incentives. Related are studies on artists’ labour market, which have addressed artists’ supply decisions in respect of their time allocation to creative and other income-earning work. The second section summarizes work dealing with the important questions of whether it is possible to understand what influences creative output and how to encourage it. This includes an overview of recent contributions that have explored how creativity can be stimulated by an increased demand for innovation, whether the institutions of copyrights and property rights can foster creativity, and how specific extraordinary individuals make their discoveries and produce creative output owing to peer effects or emotional factors. © Ruth Towse and Trilce Navarrete Hernández 2020.

As they tailor their strategies to the local context, they have to create product and brand portfolios that match their competences with local needs. A multi-tier strategy with local and/or global brands may provide MNEs with the widest reach into the market and the potential for market leadership. However, it has to be supported with an appropriate combination of global and local resources. Foreign entrants therefore have to develop operational capabilities for the specific context, which requires complementary resources that are typically controlled by local firms. As institutional obstacles and weaknesses of local firms often inhibit the direct acquisitions, foreign investors may pursue unconventional strategies to acquire local resources. We outline the strategies for penetrating local markets through multi-tier branding and the acquisition of local firms, and offer new typologies that describe staged, multiple, indirect, or brownfield acquisitions.

On this basis, we analyse the determinants of two key aspects of entry strategy: location and entry mode in Vietnam. We find that sub-national institutional variables have a significant influence on both dimensions. The availability of scarce resources affects the location of FDI and the likelihood of Greenfield entry.

However, there is little agreement on which institutions matter, and why. This study contributes to filling this gap by analyzing the impact of different dimensions of the newly created institutional framework in East European transition economies on foreign direct investment (FDI). Using a dataset detailing FDI flows from individual market economies to transition ones, we examine the relationship between institutional development and FDI inflow. We find that FDI is positively related to the quality of formal institutions, though an impact from informal institutions can only be shown for the special case of Russia, which has suffered from a gap between the extensiveness and effectiveness of legal reform. Several specific formal institutions are found to influence FDI: private ownership of business, banking sector reform, foreign exchange and trade liberalization, and legal development. Conversely, domestic price liberalization, non-bank financial sector development and competition policy do not enhance FDI. These results point to important complementarities, but also potential conflicts, between policy reform and the interest of multinational firms. © Klaus E. Meyer 2020.

We argue that the weaker are such controls, the more likely such decision makers pursue self-serving motives, and thus shy away from international investment. Listed SOEs’ strategies will thus be more similar to those of wholly privately owned enterprises (POEs) when these controls are more effective. Building on Williamson’s (2000) hierarchy of institutions, we examine how home country institutions exerting normative, regulatory, and governance-related controls affect the comparative internationalization levels of listed SOEs and POEs. Based on a matched sample of 153 majority state owned and 153 wholly privately owned listed firms from 40 different countries, we confirm that, when home country institutions enable effective control, the internationalization strategies of listed SOEs and POEs converge. © Klaus E.

Deleuze was a vitalist Bergsonian, in an intellectual milieu dominated by structuralism and (neo-)Marxism. Guattari was a follower of Lacan, who was abandoning the master’s model to organize group happenings or therapy as theater. On a daily basis, Guattari wrote aphorisms and jotted down provocative bits of text, sending it all by post to Deleuze; who transformed it into coherent texts. Crucial to their cooperation was the pursuit of ‘lines of flight’ – that is, creative or magical tenets. The writing was intentionally ‘transversal’ or full of movement and suggestion. The results were not binaries and oppositions, or an emphasis on definitional stricture, but highlighted new relationships, flows of possibility, and magical rhizomatic connections.

True Storytelling is both a method with seven principles and a mindset to help managers and researchers to work with change. True Storytelling stresses that we need to balance the resources of the Earth, our wellbeing and the economy when we are dealing with change. It is not only a book about how to prevent climate change, it is also a book about how we can navigate through crisis, create less stress and achieve better life in organizations and in society as a whole. You will learn how to create innovative start-ups with a purpose and fund money for sustainable projects and good ideas. The book combines practical cases, interviews with managers and CEOs, theory and philosophy to define the method and to teach the Seven True Storytelling Principles: 1 You yourself must be true and prepare the energy and effort for a sustainable future 2 True storytelling makes spaces that respect the stories already there 3 You must create stories with a clear plot, creating direction and helping people prioritize 4 You must have timing 5 You must be able to help stories on their way and be open to experiment 6 You must consider staging, including scenography and artefacts 7 You must reflect on the stories and how they create value This book is a guide to implementing these core principles to boost leadership practices, create a storytelling culture and staff buy-in. The method is also useful as an analytical tool for organizations, managers and consultants in order to prepare, plan and execute the implementation of strategies. It is valuable reading for researchers and students at master level as well as leaders and consultants in charge of ethical and sustainable changes. 2021 Jens Larsen, David M.

However, we also highlight that such datasets are in need of new approaches, both methodological and epistemological. We proceed by introducing the ML approach to quantitative analysis geared towards optimizing predictive performance, and contrast it with standard practices in econometrics that focus on producing good parameter estimates. The chapter also introduces ML techniques such as out-of-sample model validation and variable selection, as well as regularization procedures. We further illustrate and exemplify these principles by exploring popular ML techniques such as classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and vector space models for natural language processing.

History reveals changes in property rights to ocean resources have been significantly influenced by enforcement costs. Moving the fishery away from the open-access equilibrium towards a larger stock size increases enforcement costs and management benefits. Both historical evidence and logical reasoning demonstrate that enforcement costs are a major determinant of regulatory policy for nonexclusive resources. While feudal law in medieval Europe transferred to the state all property that previously had been common, only “utilized” fisheries were given legal status since “feudal law ignored resources whose definition or enforcement were prohibitively costly”. By the seventeenth century, an extensive treaty network recognized national claims to territorial seas. When in the nineteenth century important fisheries were threatened with depletion, multilateral agreements, such as the North Sea Convention of 1882, were formed to establish and enforce rights on the open seas. © Lee G.

The entrepreneurial process designed and realized within the organization has traditionally been referred to as corporate entrepreneurship. Today, the affirmation of open innovation and the increasing role of employee creativity and initiative as drivers of innovation and entrepreneurship activities in companies are giving rise to a new concept of “crowdventuring.” In particular, exponential organizations, which are able to leverage disruptive technologies to create socioeconomic value, are well positioned in the emerging competitive scenario. Based on a number of internal and external drivers, these organizations can excel within their markets operating as Excelerators, i.e., organizations where people can think and act differently, embrace radical change, and create more sustainable outcomes. This chapter describes the evolution towards crowdventuring and presents the attributes of exponential organizations that act as entrepreneurial accelerators. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business ventures; Collective intelligence; Corporate entrepreneurship; Exponential technologies; Innovation; Organizational climate; Strategic leadership",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133790880

The main objective of the chapter is to analyse how hybridity can lead to innovation. Hybrid organisations are defined by the literature as organisations that combine multiple organisational identities and forms (Battilana and Lee, 2014), multiple institutional logics (Jay, 2013; Battilana and Lee, 2014) or sector principles (Billis, 2010). For the purpose of this chapter we define hybrid organisations as organisations that combine two or more institutional logics. An institutional logic is a socially constructed pattern of cultural symbols and material practices by which individuals and organisations provide meaning to their daily activity (Thornton et al., 2012, p. 2). For organisations, logics may translate into organisational ‘principles’ (Billis, 2010) or rules of the game. In this chapter we use logics and principles as almost interchangeable concepts but for us the overarching phenomenon is logics. The example of hybridity we analyse in this chapter is the growing ‘servitisation’ of public services. Servitisation we understand as a new institutional logic that leads public services to emphasise user-centric innovation approaches. Servitisation and the user-centric logic represent a move towards market sector principles and therefore an increase in sector hybridity. © David Billis and Colin Rochester 2020.

While academia has mostly focused on HRM practices associated with exclusive TM targeting organizational high performers at higher managerial levels, there are reasons why organizations should consider a more inclusive talent management (ITM) approach. They include the growing diversification of organizations and the global workforce caused by demographic changes and mobility across borders, overall talent scarcity and hard to predict market dynamics which all make future talent needs hard to anticipate. Issues such as employee perceptions of organizational justice and fairness are also important. Moreover, existing HRM orthodoxy concerned with investing in the company’s human resource and the wellbeing of employees pushes companies to invest in ITM as a path to a better working environment characterized by openness, trust and overall well-being. Few TM researchers, however, pay sufficient attention to the problems of organizational inequality and social segregation that exclusive TM might occasion and thus disregard how social exclusion and economic inequality continue to characterize many organizations. The ambition of this chapter therefore is to contribute to the development of an inclusive approach to TM. We add to the notion of ITM by bringing in literature on inclusive organizations which is absent from current theoretical development. Building on current conceptualizations in particular by Swailes et al. (2014) and Meyers and Woerkom (2014), we ask: How can literature on organizational inclusion contribute to developing more fair and equal organizations through inclusive TM practices?. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131289198

The process of creating a multifunctional semantic - a competency model - is unfolded. Informed by social system theory the semantic required to enable dialogue in a polycentric network is analysed. The participants are various small and medium-sized enterprises, across many occupations and tasks, different types of educational and training organisations as well as process consultants from various knowledge institutions, labour unions and industrial interest organisations. The model is designed through a participatory process to help this polycentric network of organisations to build competencies for the digitalisation ahead. We argue that design thinking and engaged scholarship in the construction of a multifunctional semantics - such as the competency model - is useful both as a practical method and as a semantic research strategy informed by social system theory. The role played by design thinking when developing the competency model as a multifunctional semantic is concluded and the future research outlined. The research generates knowledge of practical value for networked collaboration in educational ‘ecologies’ as the need increases for stronger links between education, business and research, as well as the involvement of social partners and civil society to increase Europe’s innovation capacity as advised by both the OECD and the EU. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Competency model; Design thinking; Digital transformation; Polycentric networks; Shared semantic reservoir; Structurally coupled systems",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131288600

When the term talent transformed from being a rigid term referring to a specific object, e.g. a coin, in the actual world into an empty signifier referring to multiple objects, e.g. individuality or gifts, in a possible world then talent became something that we could not talk about in a clear and unambiguous way; something that talent management then should have been silent about. The reason is that such an unambiguous and accidental use of the term has led to an arbitrary understanding of talent and subjective bias in talent identification, recruitment, and selection systems and to talent management becoming dysfunctional. Moreover, it has also led to an absence of work identity in talent management that inhibits the individual talent and the talent manager in identifying and talking clearly about the qualification and competencies of the individual as they pertain to the job requirements. This could further enhance subjective bias and reinforce the arbitrary understanding of talent and, in the end, lead to insufficient and ineffective talent management processes. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131283401

Through an in-depth case study, we explore the effects of three different temporary spaces that successfully began to unlock inertia in the case company. We find that the key to successful staging of the circular economy journey is to apply a particular form of flexible and emergent staging where the stagers leverage the opportunities that arise in the uncertain and ever-changing field of opportunities and limitations in relation to the adoption of the new circular economy paradigm. The goal is to take advantage of emergent openings to create temporary spaces where it is possible for actors to experiment outside of the dominant routines and daily tasks to support new sensemaking and the generation of new ideas. © Christian Clausen, Dominique Vinck, Signe Pedersen and Jens Dorland 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129837373

Similar to competitive balance in team sport leagues, three dimensions can be distinguished in F1 racing: (1) race-specific competitive balance, (2) within-season competitive balance and (3) between-season competitive balance. In addition to classical tools and data, some new and F1-specific indicators, such as average lead changes or leading distance, are employed.

The chapter highlights the roles of these firms as connecting nodes between the home and host regions, where regions are characterized by different degrees of technological distance. The chapter uses a Technology Proximity Index, in order to analyze how homogeneous the patents are in terms of technological classes in the home and host regions. The descriptive analysis is based on a sample of 95 acquisitions occurring between 2003 and 2011 and on the investors’ patent portfolio characteristics, such as technology specialization, experience, size and number of collaborative patents. The chapter reveals that investors with stronger knowledge bases and with more diversified and larger patent portfolios are more likely to invest in more technologically distant regions.

In the tourism industry, employee–tourist encounters are particularly important as a lever for experience value creation. However, typically such encounters are based on a service quality logic that is standardised and functional (based on standard quality theory), thus missing considerable opportunities for employee-related experience creation. In this research, we seek to apply big data analytics to identify the types of customer–employee interactions that are the most influential in improving customers’ perceptions of service, value and overall satisfaction. A popular and well-known review website was selected to provide data for a range of hotel rankings (one- to five-stars) and sentiment performance. English language reviews and related variables associated with each review were used. This provided more than a quarter of a million reviews for analysis. A dictionary of terms was created by collecting and compiling synonyms associated with the types of hotel customer–employee interaction based on personalisation, flexibility, co-creation, emotions and knowledge gain/learning. Dictionary terms were also developed for mentions of employees. The process helped us to develop a final list of 639 words. To improve the computational efficiency of the analysis, the data were pre-processed using Python’s Natural Language Toolkit. In order to focus on the most objective and reliable reviews, we reduced the sample to those reviews with a subjectivity level less than or equal to 0.5. Each review was then content-analysed for sentiment and interaction type in order to explore these important relationships statistically. ANOVA tests were applied to examine differences in service quality, satisfaction and value based. The overall assessment of our results appears to suggest that hotel customers are difficult to please; positive employee–customer interactions receive significant positive improvements in customer perceptions of satisfaction, values and service, but customers are extremely sensitive to any problems in employee–customer interactions. Amongst the types of employee interactions, emotional intelligence and co-creation of customer experiences appeared to be the most promising for increasing the three outcome variables, whilst flexibility appeared to be a critical element of employee interactions not to get wrong.

In the current context of volatility in intercultural relations, organizations appear to make a concerted effort to promote the principles of cultural diversity through their brands’ voice (e.g., AirBNB – ‘We Accept’). Whether these campaigns have the desired positive effect remains unclear since heightened exposure to advertising portrayals of cultural diversity may lead to resentment among consumers from cultural majority groups (Johnson and Grier 2011). Our experimental study examines the effects of different MIA appeals framing on perceptions of benefits of multiculturalism and attitudes to intercultural relations by consumers belonging to a market’s cultural majority. We hypothesize that by mobilizing multiple cultural cues to convey a brand’s positive stance towards cultural diversity and inclusiveness, MIA campaigns encourage mental simulations of experiencing multiculturalism, and have a conditioning effect on consumer attitudes towards cultural diversity. Recent studies (Rios and Wynn 2016; Yogeeswaran and Dasgupta 2014) indicate that framing of multiculturalism-related non-visual stimuli affects individuals’ stances on intercultural relations and perceived benefits of multiculturalism. Pro-multiculturalism scenarios framed in concrete versus abstract form can produce unfavorable outcomes among majority group members. We investigated whether consumer responses to MIA reflect the effects of pro-multiculturalism message framing, whereby concrete depictions of cultural diversity elicit lower perceptions of benefits of multiculturalism and higher threat cognitions. We employed a single factor, three-condition design whereby cultural majority (white) participants were exposed to all-white (control) vs. concretely-framed multicultural (depicting a diverse, engaged group) vs. abstractly-framed multicultural (depicting a diverse, non-engaged group) visual appeals. Participants (n = 209) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions – control (n = 69), abstract (n = 64), or concrete framing (n = 76). Dependent variables included perceived benefits of multiculturalism, symbolic and prototypicality threat, and attitudes towards the ad and brand. Findings reveal significant differences in reactions to appeals’ framing. We discuss how examining the effects of multicultural appeals framing on pro-diversity/inclusiveness sentiment can inform MIA designs that promote positive attitudinal and behavioral changes to cultural diversity and intercultural relations. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","Concrete vs abstract message framing; Cosmopolitanism; Multicultural integrated advertising; Perceived benefits of multiculturalism; Threat cognition",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125195973

In addressing these issues, we draw on a course design project in higher education that has been evidence-based developed, formally tested during three summer-school programs, and further refined in the intermediate academic years. Grounded in this work, we propose a course design framework that consists of six temporal phases. These phases are based on what entrepreneurs do and how they behave; and are grounded in the view that entrepreneurship is an every-day practice where individuals meet the world and co-develop opportunities, and pursue these opportunities in an effectual manner. We also we propose a route to implementation through discussions of tested class exercises and homework assignments. Further, we emphasize entrepreneurship as a method, and learning this method requires more than just doing, to which student reflections are a key aspect. We do not argue that this design is the best approach, but that it is practically and theoretically coherent and therefore can address typical barriers to designing, offering, and participating in these types of courses. © William B.

With increasing external pressures, e.g. driven by fast-paced technological innovation and connectivity in the 4th industrial revolution, the organizational tension and complexity is increasing rapidly. This poses challenges concerning how quality management (QM) will be carried out in the future. In order to handle higher complexity and organizational adaptability, QM need to master enabling leadership that creates adaptive spaces, bridging the entrepreneurial and operational systems in organizations. Guiding images such as metaphors have been suggested to support transformative change, but have only received limited research. This paper investigates the role of guiding images as facilitating tool for leading organizational adaptability and contribute to QM leadership practices in the 4th industrial revolution. The paper studied three case organizations where management teams needed to facilitate organizational adaptability in complexity and used a generative image to support the leadership process. The researchers gained access to key meetings to study the processes through observations that were later analyzed with the use of storyboards. The study shows how the enabling leadership processes can be facilitated by guiding images. The guiding images can be generated while managers experience tension and can help support the leadership processes of conflicting and connecting. Three types of guiding images were identified. The paper contributes with practical knowledge about how to support the enabling leadership process with guiding images and contributes to QM by introducing complex adaptive leadership theory. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

The UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) are gaining increasing attention, and there is wide acknowledgement that the challenges ahead, as well as the solutions needed, are often complex. In contrast, the historical strength of Quality Management (QM) lies in situations when the cause-effect relations can be analysed and understood, when technical expertise can provide the answer, where the application of “best practice” is helpful, and where order is a virtue. When dealing with complexity, leaders who tend to impose this kind of command-and-control style will often fail. Success, rather than this, comes from setting the stage, stepping back a bit, allowing patterns to emerge, curiously tracking what takes place, spreading what was learned, and scaling up success. Such a leadership and practice has been referred to as the fourth and called-for “Emergence Paradigm” of QM. The purpose of this paper is to contribute with knowledge about how the Emergence Paradigm of QM comes into play when persuading organisations and the world to take action on the 2030 Agenda. This paper is conceptual but includes experiences from dialogic action research in an emergent process of 60 Swedish authorities getting into collective action on the 2030 Agenda. As a result, the paper highlights how QM may contribute to realising the 2030 Agenda by dynamically combining the strengths of the past QM paradigrms with new practices and mind sets related to complexity and emergence. It also provides new insights that may help when applying QM to take the bold and transformative steps urgently needed to shift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. © 2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Recently, microfabricated devices have shown promise toward improving the oral bioavailability of drugs. The devices provide advances such as unidirectional release, protection of the drug through the stomach and prolonged retention time in the intestine. Until now, there are three main classes of microfabricated devices: patches, wells and containers. In this chapter, we will review the design aspects, choice of materials and fabrication methods of such devices. In addition, the drug loading methods used until now and the lid formation on the cavity of microdevices will also be reviewed, together with a discussion on the in vitro and in vivo investigations carried out so far using the microdevices.

Further steps taken to address the challenges to food security by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the UN include the necessity of expanding the diversity of plants consumed and grown, and increasing within-crop genetic diversity. They advocate that more diversity in our diets will not only improve human health, but also protect environmental quality. Indigenous peoples and small-scale food systems exhibit much agrobiodiversity globally, but here the focus will be on the Americas. Agrobiodiversity refers to the diversity of domesticated, cultivated, and wild plants that thrive in managed systems of cultural landscapes. In the Americas, research on these diverse food systems has shown that they also enhance local biodiversity, promote resource conservation and environmental sustainability, and encourage community-scale. Indigenous peoples in the Americas have been managing local food and fiber systems for millennia; however, these food systems have not been without disruption and change. © Fausto O.

The chapter follows an embedded, single case study design, using semi-structured interviews with key informants and case firms. Empirical evidence from this study challenges part of the BoP literature, as the literature to a high extent emphasizes co-creation and bottom-up innovations with the BoP. However, it is found that co-creation is very difficult to perform within aquaculture in Tanzania due to the significant lack of knowledge and diffusion of aquaculture practice, and also due to the severe constraints faced by small-scale fish farmers. Instead, this study has developed a framework for aquaculture development, referred to as the hub model, to demonstrate how small-scale fish farmers can be integrated into the local value chain through a hub firm which possesses the resources and capabilities of a foreign and a local firm. Meanwhile, our data suggest that due to a lack of legitimacy in Tanzanian aquaculture, there is a slow development and diffusion to a certain extent, where the current BoP literature has not addressed this legitimacy issue when implementing BoP businesses. The fact that co-creation is very context dependent and, despite its prevalence in the literature, has limited relevance in its widest application within important sectors such as agriculture, is a theoretical contribution of this study. From an international business perspective, this study draws attention to the constraints that exclude many farmers from the potential value of export and provides a clear example of how foreign firms contribute eliminating those constraints and increase productivity by transferring resources and capabilities through a local joint venture. Additionally, the constraints identified and solutions suggested in this study have significant managerial implications. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107215540

The authors endeavour a conceptual examination and discussion of the bridges that link both research fields in relation to learning, in an effort to establish an integrated understanding of learning in workplaces. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a scoping review focused on how learning is approached in WPL and HR studies. An analysis of the selected literature reveals fundamental themes and dimensions that further our understanding of learning in the context of work. Findings: Overall, there are three learning dimensions where WPL and HR conceptually interrelate, namely, skills, incentives and work design. The scoping review also shows that HR is output-oriented and looks to learning as capital for enterprises, especially in light of enterprise performance for competence development. WPL centres more upon socio-cultural and practice-based configurations and the individual. It encompasses the human dimension of learning as something enriching the whole of life, including work life. Originality/value: This paper contributes with a unique inquiry into the interrelations between WPL and HR approaches to learning, highlighting the complementarity between WPL theoretical features and HR practices. At the core of our findings is that WPL becomes analytically visible through how HR learning strategies are designed and deployed in the forms of skill development, incentive structures and work design, referring to both workplace structure and cultural features. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Human resources; Learning approaches; Scoping review; Workplace learning",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106267851

Specific atmospheric conditions are required to trigger this phenomenon, which often results in dangerously sized pieces of ice or snow falling off the cables on the bridge deck below. Ice or snow shedding events that have led to bridge closures and insurance claims have been increasingly reported throughout the world in the past two decades. In this paper, a recently developed passive solution in the form of a steel wire mesh, which can be effectively used on new as well as on existing bridges, is introduced. Despite having a higher drag coefficient than the conventional helically filleted cable surface, the wire mesh is capable of retaining the ice on the surface of the cable for an extended time. This leads to prolonged ice melting and fragmentation of the ice before or during shedding, thus achieving a substantial risk reduction. © 2020 IABSE Congress, Christchurch 2020: Resilient Technologies for Sustainable Infrastructure - Proceedings.

Nevertheless, utilization of mass customization as a strategy might have potentials in the construction industry. This research is a multi-case study of 11 companies in the construction industry focusing on how the cases apply the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization 1) solution space development, 2) choice navigation and 3) robust process design, and how their improvement initiatives effect performance, and how the cases plan to develop the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization. The outset is an analysis of project phases and critical success factors characterizing the cases followed by an analysis of how the cases apply and plan to develop the nine tools and approaches supporting the development of the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization. The data are collected through interview as a two-way communicative approach providing holistic and in-depth explanations of the 18 variables of the analysis. The results are that all 11 cases aim at increasing all nine tools and approaches, which strengthen the utilization of the three fundamental capabilities of mass customization in the sense of improving the productivity.

Lack of performance history and novel technologies combine to create liabilities that they must overcome to gain legitimacy in the eyes of stakeholders and gain access especially financial resources. This makes strategies to increase legitimacy and reduce the likelihood for failure among technology-based start-ups (TBS) a persistent pursuit in entrepreneurship research with strong implications for practice. Forging alliances with important stakeholders show relevance and indicate legitimacy. Using data from 173 start-ups working with energy efficient technologies, this analysis found evidence to suggest that forging alliances and the public declaration of these can influence legitimacy among TBS. The influence however, it not straight forward and has implication for both research and practice.

The focus is on its main principles in its current stage and how the technology may create value in certain use cases. Being one of the most common use cases benefitting from the main principles of blockchain technology, it is analysed how capital raised through initial coin offerings and the investors' return on their invested capital should be classified according to the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017. More specifically, emphasis is placed on classification of capital raised through the issuing of utility tokens, debt tokens, and equity tokens as well as the classification of return on investments in such tokens. Among other things, it is concluded: 1) that capital raised through the issuing of utility tokens in some initial coin offerings may be subject to a shared taxing right; 2) and that Article 21 of the OECD Model Tax Convention 2017 may, to a greater extent, be applicable with regards to the classification of the investors' return on investment in tokens compared to return on more ‘traditional' hybrid financial instruments. Against this background, the fundamental principles of legal certainty and neutrality are discussed. It is also recommended that policymakers provide guidance on the classification of capital raised through initial coin offerings and the investors' return on their invested capital. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.

Design/methodology/approach: This study used a cross-sectional research design. Data was collected from 232 women entrepreneurs operating in Kampala’s two biggest markets. The data were analyzed to test the mediation effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between entrepreneurial competences and firm growth; a Sobel test and bootstrap estimation were analytical approaches that were used. Findings: This paper argues that for female entrepreneurs, the venture growth process is not simply dependent on inimitable resources such as competences, as these are first not readily available to female entrepreneurs and second, only provide a temporary competitive advantage. Rather, venture growth also involves the ability to continuously identify and exploit knowledge resources through an absorptive capacity that may be limited by the sociocultural context within which the female entrepreneur operates in sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value: The novelty of this research resides in support for the mediating role of the ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends. This study shows that female entrepreneurs use externally generated knowledge as a mechanism to grow their firms and this is impacted by the sociocultural context within which they operate. The study further improves the understanding of the resource-based view by suggesting that a black box exists in the relationship between resources and performance. It is shown that the possession of one resource facilitates the acquisition of other resources and proposes that the role of resources continuously unfolds as a firm develops. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absorptive capacity; Entrepreneurial competencies; Female entrepreneurship; Growth; Sub-Saharan Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102205014

(2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work is lacking. To help fill this gap, this study aims to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated in the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves a cleaning crew's challenge. Design/methodology/approach: Participatory observation was the qualitative methodology used to conduct this study. The cleaning team understood they were the research participants under investigation in the food plant. Participatory observation favored an efficient and flexible process for the cleaners to demonstrate their experiential knowledge while the researchers documented the cleaners' routine cleaning practices and challenges. Directly observing and analyzing the cleaners' everyday creative acts inferred face validity. This ensured to a degree that the study was effective at exploring everyday creativity. Findings: Following Finke's Geneplore model in creative cognition (Birdsell, 2019), the consultant shifted between cycles of analogical reasoning in the generative process with exploratory processes to test hypothesis and tailor his thinking. Through this process, the consultant leveraged everyday creativity to develop a small innovation of foaming a non-foaming soap. The foaming process changed the soap's chemistry, enabling the cleaners to remove the spot quickly, accelerating the cleaning process. Research limitations/implications: According to Mumford et al. (2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work are lacking. In this study, we aim to show how metaphorical creativity was integrated into the realm of everyday creativity to form a new soap that solves an industrial cleaning crew's challenge. To fully understand the variety of metaphorical creativity more qualitative cases need to be analyzed and qualitative research is needed to grasp the scale of metaphorical creativity in everyday creativity. Practical implications: The findings gleaned from this study are beneficial to help organizations solve problems. Viewing problems metaphorically in everyday creativity involves unconventional thinking. When confronted with a challenge that seems impossible to solve, employees should approach the problem from a different angle. Sometimes, a small, innovative act can solve problems that appear hopeless, similar to the Columbus Principle. After all, a challenge is only simple once you know how to pull it off – the triumph is having the courage to try something new and succeeding. With practice, metaphorical creativity is a skill that one can develop. This could e.g. be viewing old problems through a new lens. Applying a new approach may reveal an unconventional solution. Originality/value: According to Mumford et al. (2018), case studies illustrating creative-problem solving at work are lacking.

These are (1) semantic standardisation, (2) cognitive technologies and (3) smart contracts and blockchain. We discuss that each of these seem to have their merit for contract management and potentially can contribute to contract management in more complex and dynamic sourcing arrangements.

Through a storytelling “futures workshop” concept the need for a new story about the industry was acknowledged and initiated to make choice of a non-status quo future. In this process, we utilized PAR to create new beliefs about being part of sustainable food production. The participants decided to co-author a counternarrative to the dominant political economy narrative about agriculture in Denmark. First, we contribute an understanding of the difference between PAR and AR. PAR develops collective storytelling approach, whereas AR stays with the intervenor’s narrative. Our second contribution is to overcome several short-comings of the triplebottom line approach. In particular, we developed metrics and objectives to flex out the people and planet aspects, rather than the usual reductions of these to profit metrics. © 2020, Organization Development Institute.

In its preliminary ruling, the European Court of Justice establishes authoritatively the interpretation or validity of the relevant EU legislation. When EU law plays a role in commercial arbitration it may be very useful for arbitration tribunals to have access to the preliminary reference procedure. However, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, only 'a court or tribunal of a Member State' can make a preliminary reference and this notion does not include commercial arbitration tribunals. In order to give arbitration tribunals access to the preliminary reference procedure Denmark has introduced a scheme which allows them to ask the ordinary Danish courts to make preliminary references on behalf of the arbitration tribunal.

Findings: A strategic alignment framework comprising human, information technology, organization, performance, process and strategic practices are used as a basis to identify 15 types of alignment capabilities and their inter-dependent variables fostering the value creation of big data. The alignment framework is accompanied by seven propositions to obtain alignment of big data in service processes. Research limitations/implications: The study demonstrates empirical anchoring of how alignment capabilities affect a company’s ability to create value from big data as identified in a service supply chain. Practical implications: Service supply chains and big data are complex matters. Therefore, understanding how alignment affects a company’s ability to create value of big data may help the company to overcome challenges of big data.

In Bunbury, Western Australia, the Dolphin Discovery Centre (DDC) conducts a foodprovision program where bottlenose dolphins (N = 22; between 2000 and 2018) are offered food rewards to encourage their visitation at a beach in front of the DDC. We used historical records on individual beach visits by adult female dolphins collected by the DDC from 2000 to 2018 to develop generalized mixed effects models (GLMM) to test whether the frequency of beach visitation was influenced by their reproductive status (pregnant, lactating, nonreproductive) or climatic events (El Niño-Southern Oscillation phases) that could affect prey availability. We also quantified the behavioral budget of dolphins during food-provisioning sessions and documented intra- and interspecific aggressive behaviors using individual focal follows collected in 2017–2018. Provisioned females spend most of the time resting within the interaction area (66.3%) and aggressive interactions arise as a consequence of dominance behavior over food access. Visitation rates were most influenced by reproductive status with pregnant and lactating females visiting the provisioning area more frequently (z = 2.085, p = 0.037 and z = 2.437, p = 0.014, respectively). Females that frequently visit the provisioning area expose their dependent calves to regular human interactions at an early age when they are more susceptible to behavioral conditioning. Such experiences could cause the loss of awareness towards humans and promote maladaptive behaviors such as begging that increase risk of entanglement in fishing gear, boat strikes, and propeller injuries.

Therefore minimizing food waste at the household level remains an important component of the food chain responsibility. This study explores the problem of food waste in Mauritius through an understanding of households' attitudes toward food waste and their motivations and barriers to food waste recycling. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a grounded theory approach to identify thematic categories that represent participants' attitudes toward food waste and the barriers they face to food waste reduction. We used a purposive sampling technique to guide the selection of participants. Interviews were conducted with 14 participants: three experts in food waste and 11 households. The data were analyzed using the tools of grounded theory. Findings: Participants' expressed views on food waste included (1) guilt toward wasting food; (2) (lack of) environmental awareness; (3) financial considerations and (4) exemption from responsibility. The findings also led to the development of four themes that defined the barriers participants face to recycling food waste: (1) lack of awareness; (2) space limitations on recycling methods; (3) inadequate policy and (4) lack of time/priority. Practical implications: Addressing the problem of food waste requires a holistic approach that takes into account households' attitudes to food waste, their motivation and barriers to food waste recycling as well as the regulatory and institutional framework governing food waste management in Mauritius. Policymakers should try to improve households' knowledge about food waste through educational campaigns. The authorities can provide different types of bins to households freely to facilitate the sorting out of waste and impose a fee for food waste generated beyond a certain limit or provide subsidies to them for handling food waste properly. Originality/value: The management of food waste is particularly challenging for small islands developing states because of their unique characteristics of smallness, limited resources and environmental vulnerability. Appropriate interventions to reduce household food waste require place-based and geographically sensitive analyses that take into account the specificities of local food and waste management systems and cultural norms with respect to food. However, there is not only a paucity of research on household food waste, but most studies have been carried out in nonisland economies. The study contributes to the limited research on household food waste in small islands. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food waste; Households; Motivation","adult; article; attitude; awareness; clinical article; economic aspect; female; food waste; grounded theory; guilt; household; human; human experiment; human tissue; interview; male; Mauritius; motivation; recycling; responsibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099409469

Historically, sales managers and researchers emphasized extrinsic over intrinsic motivation assuming that in combination they cannot coexist (DeCharms 1968; Deci 1971; Deci and Ryan 1985; Lepper et al. 1973). However, research in psychology (e.g. Amabile et al. 1994; Amabile 1993) suggests that certain types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be used in combination to enhance work outcomes. So far, however, there is little evidence for Amabile’s assumption that intrinsic and extrinsic motivation can be used simultaneously, and the results of previous research have been inconclusive (Kanfer et al. 2017; Khusainova et al. 2018). Drawing on self-determination theory (Deci 1975; Deci and Ryan 1980, 1985), we empirically examine the relationship between the combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations and three key performance outcomes: output performance, behavioral performance, and work engagement. We collect data from a cross-sectional sample of (196) industrial salespeople. To test the proposed hypothesis we use the advanced technique of polynomial regression with response surface analysis (Shanock et al. 2010; Ahearne et al. 2013). The study findings reveal that salesperson intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations have a positive combined effect on output performance and work engagement. Congruence was shown to be important in most combinations of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations as they relate to output performance and work engagement. Finally, results indicate that the combinations of intrinsic with extrinsic motivational orientations lead to higher levels of output performance and work engagement as opposed to the combinations of only intrinsic or only extrinsic motivational orientations. This study offers several vital managerial implications. Sales managers are advised to carefully utilize both intrinsic and extrinsic motivators to increase salesperson performance and work engagement. It is important that sales managers attempt to utilize a more balanced approach without overemphasizing any one single type of motivation. © 2020, The Academy of Marketing Science.","(In)congruence analysis; Cognitive and affective motivation; Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation; Polynomial regression with response surface analysis; Sales motivation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099289565

We use a temporal lens to study the potential of advanced technology to influence collaborative creativity. Prior studies have found that inner time and social time are critical for collaborative creativity. To creatively and purposefully contribute to collaboration, inner time-a temporal capacity to reflect on actions, meaning, and consequences over time-is required. Also necessary is social time-the time spent with others-to practice giving and taking of multivocal ideas and perspectives. What has not been well scrutinized in the organization and management literature is whether advanced technology might suppress both inner time and social time. In this paper, we advance futureoriented conjectures on the potential role of advanced technology on such temporal capacity. Included in our projections is a futuristic doomsday in which advanced technology has extinguished inner time and social time and hence curtailed collaborative creativity.

The findings support previous claims regarding the need for a profit driven nature, regardless of business profit orientation, as well as generating diverse income streams to cover operational costs.

The research question is how involvement and engagement in FIS is reflecting the completeness and insight of management in the operational organization. This paper is based on qualititative, interpretivistic and socially-inspired case studies in Danish industry. The method is based on information systems research traditions. This study suggests a FIS Management framework to improve understanding of FIS as intermediator between (top) management, end-users (employees) and enterprise systems (ES). Using Business Process Lifecycle Management this paper develops a framework to clarify roles for transition between the feral and the enterprise level of technology emphasizing management responsibilities and shortcomings. Research, so far, has mainly focused on FIS from an artifactual or phenomenological viewpoint. This study's value is viewing FIS as driving factor in corporate management processes and intermediation in (mis)alignment between the management's understanding of technology and the end-users perception of technology.

Recent research in entrepreneurship education suggests that the educational sector plays an important role as an actor in an entrepreneurship ecosystem. The ecosystem's five elements are students, educators, educational institution, community and external organisations (often a company). Furthermore, the entrepreneurship education ecosystem is characterised by the individual participants mutually influencing each other through dialogic relationships. Working with innovation and entrepreneurship processes in education can pose a challenge for educators, who are used to thinking within the traditional learning environment with educators and students as the main participants. There can be a discrepancy between the perception of an innovation and entrepreneurship project within the external organisation and within the educational institution. In the latter, the project will be viewed through the point of view of the different disciplines, in which any education is divided, whereas the project, in the former, will be seen more as a whole. Often projects are part of the teaching in a single discipline only, and the students will have other disciplines at the same time - which are then seen as unrelated. Working with the project in all disciplines will allow students and educators to view the project as a whole, thus mirroring the more holistic view of the external organisation. Our paper will present a didactic approach as well a practical tool for how to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration as a method to support the educational institution in becoming an important and equal actor in the ecosystem as well as enhancing the transversal skills of the students. This would be of interest to educators who are in the process of planning and executing innovation and entrepreneurship projects involving several educational disciplines. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

Literature on entrepreneurial identity development is regularly linked to either identity theory or social identity theory. Identity theory relates to the notion of roles that an individual assumes. In entrepreneurship education students are in a transition period between roles, i.e. role transformation from student to entrepreneur and/or professional. Furthermore, existing literature suggests how students can both develop and have an entrepreneurial identity while not necessarily starting up a business. Identity formation is further supported by the narrative the student creates with regard to their selves as the student engages in a form of dialogue with themselves but also with others as part of the entrepreneurial learning process. Upon this backdrop, this study proposes the following problem statement: ""How can student self-insights assist with their entrepreneurial identity development journey?"" To tackle this question, we analysed 51 student video clips after students had participated in an entrepreneurship course. Our findings support the theory of identity formation relating to the concept of roles: The self-reflective video clip as a form of assessment creates a means by which the students both raise their self-awareness and, crucially, construct their entrepreneurial identities. The results underline that students' entrepreneurial identities are formed in a social process and by what happens both inside and beyond the entrepreneurial classroom. These findings will be of interest to researchers and educators as it moves beyond a pure skills or competency approach of understanding the impact of entrepreneurship education. © 2020 Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited.

The guiding research question reverberates around how organizational learning (OL) and corporate entrepreneurship (CE) can promote and facilitate sustainability practices in organizations. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses knowledge from OL and CE theories representing tools to think with for an exploration of how to actualize sustainability practices in organizations. Findings: This paper construes and presents a four-phase multilevel conceptual model for the analysis and creation of sustainability practices using insights from OL and CE. OL contributes with vital parts for creating sustainability practices in organizations delineated by continuous feedback and feedforward loops on individual, group, organizational and societal levels. CE prompts essential process and concrete working elements accentuating the importance of acquiring sustainability in all phases of the change process. Research limitations/implications: The outlined conceptual model is general and need to address the deeper complexities and context dependencies of sustainable practice in organizations in a more elaborate form. Thus, the proposed model calls for empirical scrutiny and further theoretical development. Originality/value: Derived from two interrelated fields of research, this paper contributes with a novel model addressing how sustainability practices can be conceptualized and facilitated in organizations.

It proposes a formal modelling approach, enhancing the utilization of changeability of a manufacturing system given a set of changes in a product. Design/methodology/approach: To develop the proposed modelling approach, a design science research method is used to iteratively frame an issue, develop a solution and evaluate it in a relevant environment. Evaluation is carried out through a case study. Findings: A stepwise method is introduced, facilitating the creation of a model describing the relations between product characteristics within a product family and the changeability of a manufacturing system. Limitations of each manufacturing system module are evaluated to determine permittable changes in the product domain. This establishes clear relations between product attributes and manufacturing capabilities. Through this, users receive feedback on which parts of the manufacturing system must change, depending on changes in product attributes. Research limitations/implications: Testing has been carried out in an academic learning factory setting. Products and processes are thus less complicated than an industrial setting. The system used for validation is highly modular by design. Practical implications: The proposed approach could be used during product development, when determining characteristics and variety of new products, evaluating the consequences of changing the solution space. This implies a shorter time-to-market and lower product costs. Social implications: Faster product development and shorter time-to-market would give manufacturers increased agility to track market needs, and ultimately lead to greater fulfilment of customer requirements. Originality/value: The current body of literature focus on modelling either products or manufacturing systems. Little literature addresses both, but does not touch on identifying changes within parts of the manufacturing system, nor supports the high changeability proposed in this research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Changeability; Changeable manufacturing; Industry 4.0; Manufacturing system; Process modelling; Product modelling; Qualitative; Reconfigurable manufacturing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097192764

Several studies linked individual personality traits and creativity, yet in most cases, the literature provides contradictory insights. In this study, we quasi-replicate prior studies using a new sample to assess the reliability of previous research. Furthermore, we explore the topic in greater detail, as we also study the relationship of creativity with personality facets, a more fine-grained alternative. Methodology/Approach: The study uses a survey-based sample of students from Denmark. To measure personality traits and facets, we asked respondents to fill 44 items Big Five Personality Inventory. We measured creativity using three items from the HEXACO-60 personality inventory. The data were analyzed using generalized least squares models with gender as a control. Findings: In line with the previous literature, our research showed that Openness to Experience is positively related to creativity. We found similar, yet statistically weaker evidence for the relationship of Extraversion and creativity. In contrast to most of the previous findings, we also reported a negative relationship between Conscientiousness and creativity. Research Limitation/Implication: Our research contributes to the topic of the relationship between personality traits and creativity. Some of the relationships fall into the area where the literature is not coherent. We propose that the explanation may stem from the too broad formulation of personality traits, and we partially show that using personality facets. For this reason, future research needs to go into detail of individual personality traits.

The technical knowledge commons encompass the sum of practical experiences, professional literature, techniques and tested routines in different technical areas that professionals are expected to be familiar with. Due to its role in institutionalizing conceptions of proper conduct and professional practice, the technical knowledge commons have been met by industry criticism, being seen as 'backdoor' regulation that stifles innovation and constitutes a barrier to the globalization of labour and building materials. We illustrate how the technical knowledge commons is singled out as a battleground for struggles to redefine the governance of the industry. Using the concepts of institutional interlocks and meta-routines, it is analysed how actors are connected to the knowledge commons and contribute to a distributed maintenance of contested institutionalized practices. On this basis, we discuss how existing interlocks have been challenged and lost legitimacy in the face of the industry's deregulation and globalization, and how a new form of collective agency has arisen as professional associations have rallied in an attempt to establish new and legitimate governance structures to maintain the common good. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.","Collective action; Deregulation; Interlocks; Knowledge commons; Routines","Construction industry; Project management; Public policy; Collective action; Distributed maintenance; Governance structures; New forms; Practical experience; Professional associations; Professional practices; Professional aspects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097000963

However, its application by the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry is limited due to lack of available and reliable information. In order to overcome this challenge, researchers have proposed transferring information from operation of existing buildings to the design of new buildings. By using structured analysis methods and specifically, data flow diagram techniques, this study aims to explore how can data from existing social housing building projects with regard to cost drivers of LCC inform the design of new projects. To support the analysis, a social housing project in a Danish architecture firm is used as the case study, and data are gathered through physical artefacts and five semi-structured interviews in both the architect and building client organisation. The results indicate the availability of operational data in several of the processes in the data flow diagram of the case project. The discussion focusses on different ways that O&M data from existing buildings that are provided to the design team through a requirements' report when a new project is published, can be effectively used to identify cost drivers of LCC and inform the design of new projects. The consideration of cost drivers of LCC in early design stages will contribute to designing more economically sustainable constructions that are easy and affordable to operate and maintain. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.","Cost drivers; Life cycle cost (LCC); Social housing; Structured analysis","Availability; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Data flow analysis; Data flow graphs; Data transfer; Decision making; Flowcharting; Housing; Life cycle; Office buildings; Project management; Stages; Architecture , engineering and construction industries; Decision making tool; Early design stages; Life cycle perspectives; Semi structured interviews; Social housing buildings; Structured analysis; Sustainable construction; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096976187

Impression management challenges the ethnographic researcher, who follows one actor on a building site. Shadowing allows a researcher to follow particular participants to observe their bodily movements and use of artefacts. Impression management happens when the observee acts in a different way than he/she would routinely, due to the presence of an audience. In the case of shadowing, the researcher can become an audience, as will the readers of the findings from the investigation. A study into contract managers' practices on-site uses shadowing as its primary method for data collection. A contract manager is being observed to gain an insight into the practices in which he participates. However, impression management presents a very noticeable challenge from the beginning of the study. We show how the researcher is perceived as an audience and how this prompts the observed contract manager to reflect on the practices on-site in dialogue with the researcher. On this basis, we raise the question, whether the continued performance of impression management by practitioners due to prolonged fieldwork can lead the observed practice to shift. In conclusion, we argue that the use of shadowing on a building site allows for insights into the complicated practices on site, but it may also influence and displace these practices. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.","Ethnography; Impression management; Research methods; Shadowing","Managers; Surveying; Bodily movement; Building sites; Construction management; Data collection; Ethnographic methods; Impression management; Project management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096966583

Strategic partnerships have so far been used in major construction programmes and can be seen as a hybridised organisational form that draws on multiple existing organisational forms in creating new interorganisational routines and developing collective knowledge. The objective of the paper is to explore how a strategic partnership creates new routines by developing collective knowledge, and how these routines are transferred to the constituent organisations as firm-specific routines. Empirically, we draw on data from a strategic partnership between the City of Copenhagen's client unit, ByK, and a group of six AEC firms that constitutes the consortium named TRUST. Data is collected in the period 2017-2019 and consists of 22 interviews describing developments in the strategic partnership and in the constituent firms. In the analysis, we apply an institutional theory perspective in a parallel analysis of developments in the strategic partnership and in two of the constituent firms (the client and the contractor). We show that the strategic partnership creates new interorganisational routines in pursuit of collective knowledge and that the constituent firms learn from their engagement in the strategic partnership, which leads to creation of new routines and changes in existing routines. As such, the paper contributes to an understanding of how new intraorganisational routines created in a strategic partnership ramify to firm-specific routines in the constituent firms. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.","Hybridity; Organisational learning; Routines; Strategic partnership","Construction industry; Copenhagen; Institutional theory; Inter-organisational; Inter-organisational relationships; Organisational; Parallel analysis; Strategic partnership; Project management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096963045

By considering SDG goal 12 for responsible consumption and production, buildings in Denmark account for 35% of the total waste and 40% of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Circular Economy (CE) Is one of the crucial concepts to reduce environmental impacts, including climate problems by reducing waste and resources. This can be achieved through the choice of alternative materials or solutions, by promoting the life cycle and circular mindset. Previous research has shown that circular design principles are not applied broadly, thus, the study aims to investigate the potential of using CE in building design to provide designers, consultants, and contractors, an insight into the various challenges, when adopting circular strategies to reduce the waste of resources and environmental impact. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, along with questionnaires and evaluation charts, with four respondents involved in building design, from architectural, consulting and developing organizations with different levels of experiences in sustainable buildings, specifically in using circular concepts. The interviews were analysed to investigate how CE is incorporated into building design unfolding barriers and pointing out some key factors to promote CE principles, e.g., organizations behaviour, collaboration, politics, and economy. The results indicate the complexity of the CE transition, as numerous aspects need to be considered. It reveals that actors can improve their interdisciplinary interactions to use circular principles, raising their awareness as true intermediaries in progressing wider sustainability goals. Other barriers are related to a lack of circular materials passports. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.","Circular economy; Design; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals","Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Project management; Surveys; Sustainable development; Alternative materials; Building sectors; Circular strategies; Evaluation charts; Interdisciplinary interactions; Semi structured interviews; Sustainable building; Waste of resources; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096959189

The aim of this study is to investigate how the SDGs can be implemented in construction projects in a Danish context, and which challenges building owners face working with the SDGs. A focus group workshop was held with 22 professional building owners to investigate which challenges they encounter and what is needed to support successful implementation, along with a survey focusing on their current implementation of the SDGs. The results showed that the five SDGs with the highest prioritization among the building owners were Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy), Goal 11 (sustainable cities and communities), Goal 13 (climate action), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), and Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production). 94% of the building owners had implemented, or wished to implement, the SDGs in various degrees. The main challenges experienced by the building owners were a lack of local indicators, tools and methods to support the implementation of the SDGs in construction, knowledge regarding the SDGs among the building owners, and extra costs related to the implementation of the SDGs. The main solutions suggested to overcome the challenges were the development of new tools and methods supporting the practical application of the SDGs in construction, e.g., dialogue tools for goal setting and prioritisation and for measuring performance regarding the SDG in construction, along with practical examples and knowledge aimed towards the actors within the construction industry.

Following the adoption, the Danish government made Statistics Denmark (SD) the responsible authority for national SDG reporting. The strategy to fulfill this task has been to work closely with stakeholders in the business community, public authorities and NGO's. SD has further worked to implement the SDG-framework on the business sector, in particular inspired by work done in UNCTAD about indicators for business entity reporting on economic, environmental, social and institutional issues. The work in SD has shown that it is possible to provide SDG-relevant information by type of industry using existing statistical data. Emission of CO2 and energy efficiency are examples from the environmental economic accounts. Social and business statistics can provide data on employment and wages broken down by gender, and also follow the development in occupational injuries, just to mention a few examples. However, existing data cannot provide information on how enterprises work with the SDGs. To cover this aspect, a survey among the largest private Danish enterprises was conducted in 2019. A third type of data source may be created by adding additional questions to existing surveys.

MDL is now widely acknowledged as a strategic activity to avoid increasing the respondent burden when meeting new user demands on e.g. globalisation. MDL is a strong method in combining micro data on individual entities such as enterprises, people or in a combination of both (Linked Employer-Employee Data). MDL is one of the most powerful methods to answer urgent questions on emerging policy or research topics such as the interconnectedness of the economies and its consequences for jobs, income and growth. Not only for national purposes, where economic behavior and dynamics by enterprises can be expressed in terms of job dynamics, income and welfare for its citizens, but also from an international perspective where consistent and coherent indicators play an important role. Firstly, the article addresses the central role of the Business Register for any MDL approach related to business statistics; secondly the current official statistics based on MDL such as Trade by Enterprise Characteristics (TEC) are described.

The idea and practice of corporate sustainability is no longer a niche movement. Investors are increasingly paying attention to sustainability factors in their analysis and decision-making, thus reinforcing market transformation. In this book, high-level practitioners and academic thought leaders, including contributions from John Ruggie, Fiona Reynolds, Johan Rockström, and Paul Polman, explain the forces behind these developments. The contributors highlight (a) that systemic market change is influenced by various contextual factors that impact how sustainable investing is perceived and practiced; (b) that the integration of ESG factors in investment decisions is impacting markets on a large scale and hence changes practices of major market players (e.g. pension funds); and (c) that technology and the increasing datafication of sustainability act as further accelerators of such change. The book goes beyond standard economic theory approaches to sustainable investing and emphasizes that capitalism founded on more real-world (complex) economics and cooperation can strengthen ESG integration. Aimed at both investment professionals and academics, this book gives the reader access to more practitioner-relevant information and it also discusses implementation issues.

How we have come to think of nationality as a diversity attribute has shaped the types of research questions we have asked and the type of phenomena we have studied. Nationality has almost exclusively been conceived as a carrier of “national culture” and/or as a status-neutral “identity marker”. Accordingly, national differences have appeared to produce “heterogeneity” rather than “inequality”. Discussing the difference between diversity as heterogeneity and diversity as inequality, I argue that national differences can and must be conceptualized and operationalized as both because the same social category can be shown to produce both homophily (i.e., identification) and imparity (i.e., stratification) depending on how it is measured. Using an empirical example of multinational teams, I illustrate the measurement of nationality as a nominal parameter generating identity-based subgroups associated with homogeneity/heterogeneity and homophily. At the same time, I show how nationality can be measured as a graduated parameter generating resource-based subgroups associated with equality/inequality and imparity. I briefly discuss the implications of nationality as a diversity variable giving rise to identification and stratification, which are two key issues in diversity scholarship. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096269113

First, the accelerating nature of change in different domains (e.g., technological development and change vis-a-vis the natural environment) is a key concern underlying the ESG debate. While these changes create uncertainties that investors have to cope with, they also create opportunities for markets to transition in new, more sustainable, directions. Second, sustainable investment by itself is a paradigm shift in traditional investment thinking. It challenges fundamental assumptions about markets and even the capitalist system itself. Finally, while we gain more and more knowledge about sustainable investing, we may find that believing in this knowledge (and the very idea of shaping future markets through sustainable investing) is equally needed.

They are required to report on policies, actions and outcomes regarding their environmental impact, social and employee matters, impact on human rights and corruption. Denmark introduced mandatory corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting already in 2009, while Germany had no specific legislation on CSR reporting before 2017. Some authors allege that regulation positively impacts CSR reporting, while others argue that the voluntary nature of CSR reporting is essential (Romolini, Fissi, & Gori, 2014). Critics of mandatory reporting claim that non-financial reporting should develop bottom-up, as mandatory one-size-fits-all solutions are inappropriate given the differences among companies (ICC, 2015). The aim of this chapter is to evaluate the effect of legislation on reporting quality by comparing Denmark with a long tradition for mandatory reporting and Germany introducing mandatory rather recently. However, a rich body of literature exists on factors impacting CSR reporting other than legislation. These are among others: firm size, ownership structure, industrial sector and culture (Hahn & Kühnen, 2013.) The chapter applies a content analysis of 150 CSR reports from German and Danish listed companies between 2008 and 2017 from four different industrial sectors. The chapter finds that mandatory reporting improves overall report quality by lifting the quality floor, yet, without lifting the quality ceiling. Size is important as improvements in reporting are largest in small and medium-sized companies. Companies in environmentally sensitive sectors tend to disclose more relevant environmental information than companies in less sensitive sectors. Both culture and ownership structure has a moderating effect on report quality. © 2020 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Development; Dialogue; Disclosure; Isomorphic pressure; Longitudinal study; Size",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096073396

It focuses on export manufacturers in a relatively less researched context of low-income developing countries. Drawing on the interplay among three theoretical foundations and insights from multiple-case studies, research findings underpinning the explored phenomenon include: growing demand; lack of input materials to fulfil customer needs in high-income developed countries; own brand manufacturing; capability to overcome foreign competition; and more exports to the proximate regional markets. Only firms with higher capability to mobilise, use and upgrade idiosyncratic resources stand a better chance to generate exports revenue from high-value but competitive developed countries. Generally, these findings suggest that while firms need to build a strategic fit with competitive business environments, home countries need to improve their investment environments to attract competitive and well networked firms.

Specifically, it examines how companies constructed strategies of action to produce and organise social accounting practices under different sociopolitical and economic contexts prior to and after the Arab Spring. Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on Swidler's theory of “Culture Toolkit” and 43 semi-structured interviews with 17 firms and their stakeholders in the Arab region. Findings: The study argues that context influences social accounting practices by shaping a cultural toolkit of habits, skills and styles from which companies develop their social accounting related strategies of action. During “settled” periods, companies draw on resources to develop their social accounting practices whilst they seek knowledge and feedback on boundaries and expectations of the socio-political and economic contexts.

AM is developing rapidly, and extant research reveals that the technology contains possibilities for firms to develop competitive advantages, but that it also poses several challenges to overcome before such benefits can be achieved. To provide further insight into this topic, this paper aims to analyse how a business association can disseminate knowledge and experience about AM to its members. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on 13 interviews from 11 different organisations within an embedded single-case study of a Danish non-profit business association. Findings: The paper identifies 12 motivational factors for joining the association as well as seven perceived challenges in the current setup of the association. The paper demonstrates that barriers to the use of AM can be reduced through participation in a business association. Research limitations/implications: The paper is based on a single-case study design and does not provide a foundation for statistical generalisations. The challenges identified are biased towards the companies that are members and do not represent companies that either consciously or unconsciously are not part of the association. Practical implications: Being aware of the barriers for AM is important to optimize the benefits of joining a business association. However, operating such an association with the purpose of disseminating AM knowledge involves the inherent dilemma of protecting knowledge for the individual members, and at the same time, fostering knowledge sharing. Originality/value: The paper provides novel data on how a business association can help mitigate perceived barriers to using AM. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","3D print; Associations; Industry 4.0; Network administrative organization; Small and medium-sized enterprises","Additives; Competition; Joining; Profitability; Business associations; Competitive advantage; Design/methodology/approach; Knowledge and experience; Knowledge-sharing; Non-profit; Study design; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094965102

Doing ethnographic research in a postcolonial setting conducted by white researchers, it is impossible to erase a white researcher body, which in itself is a marker of politics, privileges, and resources. This chapter draws on ethnographic experiences from a study of the Greenlandic Police Force conducted by two white (assumed Danish) researchers. As Greenland is a former Danish colony, the chapter describes and discusses the researchers’ ethnographic journey into the colonial past (and neocolonial present) of Greenland, considering how the researchers’ own bodies influenced - and were influenced by - the research process. Analyzing our ethnographic field data with this in mind, we explore how our whiteness (and thus assumed “Danishness”) influences and affects relations between researchers and participants, and hence, the data and insights generated from this research. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094598380

However, despite the development of extensive lists of possible problem features and suggested solution principles there is little guidance on how these should be connected. Therefore, in this work we systematically examine interactions between major problem features and solution principles, based on an analysis of 218 behavioural design interventions drawn from 139 cases across design domains and foci. This forms the basis for a number of contributions. First, we bring together behavioural and designerly perspectives on problem characterisation via two proposed problem features: change demand and behavioural constraint, related in a two-by-two framework. Second, we synthesised recommendations from across domains and foci to operationalise a list of 23 solution principles relevant to designers. Third, we link these insights in a proposed Behavioural Problem/Solution (BPS) matrix. Further, we identify a number of potential systemic challenges in the reporting and evidencing of behavioural design interventions. Together, these insights substantially extend both theory and practice surrounding problem-solution mapping in behavioural design, and form a foundation for further theory development and synthesis in this area. © 2020 Cash, Khadilkar, Jensen, Dusterdich, & Mugge.","Behavioural Design; Design for Behaviour Change; Design for Sustainable Behaviour; Persuasive Design; Persuasive Technology; Problem-Framing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093885998

As value-based pricing is much more individualized and data-driven, it becomes increasingly important to validate one’s pricing hypotheses by estimating the causal effects of pricing interventions. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are conceptually the best method for making such causal inferences. However, RCTs are complicated, expensive, and often not feasible. MAN Energy Solutions was facing a similar challenge. In reaction to his, we conducted an action design research study (ADR) in which we designed and implemented a novel causal inference system for value-based spare parts pricing. Based on this, we formalize design principles for the broader class of such systems that emphasize the need for pre-aggregation when dealing with lumpy aftersales data, scalability when having to run numerous analyses on heterogenous spare parts portfolios, and incorporating unaffectedness conditions that help to avoid spillover effects caused by often interdependent spare parts purchases. Also, they encourage analysts to take pre-intervention predictability into account when interpreting causal effects, to incorporate a manipulated treatment variable into the causal inference model, and to present the system output in interactive user interfaces to aid understanding and acceptance. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Action design research; Causal inference; Industrial marketing; Spare parts; Value-based pricing","User interfaces; Causal inferences; Design Principles; Energy solutions; Interactive user interfaces; Original equipment manufacturers; Randomized controlled trial; Spillover effects; Value-based pricing; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093841815

Despite this, the study of lead times and their nature has received remarkably little attention in literature. In this research we prove there exists an interdependency between lead time and service level measure, and thus the magnitude of the bullwhip effect. In a multi-echelon supply chain setting, the decision maker can experience disproportionate bullwhip effect. One cause of this is the fact that lead time distribution may likely stem from skewed and peaked distributions. As a member of a multi-echelon supply chain, a firm can experience an order variance that depend on the total number of echelon and information about their lead-time dependencies. These results correspond well with the few contributions found in literature showing actual lead times.

However, the vast majority of research focuses mainly on China and India and their bottom of the pyramid (BoP) customers. Against this background, our research investigates frugal innovation and its reception in Brazil. We analyse six Brazilian company cases (three multinational corporations and three small and medium-sized enterprises) in terms of frugal product development, product characteristics, and commercialisation approaches, as well as compare these organisations with findings from Asian lead markets. Our results confirm that the principal dimensions of frugal innovation are cost-effectiveness and ease of use. However, the findings also contradict the paradigm that frugal innovation must be essentially low-cost. Based on these results, we propose a twofold approach to the cost criterion that differentiates between the company's and the customer's perspective and focuses on value-based pricing. Further, distinctive product features, branding, and specific marketing activities are crucial for successful frugal innovation in Brazil. This research extends the classification of frugal innovation in prior literature and suggests understanding frugal dimensions as a set of building blocks that can be flexibly applied to frugal product development depending on the context and regional requirements.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the data from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey (IMSS VI). Specifically, this paper uses a subset of the IMSS VI data set from the 606 plants that identified themselves as one of the plants in a manufacturing network. Findings: The results demonstrate plant role has a moderating effect on the relationship between internal manufacturing network integration and external supply chain integration, but not on the relationship between external supply chain integration and operational performance. Our research also highlights that plant role moderates the mediating effect of external supply chain integration on the relationship between internal manufacturing network integration and operational performance.

This type of situation can generate negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety, which might affect the well-being, hope and consumption behavior of individuals. The present work aims, therefore, to propose that prosocial consumption could help reduce the negative emotional effects caused by social distancing. Method: The study is a combination of a literature review and the development of a theoretical conceptual model that identifies gaps and presents research proposals that can guide future studies. Originality: Existing literature characterizes prosocial consumption as a consequence of positive emotions. This paper aims to explain how prosocial consumption can generate well-being even in situations in which negative emotional states are being experienced. Contributions: The theoretical conceptual model developed by this study explains the role of prosocial consumption as a behavior that reduces the negative effects of the negative emotions caused by social distancing and promotes well-being during the COVID-19 crisis. Understanding these mechanisms is beneficial to consumers, to the public sector and to the private sector, which can adopt strategies for fostering prosocial behavior and increasing well-being, but also for increasing sales and enhancing brand equity. © 2020 Croatian Philosophical Society.

A combination of qualitative and quantitative research was employed to group farmers into segments according to their willingness to adopt quinoa. Findings from this study indicate that farmers in Adana perceive quinoa as a crop likely to be adopted in their cropping system if they can gain market access with the new crop. Farmers' previous knowledge regarding the crop, concerns about drought and salt risk and farm characteristics also appear to be determining the farmers' attitude towards new crops.

The aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the participatory process of involving patients and relatives in development of a surgical breast cancer patient pathway. The overall design was insider action research and included two Danish surgical breast cancer clinics. In dialogue meetings patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) discussed suggestions for improving the pathway. Patients and relatives were satisfied with the pathway organisation in general. However, suggestions related to information, communication, and choice of treatment were presented. In response to this, a patient decision aid was developed, tested, and implemented, and HCPs increased focus on male relatives, and made minor changes to the pathway. Participants were satisfied with the participatory process, however, recommendations for future dialogue meetings included shortening the follow-up period, using a skilled facilitator, reminding HCPs being open-minded, and emphasizing for patients and relatives that participation may require a surplus of mental resources. Overall, recommendations on patient involvement obtained from this project could, due to their general relevance, be implemented in clinical settings other than breast cancer. Furthermore, action research proved a suitable design for research on patient involvement. © The Author(s) 2020.","action research; breast neoplasms; continuity of patient care; health services; Patient involvement; questionnaire",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092585963

This indicates that hedge accounting information is valued by the market. Further, we develop a proxy to measure whether hedge accounting is economically favorable. Only if the effects of a bank’s hedge accounting are economically favorable, hedge accounting disclosures are positively associated with market values. We find cross-sectional differences when adopting hedge accounting for subsample analyses of European regions. In addition, distinguishing between troubled and non-troubled banks, the results only hold for the latter category suggesting that troubled banks suffer from biased accounting information. Our results are important for standard setters and banks when seeking to understand the capital market effects of hedge accounting and their disclosures. © 2020, American Accounting Association.

One of the basic principles to protect an efficient and streamlined flow is to constantly analyse passenger behaviour and map potentials gaps.This paper will introduce the reader as to how the airport has solved the challenge of having many different processes gathered — and still keeping the passenger experience in mind.The use of automation for the passenger flow is in force: ●WEB check-in ●KIOSK check-in ●Self-service bag drop● Self-service scanning at the entrance to the security area ●Self-service boarding ●Self-service KIOSK at Arrival Service The buzz word is ‘common use environment’, and the reader will be invited behind the scene and learn — not only why common use environment is essential — but also how the airport has succeeded in having this strategy and what initiatives they have taken in order to support the strategy. Billund Airport has also introduced automation on the ramp side — optimising the processes for baggage handling while also protecting the working environment via the use of power stow and a bulk baggage handling system.Throughout the paper, the different processes are well described, and statistics and photographs illustrate and underline the aim of the content — namely ‘Self-service and automation for increasing capacity, flow and satisfaction’. © HENRY STEWART PUBLICATIONS 1750-1938.","Automation; Bag drop; Boarding; Home-printed bag tag; Scanning; Self-service",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092246092

However, studies show that incumbent firms have persistent problems with adopting and scaling such practices.In this paper, we present an empirical account of agile transformation in a large manufacturing company that has adopted the SAFe framework. Based on interviews, focus groups, and observation data, we identify three themes for understanding how employees experience and cope with transformative change by: 1) making sense of the new, 2) practicing with peers and 3) letting go of legacy. Key findings are that initially employees are more concerned with making sense of the new rather than with the implementation of agile itself and that implementation of agile happens very gradually over time rather than through major breakthroughs. Thus, it takes time for employees to weather change, become acquainted with the new way of working and stabilize how they work together in the agile teams and across the ARTs (Agile Release Trains). We contribute to extant literature with insight into the human implications of agile transformation. © The Author(s) 2020.","Agile transformation; Case study; Manufacturing; Software development","Manufacture; Software design; Agile teams; Agile transformations; Focus groups; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing IS; Observation data; Release trains; Weather change; Personnel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092202513

Studies have demonstrated how boat-based cetacean-watching tourism can cause both short-term and long-term effects on targeted populations. However, limited attention has been given to the effect of swim-with activities on humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This study qualified whale responses to swim-with activities off Reunion Island during the 2018 humpback whales breeding season. We used both under- and above-water videos collected from social media outlets, commercial whale-watching operators, and audiovisual professionals. We documented a high rate of agonistic whale behaviors (during 42.1% of all observations; n = 164) towards swimmers within videos containing swim-with events. We documented seven agonistic behaviors including threat, attack, or defense behaviors that were predominantly exhibited by mother/calf groups (73.8%; n = 121) and by singletons (16.5%; n = 27). Pectoral shears (27.4%) and fluke thrashes (23.2%) were the most exhibited agonistic whale behaviors aimed towards swimmers, both of which pose a danger and serious injury to swimmers. During swim-with attempts whales changed their behavioral state (82.3%, n = 159) and used avoidance tactics to avoid swimmers (56.1%, n = 92). Whales exhibited a higher rate of agonistic behaviors when swim groups were active and dispersed, in contrast to when they were quiet and compact. To mitigate whale disturbance and improve swimmer safety, we recommend avoiding swimming with whale groups containing calfs. Our findings support the implementation of strong regulations and educational tools to ensure a sustainable practice of whale watching off the Reunion Island.

However, the human resource (HR) function within small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has been slow to adopt this innovation. Drawing on the organizational learning theory (OLT), this study aims to propose that BD can improve HR functions, especially of SMEs, thereby yielding them a competitive edge. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed unstructured data from 41 journal papers, based on which, a conceptual framework was developed. Further, this framework was validated with responses collected from 148 SMEs in India. Findings: Bibliometric analysis and results of partial least squares techniques revealed that better BD quality is needed to improve HR practices, human resource service quality (HRSQ) and innovation competency of SMEs. Research limitations/implications: This paper contributes to the extant literature by considering strategic management theories such as resource-based view and OLT to evaluate BDA’s effect on organizational functional practices such as HR and HRSQ. Practical implications: In Indian SMEs, BD quality has a substantial effect on BD HR practices and HRSQ. However, these factors influence can constructively impact SMEs, if SMEs are open to organizational change, whereby they need to develop technical skills and competencies of the HR professionals. Originality/value: Though BD research works have shown exponential growth in recent times, scholarly empirical research investigating BD’s impact upon human resource management (HRM) is scarce. The present study appraises extant literature on BD in HRM. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Big data quality; Big data-driven human resource practices; Human resource service quality; Innovation competency; Organizational learning theory; SMEs; Structural equation modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091769319

Engagements with nature can positively affect well-being and healthy ageing, but challenges remain to move beyond framing ageing as inevitable, gradual decline and disengagement, towards active and healthy engagements with nature. So far, little attention has been paid to how different ways of being in and relating to nature can facilitate active healthy ageing. Through go-alongs and interventions in the Danish Wadden Sea National Park, we explore how and why older adults relate to nature. Drawing on Heidegger’s (1927/1962) notion of ‘Dasein’ and theories of therapeutic mobilities, we discuss how older adults engage in nature, with nature, or become through nature. By re-framing these variations of engagement, the theoretical contribution represents different archetypes of engagement with nature, where active healthy ageing transpires through therapeutic mobilities that enable complex fields of relations with others and nature. For nature to contribute to active and healthy ageing requires a fundamental shift from understanding nature as static and other-to-man to evanescent versions of individuals’ subjective being. The latter acknowledges the embeddedness of walking, emotional geographies and therapeutic landscapes. Recognising that ‘nature is not just nature’ points to the insufficiency of merely promoting walking or offering access to being in nature. Instead, active healthy ageing with nature becomes a matter of setting the enabling conditions for a population of highly heterogeneous older adults to continuously engage with nature in ways that facilitate transformative experiences. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","experiences; healthy ageing; Nature; older adults; therapeutic mobilities; walking",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091354617

Despite previous research mapping the factors affecting time performance, site-managers have difficulties in reducing the time-overrun. In order to create a clearer guidance on how to control time-performance, this study investigates the resource related factors because they are within the site-manager’s control. Three Case studies were followed and a survey including 36 participants where conducted. Both investigated and ranked the likelihood of delay due to the seven different resource factors. The ranking of the resource factors was identified as: (1) Construction design, (2) Connecting works, (3) External conditions, (4) Work force, (5) Components and materials, (6) Space, (7) Equipment and machinery. The site-manager’s focus should be avoiding the factors that most often is found to cause time-overrun, which are construction design and connecting work that constitute about 60% of the time-overruns. The comparison of the studies revealed that construction professionals were unable to distinguish between the less and the low frequent factors causing time-overrun. Future survey studies should take into consideration that construction professionals’ preserved reality does not always correspond to the observed reality. Indicators include low variation between factors and limited use of the scale. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","delay; key factors; lean; preconditions; productivity; Scheduling",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091225324

In addition, the authors want to feed back their experience with PhiloLab as they believe that this way of idea generation could also be of interest to the wider evidence-based human resource management (EBHRM) community. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used some workshop sessions to brainstorm new conceptual ideas in a structured and efficient way with a multidisciplinary group of 14 (mainly academic) participants using PhiloLab. This is a tool from the social simulation community, which stimulates and formally supports discussions about philosophical questions of future societal models by means of developing conceptual agent-based simulation models. This was followed by an analysis of the qualitative data gathered during the PhiloLab sessions, feeding into the definition of a set of primary axioms of a plastic organisation. Findings: The PhiloLab experiment helped with defining a set of primary axioms of a plastic organisation, which are presented in this viewpoint article. The results indicated that the problem was rather complex, but it also showed good potential for an agent-based simulation model to tackle some of the key issues related to OP. The experiment also showed that PhiloLab was very useful in terms of knowledge and idea gathering. Originality/value: Through information gathering and open debates on how to create an agent-based simulation model of a plastic organisation, the authors could identify some of the characteristics of OP and start structuring some of the parameters for a computational simulation. With the outcome of the PhiloLab experiment, the authors are paving the way towards future exploratory computational simulation studies of OP. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agent-based modelling; Community modelling; Disorganisation; Organisational behaviour; PhiloLab; Plasticity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090844326

The article investigates four elements of the SIB-model: 1) the configuration of roles and responsibilities, 2) service provision, 3) payment structure, and 4) evaluation. The findings show the existence of blurred boundaries between organisational stakeholders within the investigated SIB-programme, indicating a dynamic configuration of roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, both service provision and data collection procedures were conducted in close collaboration with the involved public authorities, implying an interdependent relationship between public authorities and external partners. Thus, the empirical findings indicate a divergence from traditional concepts of social impact bonds–specifically concerning their design and development.

It argues that to be norm-critically oriented is about nurturing bodily and spatial awareness. In analyzing empirical material about disclosure of sexuality in a Danish workplace context, the chapter illuminates the diversity work of non-conforming bodies that inhabit normative organizational spaces differently and shows how analytical attention to social norms can nuance perceptions about sexuality in organization(s). It complicates common-sensical (mis)understanding of disclosure automatically leading to inclusion of non-heterosexual employees. And it challenges the explanatory apparatus of homophobia, suggesting instead that the heterosexual employees’ double standards and derogatory language directed at their non-heterosexual colleagues are better explored as shaped by heteronormativity. The chapter reviews and situates norm critique within literature on social norms in organization and diversity management studies. The author calls for norm-critical reflection upon researcher positionality, that is, the normative assumptions informing research practice, and, conclusively, evaluates strengths and weaknesses of norm critique in addition to discussing its ethics. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089255141

Design/methodology/approach: By deepening the conceptual understanding of service networks and their central properties, an overview of the learning challenges for improved performance is provided. The implications of learning are then discussed using four conceptual types to advance our understanding of learning in various service networks. Two different frameworks are combined, one designed to analyze the properties of service delivery and the other to understand their interorganizational learning implications for different types of service networks. Findings: This paper examines the central properties of service network delivery and explains their implications for interorganizational learning strategy operationalized in a service network typology. Practical implications: The proposed framework deepens the understanding of the concept of service networks and brings attention to properties that have implication for interorganizational learning. Knowing the central properties in detail and their major organizing challenges allows for learning strategies to improve service network performance. Originality/value: The value lies in the deepening the understanding of interorganizational learning in service networks, which is much needed in the growing body of literature on both concepts. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Interactivity; Interorganizational learning; Organizing; Service networks; Strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089198540

HEMS is vital for the effective performance of an nZEB to maximize the grid power independency. An nZEB with its HEMS works in an effective and economical way as long as these steps including modeling, operation, and protection are defined well and work in a proper way. Thereby, the modeling, real-time operation, and protection approaches need to be studied in-depth in order to have an effective nZEB. This chapter studies different modeling techniques such as mathematic models and data-driven approaches for nZEB components that include solar photovoltaic (PV) array, home load demand, energy storage systems (ESS), electric vehicle (EV), and heat pump (HP). The impact of uncertainties is analyzed for the performance of the different home component models. The benefits, challenges, impacts, and problems of employing these techniques are presented and some of them are proposed in detail. Online control techniques, such as online scheduling, model predictive control (MPC), and stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), are presented and an MPC is implemented to minimize home grid power dependency. Last but not least, the protection methods are executed to protect the correct performance of the house and increase the security of the system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Home energy management system; Model predictive control; Modeling; Net-zero energy building; Protection; Stochastic optimization; Uncertainties",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088929228

Design/methodology/approach: Information processing theory is used to frame the hypotheses and findings. A questionnaire was sent to the 300 largest companies in Iceland, where environmental uncertainty has been prevalent. Findings: The results indicate that increased uncertainty leads to a larger variety of non-financial performance measures, such as customer measures. A positive relationship is found between management satisfaction with the performance measurement system and firm performance. However, the variety of performance measures was not linked to management satisfaction or firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The results suggest that managers increase the variety of performance measures when uncertainty increases. However, it is not the variety itself that increases management satisfaction or improves firm performance. Practical implications: Performance measurement design is affected by environmental uncertainty. Managers focus on important stakeholder groups such as customers under such conditions and can consult research and practice for the purpose of customer relationship management and customer profitability measurement to improve measurement selection.

Furthermore, it attempts to identify the key shifts (and convergence) that have taken place in the value system across generational cohorts. Design/methodology/approach: In this context, the first stage of the study involved an in-depth systematic analysis of extant literature on multigenerational workforce between 2001–2009 and 2010–2018 by applying bibliometric analysis. Following an explanatory mix-method approach, the second stage of the study comprised of 32 interviews conducted across generations, exploring the role of ethics at the workplace. Findings: It was revealed that during the period 2001–2009, communication and identification of generational characteristics emerged as the major themes. The 2010–2018 period unraveled four themes of research – retaining and engaging millennials through leadership, generational differences in work values, impact of generational differences on organizational-level variables and generational diversity in education and nursing. The outcome from the second stage showed that work values differ across generations with an emphasis on intrinsic work values, and work values have rather deteriorated, with baby boomers possessing stronger work ethics in comparison to the millennials. Finally, an integrated model for multigenerational workforce has been proposed. Research limitations/implications: This paper provides significant inputs to the expanding research in the area of work values, as it delves into the principal mechanisms leading to differences in work values among generations. Originality/value: Bibliometric analysis, which is a quantitative approach to understanding the intellectual structure of a research topic, has been applied to generational diversity at the workplace.

The OBOR Initiative is a policy strategy aiming to promote connectivity and cooperation among countries along China’s ancient maritime and overland trade routes. It can also be seen as Beijing’s grand cross-region “international public goods” (IPGs) ranging from physical infrastructure, such as network of roadways, railways, maritime ports, power grids, oil and gas pipelines, and associated infrastructure projects, to special economic zones. This grand project represents China’s “go global” strategy and outward expansion, and it will no doubt strengthen regional “common goods” in terms of direction utility, risk reduction, and capacity enhancement. Studying the OBOR Initiative through the IPGs angle also implicitly helps to project China as an emerging responsible “global normative power” who is struggling to create a Eurasian “community of common destiny.” Chinese norms (policies and institutions) are being diffused by the “causal” effect of the Chinese model of economic success and through the OBOR-related economic activities, such as trade, investment, technical assistance, and infrastructural development. The rise of Chinese normative power is going hand in hand with Beijing’s increasing role in international financial institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). When China’s hard power of the OBOR (production, trade, finance) continues to equip China as an international public goods provider, and its international institutional role continues to increase, China’s soft power of the OBOR (norms, values, institutions, and policies) will also expand. In this context, it is expected that the world will continue to witness the clashes between the emerging world order brought about by China’s global rise and the existing world order led by the USA. And the OBOR Initiative is and will be one of the frontlines of the China-US conflict. © The Author(s) 2020.","Infrastructure; International public goods; OBOR initiative; World order",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088470296

Design/methodology/approach: Evidence is collected by designing and implementing an agent-based computational simulation model (the IOP 2.0) where employees have the option to use external resources and the social environment to perform tasks. As plasticity is more effective when change and uncertainty are high, the simulation features an increase in the difficulty and number of tasks to which employees need to cope. Findings: Cooperation and sharing of competence and ability are key to cognitive plasticity. Being able to master the use of some resources, together with other employees’ competencies, make some achieve the most efficient task performance. Practical implications: The findings suggest that under conditions of change and plasticity, human resource management (HRM) shall attempt to develop measures to support employees' cognitive skills necessary to cope with it, for example, mostly through diagnosis, training and facilitating on-the-job dialogue.

In order to mainstream an approach to social change such as responsible research and innovation (RRI) and make it into a practical reality rather than an abstract ideal, we need to have conceptual clarity and empirical evidence. But, in order to be able to gather empirical evidence, we have to presuppose that the approach already exists in practice. This paper proposes a social lab methodology that is suited to deal with this circularity. The methodology combines the defining features of social labs emerging from the literature such as agility and real-world focus with established theories and approaches such as action research and experiential learning. Thereby it enables the parallel investigation and propagation of RRI. The framework thus constructed provides a theoretical embedding of social labs and overcomes some of the known limitations of the constitutive approaches. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

While the individuals with preserved soft tissue have been subjected to numerous and comprehensive studies, the less famous bog skeletons have received much less attention, even though the distinction is essentially attributable solely to differences in preservation conditions. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by providing valuable information on ten bog skeletons from the small region of Vesthimmerland in northwest Denmark. The large majority (nine out of ten) of these finds are previously unpublished. We.apply a cross-disciplinary approach consisting of osteological and paleopathological investigations combined with radiocarbon and strontium isotope analyses. Our radiocarbon results show that two of the ten bog skeletons (two adult females) date to the Nordic Neolithic Age, one 8-year old child dates to the Nordic Bronze Age, while the majority are from the Pre-Roman Iron Age and Roman Iron Age (one child, four adult females and two adult males). Anthropological examination suggested no evidence of peri-mortem violence, but the finding of gross pathologies in two individuals could hint at deliberate deposition in the bog. Nine individuals yielded strontium isotopic values suggesting a local origin, whereas a female dating to the Pre- Roman Iron Age yielded highly radiogenic signatures suggesting a non-local origin. These results represent the first cross-disciplinary study of numerous bog skeletons adding much needed information to a neglected group of individuals, shedding new light on the different theories for the deposition of human remains in bogs in prehistoric times. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bog skeletons; Bronze age; Denmark; Iron age; Neolithic; Peri-mortem violence; Strontium isotopes","Deposition; Group theory; Iron; Isotopes; Musculoskeletal system; Strontium; Adult females; Cross-disciplinary; Cross-disciplinary approaches; Human remains; Isotopic values; Neolithic ages; Preservation condition; Strontium isotopes; Wetlands",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087676966

Differently from players, no health and physical fitness maintenance guidelines were published for match officials. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to guide a safe and successful return to play for match officials. Research methods: Before the return to structured conditioning and officiating, match officials must perform a medical assessment, as well as systematic COVID-19 testing and detailed pulmonary function evaluation. The hygienic-sanitary prevention strategies for virus transmission must be strictly followed. Results and findings: In the remaining part of the present season, alterations of the game rules, namely halves of 30-40 min and no allowance for lost time, aiming to reduce the match officials physiological load may result as a safer option. Nonetheless, match officials' cognitive and physical demands, will probably be exacerbated by the increased number of substitutions per game, proposed to reduce players' match load.

The retailer decides on the selling price while the manufacturer regulates the green quality of the product. To initiate the channel coordination and to establish a win-win outcome for both parties, a hybrid of ‘greening cost sharing’ and ‘revenue sharing’ contract (HGRS) is developed. This study contributes to the literature by providing an analytical approach to address the channel coordination and pricing issues in a green supply chain under the consumer environmental awareness while the manufacturer has the ability of enhancing, with investments, the product’s green quality. Our study reveals that: (a) the proposed HGRS contract is capable of achieving channel coordination while both supply chain members gain more profit than in decentralised decision making, (b) the new suggested contract enhances the product’s green quality, reduces the selling price, and stimulates the market demand, and (c) HGRS contract results in more satisfied customers (by offering low prices) as well as more sustainable operations (by increasing greenness level) at the same time. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumer environmental awareness; environmental quality; green supply chain; revenue sharing; Supply chain coordination","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Sales; Supply chains; Analytical approach; Channel coordination; Decentralised decision makings; Environmental awareness; Green supply chain; Revenue-sharing; Sustainable operations; Two-echelon supply chain; Green manufacturing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087590259

This study aims to investigate the relationship between different supplier co-creation modes (operationally independent [OI] and operationally dependent [OD]) and uncertainty criticality arising during ES development. Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a conceptual framework of five uncertainty types by synthesizing the relevant literature from service management and new product development. This framework guided the empirical work of two in-depth case studies, describing uncertainty criticality in OI and OD supplier co-creation. Findings: The findings show that environmental and organizational uncertainty were generally of high criticality for ES development independently of the supplier co-creation mode. Moreover, uncertainty criticality varied between the two cases, with higher criticality of technical and relational uncertainty as well as less resource uncertainty experienced by the focal organization in the OD case. This suggests that supplier co-creation constitutes an uncertainty reallocation. Research limitations/implications: Further research is needed to test the generalizability of the qualitative results through quantitative studies. Originality/value: This research contributes to the service management literature by showing the varying uncertainty profiles manufacturing organizations face when engaging in different supplier co-creation modes.

It documents strengths of the SDGs, areas of common ground, disparities and possible future trajectories. The processes leading to the SDGs were comparatively speaking notably inclusive, which has provided much more widespread awareness and support. In declared content, too, the SDGs are in several ways potentially transformative: applying to all countries, multidimensional, linking issues of sustainability and development. They include much of what is desirable from capability and human security perspectives and are more encompassing than what capability scholars have offered in practical assessments of human well-being. They offer policy spaces and processes that can facilitate progress on various fronts. However, they contain important limitations and dangers, including in regard to the continuing commitment to unending growth, the relations between the goals, targets and indicators, the power structures that lie behind these, and how the goals will be interpreted and used at national and local levels. Capabilities analysis and human development and human security approaches can play essential roles of critique and enrichment, including questioning the belief in unending growth and illuminating the variety of understandings of development and of a meaningful well-considered human life.

There is also a gap in the research literature on maintenance work hour estimation. This paper investigates the use of machine-learning algorithms to predict maintenance work hours and proposes a method that utilizes historical preventive maintenance order data to predict maintenance work hours. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses the design research methodology utilizing a case study to validate the proposed method. Findings: The case study analysis confirms that the proposed method is applicable and has the potential to significantly improve work hour prediction accuracy, especially for medium- and long-term work orders. Moreover, the study finds that this method is more accurate and more efficient than conducting estimations based on experience. Practical implications: The study has major implications for industrial applications. Maintenance-intensive industries such as oil and gas and chemical industries spend a huge portion of their operational expenditures (OPEX) on maintenance. This research will enable them to accurately predict work hour requirements that will help them to avoid unwanted downtime and costs and improve production planning and scheduling. Originality/value: The proposed method provides new insights into maintenance theory and possesses a huge potential to improve the current maintenance planning practices in the industry. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Estimation; Machine learning; Maintenance; Maintenance management; Planning; Prediction; Work hour","Chemical industry; Forecasting; Gas industry; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Petroleum industry; Planning; Production control; Case study analysis; Design research methodologies; Design/methodology/approach; Maintenance activity; Maintenance planning; Operational expenditures; Prediction accuracy; Production planning and scheduling; Maintenance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087130204

We focus on two key aspects that Vattenfall must address in its wind farm design process. The first is determining where to locate the turbines. This aspect is important because the placement of each turbine creates interference on the neighboring turbines, causing a power loss at the overall farm level. The optimizers must minimize this interference based on the wind conditions; however, they must also consider the other costs involved, which depend on factors such as the water depth or soil conditions at each position. The second aspect involves determining how to interconnect the turbines with cables (i.e., cable optimization). This requires Vattenfall to consider both the immediate costs and long-term costs connected with the electrical infrastructure. We developed mixed-integer programming models and matheuristic techniques to solve the two problems as they arise in practical applications. The resulting tools have given Vattenfall a competitive advantage at multiple levels. They facilitate increased revenues and reduced costs of approximately 10 million euros of net present value (NPV) per farm, while ensuring a much faster, more streamlined, and efficient design process. Considering only the sites that Vattenfall has already acquired using our optimization tools, the company experienced NPV gains of more than 150 million euros. This has contributed substantially to its competitiveness in offshore tenders and made green energy cheaper for its end customers. The tools have also been used to design the first wind farms that will be constructed subsidy-free. © 2020 INFORMS.","Analytics; Offshore wind energy; Operations research; Sustainability; Wind farm layout",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085545464

To succeed in this endeavor, we consider it necessary to develop analytical frameworks that are sensitive to the particularities of the analyzed event, sector, and stakeholder group. In this article we focus on the academic sector and offer two connected analyses. First is an empirically grounded typology of academic events. We identify four differentiating dimensions of academic events: size, academic focus, participants, and tradition, and based on these dimensions we develop a typology of academic events that includes: congress, specialty conference, symposium, and practitioners' meeting. Secondly, we outline the academic impact of attending these four types of events. For this purpose, the concept of credibility cycles is used as an analytical framework for examining academic impact. We suggest that academic events should be conceptualized and evaluated as open marketplaces that facilitate conversion of credibility. Data were obtained from interviews with 22 researchers at three Danish universities. The study concludes that there are significant differences between the events in terms of their academic impact. Moreover, the outcome for the individual scholar depends on the investment being made.

This paper explores the use of go-along methods in complex and dynamic nature-based tourism settings. Specifically, it re-orients attention towards the collaborative and participatory processes involved when “walking the talking” of go-along methods. Based on 35 highly diverse go-alongs from the westernmost and easternmost parts of Denmark, we illuminate challenging dimensions of go-along methods. Inherent shifts towards participant led ways of engaging with nature force researchers to navigate with others as led along by others through literal and figurative unknown terrains of nature, sociality, (dis)empowerment and embodiment. Go-alongs as a co-navigating and co-learning endeavor is more than the sum of walking and talking as we continuously relate to self, others and nature. Accordingly, we coin being-along as the social and bodily navigation of unknown terrains with others.

The conflicting nature of the objectives of the problem can be modelled as a bi-objective location-routeing problem. In this paper, we address the location-routeing problem of recycling drop-off stations by solving the Maximal Covering Tour Problem. To this aim, we propose a heuristic inspired by a variable neighbourhood search. The heuristic is tested on a set of benchmark instances from the TSPLIB and applied to a set of real-life instances from both urban and rural areas in Denmark.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors investigate a sample of 281 non-financial S&P 1500 firms and a corresponding 457 CEOs in the 10-yr period 2006–2015. Findings: The association between CEO narcissism and corporate risk taking depends on the admiration, attention, and affirmation of own superiority (“narcissistic supply”) that the CEO receives given her/his current position. Thus, a narcissistic CEO with an insufficient narcissistic supply (small firm/small compensation) will crave for more and take more risks (“rock the boat”) while a narcissistic CEO with a sufficient narcissistic supply (large firm/large compensation) will protect the status quo and be reluctant to take new risks. Specifically, the authors find that a change from a slightly narcissistic CEO to a strongly narcissistic CEO, for positions entailing limited (abundant) narcissistic supply, is associated with an increase (a decrease) in corporate risk of 6%–8% (11%–27%). Originality/value: Previous research indicates a positive association between CEO narcissism and corporate risk taking in specific domains such as M&A and R&D activities. This paper provides a novel contribution to the existing literature by identifying and assessing the important role of narcissistic supply for the association between CEO narcissism and corporate risk taking in general. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral corporate finance; CEO narcissism; Corporate risk; Narcissistic supply",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083549546

However, tapping into the local knowledge of subsidiaries and transforming this into innovation capabilities remains a challenge for many multinational companies. In this paper, we aim to discuss how different approaches to the use of inter-firm objects can affect companies' abilities to obtain the subsidiaries' knowledge and utilise it to different degrees of innovation performance. For this purpose, we adopted a multiple case study approach consisting of ten multinational companies located in Denmark. Our findings show that companies use inter-firm objects to either control the flow of knowledge and subsidiaries' operations, i.e., the static use, or to create the circumstances favouring a collaborative relationship between headquarter and subsidiaries, i.e., the dynamic use.

The role of line managers (LMs), who have been deemed key players in the implementation of ambidextrous strategies, was investigated in detail. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a qualitative study based on 58 semistructured interviews with key employees, i.e. firm directors, human resource (HR) managers, LMs and their subordinates, in Colombia and Mexico over a three-year period. Findings: The “culture of insecurity” that exists in Colombia and Mexico due to narcoterrorism and the lack of governmental enactment of coercive institutional pillars defines the common frames and patterns of the beliefs held by managers and employees working in such contexts. To ensure the survival of employees and firms in unsafe institutional contexts while managing normative pressures to compete worldwide, LMs, HR departments, and ultimately firms are forced to strategically exploit security measures and simultaneously implement innovative explorative strategies. Originality/value: The findings suggest that ambidexterity strategies in unsafe institutional contexts represent an organizational advantage for competing worldwide while surviving in such contexts.

A novel typology of businesses' human rights duties ('duty' is considered synonymous with 'responsibility' here) is proposed. It claims that duties are both forward- A nd backward-looking. Cases of human rights litigation seeking remedy for climate-related harms are backward-looking, and duties should be determined on the basis of proportion of historical emissions, culpable knowledge and counter-acts to abate climate harms. Businesses' forward-looking duties, however, depend on their power, privilege, interest and collective abilities. The typology is then assessed against the background of recent legal principles and instruments. It is concluded that moral duties of business reach beyond mere respect for human rights and national jurisdictions in the context of climate change. © 2019 Cambridge University Press.","climate justice; corporate citizenship; corporate duties; historical responsibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082107317

We review the value proposition literature and then examine the relationships between 19 assertions about value propositions, as well as six stable topics that best describe the SERS corpus, which is comprised of 137 assertions about scaling companies early, rapidly, and securely. Conducting a topic model of eight topics led to six stable topics: Fundraise, Enable, Position, Communicate, Innovate, and Complement.

Doing so requires bridging the divide between determinist and interpretivist definitions of culture, which the paper accomplishes by building on Bourdieu's theoretical framework. This approach facilitates resolutions to three main criticisms of intercultural capital that emerge in light of the determinist-interpretivist divide: An overly static conceptualisation conflating culture and nation, underexplored power relations in the definition and development of intercultural competences, as well as a dearth of socio-historic contextualisation of intercultural competences.

IT has until now in many ways been regarded as exempted from the structuration and automation represented by IT. The IT4IT framework released by The Open Group in October 2015 suggests to a major change. IT has to be governed and structured along defined processes of value chains, life-cycles, service propositions, customer interaction and cost control as any other area of the organization. The purpose of this paper is to review IT4IT as a practical implementation of a Management of Technology framework and to review its perspectives and implications to the MoT society as well as the contributions it has to IT professionals, innovators and MoT practitioners. Methodologically this paper is based on an extensive case study of a large IT service provider. The IT service provider used the framework, along with other frameworks, to introduce larger degree of homogeneity of its own service “catalogues”, improved processes for navigating in the heterogeneity of its customers, and to ensure uniform processes of performance management and reporting. Methodologically this paper has been challenged by the novelty of the topic of IT4IT as only very little peer reviewed materials is available; analogue channel have thus been used. Key findings of this study are: (1) IT4IT as strong idealization of a practical MOT framework implementation especially in conversion from relative mature innovations to operational environments and life-cycle management. (2) IT4IT is driving IT further in the direction of commoditization and consumerization reducing uncertainty in IT implementation and operations and giving business stakeholders better opportunities for innovation. (3) As a MOT framework, IT4IT is taking IT a step further in being a more manageable technology with more specific definitions of services, customer expectations, relationships between innovation and operations, and transparency of processes. IT4IT suggests a highly specific and novel interpretation of innovation and operations value chains that can inspire other MOT processes. The IT4IT framework is an interesting suggestion to the MOT society for a professional framework that has gone further in governance and provides a more holistically approach than probably any earlier framework. © 2020 26th International Association for Management of Technology Conference, IAMOT 2017.

Bibliometric methods were employed to examine 313 papers published by Turkish scholars in internationally recognised journals. The results show that while Turkish EDLM scholars have predominantly published in Turkey-based journals, there has also been a substantial increase in the number of papers published in international journals in recent years. This literature is largely empirical with topical foci concentrated on issues surrounding school leadership and organisational behaviour.

The present case focus on encounters at two urban festivals: Kulturhavn (Cultural Harbur) and Smag Verden (Taste the World)—both multicultural and both initiated by the Municipality of Copenhagen. The festivals are seen as sites for ongoing dialogue and negotiation of identity and belonging. The celebration, performances, and pleasure of festivals can empower the body, break down social and cultural distance, and for a moment suspend everyday life. They are related to laughter and freedom, but can also be exclusive, alienating, and a vehicle of the inserting of the hegemonic order. The aim of the paper is to discover how the festivals work as social and material mediators of cross-cultural encounters—how they give rise to different modes of encounters and how they balance between liberation and similarities. They are both organized by the municipality of Copenhagen, who invite voluntary organizations and cultural associations every year to participate in organizing the two festivals. They both cover a broad range of cultural activities such as dance, music, food, sport, and theatre, and they share the vision of celebrating the cultural diversity of the city. We chose these two festivals in order to explore variations in the way the festivals are experienced and encountered; the focus of the analysis is on how festivals with many similarities in location and formal conditions can give rise to rather different modes of encounters. The aim of the paper is to explore how the festivals work as social and material mediators of cross-cultural encounters. How do the two festivals give rise to different modes of encounters? How do they balance between liberation and domination in a differential way? Drawing on empirical material obtained through participant observation and framed by theoretical conceptualization of cross-cultural encounters, multicultural festivals, and aesthetic politics, the paper explores embodied encounters at the two festivals. It focuses on the role of the festivals as social and material mediators of encounters and negotiation of identities. The paper concludes on the paradoxical character of the festivals, involving antagonistic embodiments of performance, pleasure, and politics. © The Author(s) 2020.","encounter; festival; multiculturalism; otherness; politics",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078483457

We contextualize this reflection piece with a stylized interpretation of CSR ""then"" (the turn of the twenty-first century) and ""now"" (2019). We then focus on two themes: CSR's meaning and its dynamics. Regarding the meaning of CSR, we indicate the advantages of our capacious CSR definition and elaborate on the underlying theorization of our CSR framework regarding corporations' need for legitimacy with their core stakeholders, societies they operate in, and regulators they are subject to. We propose that the configuration of these legitimacy relationships informs the nature and balance of implicit and explicit CSR. Turning to CSR dynamics, we build on research on the hybridization of implicit and explicit CSR and explore two underlying phenomena-explicitization and implicitization of CSR. We conceptualize explicitization as the process by which norms and rules associated with implicit CSR are adopted in explicit CSR policies, practices, and strategies. We conceptualize implicitization of CSR as the process by which norms and rules of business responsibility are informed by what were hitherto explicit CSR policies, practices, and strategies of corporations, and are built into general obligations of business. © 2020 Academy of Management.

Such communication assumes users are sufficiently aligned, not only in terms of their interests but also in terms of their emotional and cognitive states. It is not clear how this emotional and cognitive alignment is achieved for social media, given one-to-one interactions are infrequent and discussion often spans loosely connected individuals. This study argues that circadian rhythms play an important physiological role in aligning users for information-sharing, as information shared at different times of the day is likely to encounter users with common physiological states. Data are gathered from Twitter to examine patterns of sentiment and text complexity in social media, as well as how these patterns affect information-sharing. Results suggest the timing of a social media post, relative to collective patterns of sentiment and text complexity, is a better predictor of information-sharing than the sentiment and text complexity of the post itself. Put differently, information is more likely to be shared when it is posted at times of the day when other users are primed for emotion and concentration, independent of whether that posted information is itself emotional or demanding in concentration. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Circadian; Sentiment; Social media; Text complexity; Twitter",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077879764

This paper proposes an architecture for a software platform that supports experiments with multi-modal neurophysiological tools through extensible, transparent and repeatable data analysis and enables the comparison between data analysis processes to develop more robust measures.

In a study involving 15 stores and a total of 3540 shoppers, we document that only 20 percent of shoppers actually use shopping carts, while 28 percent use baskets and 51 percent use no carrying equipment. To better understand the role of carrying equipment, we collected data in a second study from 635 complete shopping trips using behavioral tracking technology and systematic sampling. We show that there is important heterogeneity in in-store behavior related to equipment and that carrying equipment is a suitable variable for segmenting shoppers. It is an objective and observable measure that consistently explains the variance in travel distance, shopping duration, store area coverage, walking speed, basket size, and shopper efficiency. We also find non-equipment trips to be least efficient, despite their popularity.

This research proposes a mechanism for pricing brokered cloud computing services that includes guaranteed computing job completion and risk-based pricing. Using a laboratory experiment with 42 participants playing the role of cloud computing clients, we compare the economic performance of the pricing mechanism under different levels of client risk informedness and job duration. The results suggest that such risk informedness plays a major role in influencing the willingness-to-pay of clients for brokered services. By investigating the heterogeneity of client risk propensity, we explain the performance differences and find an interaction effect for risk propensity and risk informedness on the willingness-to-pay of clients.

The analysis of this data could be valuable for science and medical treatment as well as for the discovery of new drugs. For this reason, the UK government established the “care.data program” in 2013. The aim of the project was to build a central nationwide database for research and policy planning. However, the processing of personal data was planned without proper public engagement. Research has suggested that IT companies—such as in the Google DeepMind deal case—had access to sensitive data and failed to comply with data protection law. Since May 2018, the government has launched the “national data opt-out” (ND opt-out) system with the hope of regaining public trust. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of significant changes in the ND opt-out, compared to the previous opt-out system. Neither in the use of secondary data, nor in the choices that patients can make. The only notorious difference seems to be in the way that these options are communicated and framed to the patients. Most importantly, according to the new ND opt-out, the type-1 opt-out option—which is the only choice that truly stops data from being shared outside direct care—will be removed in 2020. According to the Behavioral Law and Economics literature (Nudge Theory), default rules—such as the revised opt-out system in England—are very powerful, because people tend to stick to the default choices made readily available to them. The crucial question analyzed in this chapter is whether it is desirable for the UK government to stop promoting the type-1 opt-outs, and whether this could be seen as a kind of “hard paternalism.”. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Choice architectures; GDPR; Hard paternalism; ND opt-out; Nudge theory; Opt-out system; Personal data",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076763609

About a decade ago, there were only a handful of platform-driven companies operating on the market. Zipcar, BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing among them. Then Airbnb and Uber revolutionized the transportation and hospitality industries with a presence in virtually every major city. “Access over ownership” is the paradigm shift from the traditional business model that grants individuals the use of products or services without the necessity of buying them. Digital platforms, data and algorithm-driven companies as well as decentralized blockchain technologies have tremendous potential. But they are also changing the “rules of the game.” One of such technologies challenging the legal system are AI systems that will also reshape the current legal framework concerning the liability of operators, users and manufacturers. Therefore, this introductory chapter deals with explaining and describing the legal issues of some of these disruptive technologies.

The article first demonstrates how the Commission formulates guidelines which aim at offering fair levels of representation to each member state. However, comparing recruitment targets and actual staffing figures reveals very heterogeneous staff levels. Some member states enjoy unexpectedly high levels of representation whereas others present very low levels. The latter are particularly intriguing and open the door to the formulation of a ""rejection hypothesis."" This hypothesis challenges one of the foundations of the theory of representative bureaucracy and leads us to suggest that the theory be enhanced in order to take into account its context of implementation in terms of consolidated or contested statehood, which in turn may explain the phenomena of rejected offers of bureaucratic representation. ©The Author(s) 2019.

Whereas natural resource degradation has been successfully linked to weak governance, the reciprocal relationship between degradation and conflict has not been clearly established especially in sub-Saharan region where natural resource conflicts are common. This paper utilizes remote sensing and spatial techniques to examine land cover changes and conflict in light of the changing Kenyan policy and political contexts. The paper draws evidence from data collected through time series of satellite imagery for Eastern Mau forest complex between 1976 and 2014 and qualitative data including key informant interviews and observation through geo-coded transect walks. The changes in land cover and conflict intractability were analyzed in light of post-independence land use policy history of Kenya and related to conflict occurrences among Eastern Mau forest adjacent communities. The study results show that between 1976 and 2014 over 40% of forest land was converted to other uses. The study also documents both spatio-temporal drivers of conflict (e.g. forest degradation) and drivers related to political practice and competition among ethnic groupings. This paper concludes that to stem land cover changes there is need to pay greater attention to the underlying factors to land cover changes such as conflict, policy and politics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Forest policy; Land cover changes; Political ecology; Resource conflict","environmental politics; forest management; forestry policy; governance approach; land cover; resource management; spatiotemporal analysis; Kenya; Mau Forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075628064

In so doing they provided support for those within the human resource management profession who argued that there was a necessity to view human resources as strategic assets in need of a new approach to people management, namely, strategic human resource management. Similar thinking was evident in the identification of human capital as the most crucial component of intellectual capital by Edvinsson after the mid-1990s (Edvinsson, 1997; Edvinsson & Malone, 1997; Roslender & Fincham, 2001). By this time, however, customers were being touted by many observers as the key organizational asset, providing a fillip to the marketing management function and its own strategic ambitions. Like employees, customers were also identified as a key constituent of intellectual capital, forming a major part of its relational capital component. Although intellectual capital’s third generic component, structural capital, has not attracted the same level of support in respect of its value to organizations as people and customers, there has been a growing awareness of the need to recognize the role which the environment and natural capital plays in ensuring the long-term sustainability of the planet and everything that it encompasses. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075509320

These developments accentuate the role of the individual, and conversely underplay the collective effort, in the advancement of knowledge by focusing attention on metrics centered on the individual, professional performance, and communication directed at oneself. We suggest–in line with previous research–that metrics play an increasingly important role in configuring the scholarly communication system. But we also stress, unlike previous research, that metrics are embedded in larger communication contexts, or systems, that are already codified and ordered. Hence the discursive value ascribed to metrics must take into account these contexts. This has at least two benefits. One, we do not reduce scholarly communication to an issue of metrics and rewards, like scientometric studies and contemporary notions of the so-called quantified academic self, and two, a communication framework allows us to see new sorts of conversations going on and new modes of togetherness enabled alongside the digital nurturing of metric regimes. ©, Published with license by Taylor & Francis. ©, © Jack Andersen and Stine Lomborg.","Communication; digital; media; metrics; scholarly; self-tracking; theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075454424

The authors outline a model that explains how burdens and cognitive resources, especially executive functioning, interrelate. The article then presents illustrative examples, highlighting three common life factors—scarcity, health problems, and age-related cognitive decline. These factors create a human capital catch-22, increasing people's likelihood of needing state assistance while simultaneously undermining the cognitive resources required to negotiate the burdens they encounter while seeking such assistance. The result is to reduce access to state benefits and increase inequality.

The objectives of the present study were (1) to identify food socialization outcomes valued by parents, and (2) to study how parents socialize their children for (healthy) eating at home and during food shopping. Including both parents' perceptions of valued food socialization outcomes and associated processes addresses a significant gap in the food socialization literature. The study used semi-structured, in-depth interviews with parents of young children. Data were subsequently analysed by interpretive, thematic procedures. The sample consisted of middle- to high-income families from two cities in Denmark. Findings reveal four main food socialization goals valued by parents: (1) Nutrition and Health, (2) Healthy Relationship with Food, (3) Food Assimilation and (4) Self-Regulation and Autonomy. Parents prioritized children's acquisition of a healthy relationship with food which included preserving family relations and harmony, more than strictly attending a nutritious diet, contrasting the focus on the nutritional value of diet usually emphasised by public health authorities. The study therefore concludes that parents' notions of what constitutes healthy diets for their children is not completely aligned with common nutrition-oriented recommendations. Also, fathers were found to play a very active role in their children's food-related consumer socialization. The findings underline the importance of addressing the priorities and strategies of both mothers and fathers when marketers and policy makers target contemporary families regarding children's food socialization. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","children; consumer; health; marketing; parenting; socialization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075077669

One way to solve this challenge is to allocate resources to identifying and exploring new trends and opportunities emerging from the environment that may affect existing business models, and guide the development of new ones. As has been widely acknowledged, many incumbents fail at more radical business model innovation. Few studies have examined the role of cognition in this context. We suggest that differences in strategic issue identification and interpretation can help to explain the cognitive barriers that emerge when incumbent firms try to engage with radical business model innovation.

We find considerable disagreement between members of the innovation department and the core business, in this firm.

Combining the lessons of the Adidas case with evidence from other cases in which history was used to refocus and revitalize corporate brands, we deliver key recommendations for managers. © 2019 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University","Adidas; Brand identity; Brand management; Corporate brand strategy; Organizational strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073989645

Research suggests that citizens' satisfaction evaluations of public services are incomplete representations of service quality and performance. However, little attention has been given to the political nature of service evaluations. Based on the theory of (partisan) motivated reasoning and the literature on responsibility attribution, we argue that citizens provide more favorable evaluations of municipal services when the responsibility for these services is vested in political principals with matching partisanship. Drawing on original data from a two-wave pre-post panel survey of Danish voters in the 2017 municipal elections, we employ a difference-in-differences estimator to identify the effect of a partisan match between voters and elected municipal leaders on citizen satisfaction with municipal services. We furthermore nest a survey experiment in the panel survey to test whether partisan bias in citizen satisfaction emerges when the line of functional responsibility between political principals and public services is clear and not dispersed across multiple actors. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis of partisan bias in satisfaction evaluations. We further demonstrate the importance of clarity of responsibility; partisan bias seems to come into being when the functional responsibility of municipal leaders for public services is clear and not dispersed across multiple actors, pointing toward a possible mechanism of partisan bias in citizen satisfaction. ©The Author(s) 2019.

Legumes such as faba beans are underutilized protein rich sources and can be valorized as hybrid protein ingredient through dry fractionation technologies. Also, cereal side streams can be interesting sources towards multifunctional protein ingredients. The aim of this study was to assess the environmental impacts of the production of oat protein concentrate (OPC) and faba bean protein concentrate (FBC) using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and to compare the impact per kg protein to other relevant proteins. The OPC is obtained as a side stream of the beta glucan extraction process, which also produces valuable oat oil, while FBC is the only main product obtained from dehulled faba beans. Average European oat cultivation and faba bean cultivation with low and high yield were modelled. Data for protein concentrates production was from real factories who have suitable facilities, but are not currently producing concentrates commercially. The major hotspot in the carbon footprint of oat protein concentrate comes from energy consumption in processing. For faba bean protein concentrate, energy consumption in processing is lower and cultivation of faba bean is the main hotspot. The carbon footprint of oat protein concentrate is more than 50 percent lower, compared to dairy proteins per kg protein, while the carbon footprint of faba bean concentrate protein is 80–90 percent lower. Compared to legume protein sources, OPC has four times higher impacts. This is mainly due to the lower amount of processing steps needed to reach high protein content concentrates from faba beans resulting mainly from relatively lower level of lipids, which enables more energy-efficient dry separation, and high initial protein content of legumes compared to cereals. Moreover, legume cultivation requires very little nitrogen fertilizers due to symbiotic N2 fixation. This study shows that OPC and FBC have lower carbon footprints than animal protein sources. However, it should be remembered, that the environmental impacts of OPC are very sensitive to the allocation method and allocation basis. In this study economic allocation was used and prices of the different products (OPC, oat oil and beta glucan) play a key role in defining the climate impacts of OPC. © 2019",,"Artificial life; Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Land use; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen fixation; Proteins; Allocation methods; Dry fractionations; Energy efficient; Extraction process; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multifunctional protein; Protein concentrates; Protein contents; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072686008

However, the intermittent nature of these sources has become the greatest challenge for their owners, which makes the bidding in the restructured electricity market more challenging. Hence, the main goal of this paper is to propose a novel multi-objective bidding strategy framework for a wind-thermal-photovoltaic system in the deregulated electricity market for the first time. Contrary to the existing bidding models, in the proposed model, two objective functions are taken into account that the first one copes with profit maximization while the second objective function concerns with emission minimization of thermal units. The proposed multi-objective optimization problem is solved using the weighted sum approach. The uncertainties associated with electricity market prices and the output power of renewable energy sources are characterized by a set of scenarios. Ultimately, in order to select the best-compromised solution among the obtained Pareto optimal solutions, two diverse approaches are applied. The proposed bidding strategy problem is being formulated and examined in various modes of joint and disjoint operation of dispatchable and non-dispatchable energy sources. Simulation results illustrate that not only the integrated participation of these resources increases the producer's expected profit, but also decreases the amount of the produced pollution by the thermal units. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bidding strategy; Emission trading; Integrated operation; Multi-objective optimization; Weighted-sum technique; Wind-thermal-Photovoltaic system","Commerce; Deregulation; Electric industry; Electric power transmission networks; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Photovoltaic cells; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Thermal pollution; Bidding strategy; Emission trading; Integrated Operations; Photovoltaic systems; Weighted Sum; Power markets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072611872

A novel power state mathematical evaluation method is proposed in this paper by investigating the improved external parameter coupling treatment, in which the mutual relationship description is conducted by the parameter information feature decomposition together with the Bayesian sequential decision algorithm. The complicated power state evaluation model with the coupling relationship decomposition is constructed by investigating the non-convex optimization treatment under complex working conditions for the lithium battery packs. The evidence combination is realized by introducing the information fusion strategy, according to which the multi criteria decision is realized by using the evidence theory. As can be seen from the experimental results, the voltage difference is within 10 mV in both of the first and the second phases, which increases rapidly in the third phase and reaches a maximum of 120 mV. Meanwhile, its power state evaluation accuracy is 95.00% and has a good output voltage tracking effect in the complex working conditions. The power state evaluation can be realized effectively by the proposed model constructing method, which is suitable for the complex battery cell combination structures and environmental influences, protecting the reliable and hierarchical working state monitoring and management of the lithium battery packs. It provides safety protection and energy management basis for the reliable power supply in the cleaner production of the power lithium battery packs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coupling relationship model; Data modeling; Lithium battery pack; Multi-parameter optimization; Power state evaluation","Convex optimization; Data structures; Decision theory; Electric power systems; Lithium batteries; Parameter estimation; Pollution control; Combination structure; Coupling relationships; Environmental influences; Multi-parameter optimizations; Multicriteria decision; Nonconvex optimization; Power state; Reliable power supply; Battery Pack",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072554993

Suppliers, as the first layer of the supply chain network, pose a great impact on environmental pollution. Therefore, in this paper a hybrid approach of fuzzy analysis network process (FANP), fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (FDEMATEL), and multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP) models are developed for circular supplier selection and order allocation in a multi-product circular closed-loop supply chain (C-CLSC) considering multi-depot, capacitated green routing problem using heterogeneous vehicles. In this regard, a mathematical model concerning an inventory-location-routing problem is developed that minimises cost and shortage simultaneously and also deals with imposed uncertainties. A fuzzy solution approach is proposed to simultaneously incorporate uncertainty and to change the multi-objective model into a single-objective model. To motivate the practical aspect of the proposed model in real world applications, we applied the model to an automotive timing belt manufacturer.

This paper systematically reviews 130 articles with a focus on the diagnoses they provide and the directions they offer strategists regarding the role of new media in strategy. The analysis identifies four main ways of conceptualizing new media in the literature: as forces in an increasingly turbulent strategic environment; as changing the role of strategists; as tools for strategically engaging stakeholders; and as both increasing and decreasing the control necessary for strategy making. These conceptualizations are based on often-implicit assumptions about ‘agency’ in strategy: new media are seen either as forces influencing strategy or as tools in the hands of humans, who are portrayed as the agents of strategy. In both cases, new media are black-boxed, such that their specific properties and ways of becoming embedded in particular contexts are rarely examined. After discussing these assumptions and a limited number of studies that challenge them, the paper develops an approach to strategy and new media based on a relational understanding of agency, an attention to technological affordances and a methodological sensitivity to tracing strategy-making assemblages of human and non-human elements. We argue that future research based on this approach will advance our knowledge of strategy making in ways that do not take new media for granted and ways that are attentive to different kinds of agency. © 2019 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070758544

Historically, the ideal worker was a man with a stay-at-home wife, and the ideal worker devoted long hours to their jobs. Our clinging to the ideal worker norms of industrial society when we talk about “going to work” is therefore paradoxical, as more and more work is now an activity that takes place all the time for many people. The Life Navigation concept punctures the idea that work is something that only can take place at the office during regular business hours. The employees are set free from their own and colleagues’ confining expectations, and are given the opportunity to design their own schedule and work location. The time battle in the industrial society was about work time and free time. The new time battle requires that we find new ways to break with the old concept of “9 to 5” work. The new time battle is about working in sync with your inner, biological clock.

Although external resources are arguably essential to achieve resilience, little is known how and when firms' social capital derived from interorganizational relationships can lead to supply chain resilience. Therefore, we investigate the role of absorptive capacity and marketing-supply chain management alignment in realizing the potential impact of social capital on supply chain resilience. Using data obtained from dual respondents from 265 Turkish firms, we test the mediating role of absorptive capacity and the moderating role of marketing-supply chain management alignment. Our findings indicate absorptive capacity mediates the relationship between social capital and supply chain resilience, and the links between social capital and absorptive capacity and social capital and supply chain resilience are stronger when marketing-supply chain management alignment is high. We also find that supply chain resilience is positively associated with organizational performance, empirically supporting the proposed value of supply chain resilience for firm strategy. Accordingly, our paper highlights that both absorptive capacity and marketing-supply chain management alignment are necessary to realize the actual value of social capital for supply chain resilience and ensuing performance. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Absorptive capacity; Marketing-supply chain management alignment; Social capital; Supply chain resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065769562

But, do they make decisions like expert entrepreneurs? Effectuation theory describes entrepreneurial decision-making, it has been popular in entrepreneurship research for the last two decades, but still underexplored in contexts such as established company's decision-making. Therefore, this study answers the question of which factors affect the use of effectuation in established companies. Furthermore, the current use of the start-up decision-making principle is investigated. The research results show a higher use of effectuation over causation (alternative mechanism) in established companies. However, decision-making principles like ""Mean orientation"" and ""Contingency orientation"" are still dominated by causation. Identified factors for implementing effectuation in established companies are divided into six categories. In particular, effectuation requires a high flexibility and willingness to change goals. Using the already available means and resources of a company to pursue new goals, is another argument for using effectuation. Additionally, a more open and transparent culture, encouraging the identification and admittance of mistakes, also supports the use of effectuation. Based on this research, established companies should be able to understand better on which factors the implementation of effectuation depends and where it makes sense to use it. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","affordable-loss orientation; causation; contingency orientation; decision-making principles; Effectuation; established companies; means orientation; uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059653849

The matheuristic benefits from the diversification produced by a metaheuristic and the intensification from mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The initial solution provided by a multistart heuristic is used to seed and accelerate the MILP in which a local branching framework and the separation of k-path inequalities are suitably combined.

Building on the interactive framing perspective, I ask how internal activists develop a framing of their company’s responsibilities as they attempt to transform its business practices from the inside out. I explore this question in the context of a Danish pharmaceutical company’s responsibilities regarding the rising diabetes problem. Grounded in an inductive, interpretive analysis, I show how internal activists developed a framing of the company’s responsibility over time and eventually instigated new ways of thinking about and doing business in their organization. I theorize the constitutive processes that strengthened frame alignment and allowed the internal activists to shape business practices. My study contributes to the literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication by explaining how intraorganizational processes of meaning making may constitute more responsible business practices and by explicating the distinct role of internal activists as agents of organizational transformation. © The Author(s) 2018.","corporate responsibility; corporate responsibility communication; frame alignment; interactive framing; internal activists",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052297728

This article examines how academic sustainability centres try to overcome barriers to integration by achieving technical, cultural and political fit with their environment (Ansari et al. in Acad Manag Rev 35(1):67–92; Ansari et al., Academy of Management Review 35(1):67–92, 2010). Based on survey and interview data, we theorise that technical, cultural and political fit are intricately related, and that these interrelations involve legitimacy, resources and collaboration effects. Our findings about sustainability centres offer novel insights on integrating sustainable business education given the interrelated nature of different types of fit and misfit. We further contribute to the literature on fit by highlighting that incompatibility between strategies to achieve different types of fit may act as a source of dynamism. © 2018, The Author(s).","Academic centres; Fit; Sustainable business education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049662882

Strategic interaction among fishers and nations exploiting fishery resources is an inescapable fact of life. This has long been recognized at the international level, and is becoming increasingly recognized at the national/regional level. It follows, therefore, that, in order to be able to analyse effectively the management of these resources, the theory of strategic interaction ̶ game theory ̶ must be brought to bear. In this book the step-by-step development of the game theory is accompanied by numerous applications to the real world of fisheries management policy. As such, it is designed to appeal to policy makers and stakeholders, as well as to graduate students in Economics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.
