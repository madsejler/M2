Design/methodology/approach: This study performs structural equation modeling using AMOS on survey data collected from 200 Turkish firms operating in multiple industries and sectors. Findings: This study finds that leadership in Turkish firms operating in multiple sectors is positively associated with SQM. This study further finds that SQM positively influences Turkish firms’ TTC and mediates the roles of SP and leadership in TTC. Research limitations/implications: A key research implication from this study relates to the mediating role of SQM in TTC in an emerging economy context. This study highlights that SP and leadership can play an essential role in TTC through the mediating mechanism of SQM. Consequently, SQM emerges as a crucial linking pin in conveying the impact of quality management practices on technology transfer in emerging markets. Practical implications: An essential managerial implication of this study relates to the critical roles of leadership, SP and SQM in TTC. For the managers of firms operating in a relatively uncertain emerging context such as Turkey, it is essential to adopt a supportive and empowering leadership style, where open communication and innovative activities are viewed positively and SQM is adopted holistically. Also, SP should be streamlined throughout the firm and followed by SQM to support TTC. Originality/value: This paper links the technology (and knowledge) management and the strategy and leadership literature streams by focusing on the mechanisms of technology transfer and delving into the linkages between SQM, leadership, SP and TTC. It specifically presents SP and leadership as precursors to SQM in their joint influence on TTC. Accordingly, this research bridges technology, strategy and leadership research and provides a broader picture of technology transfer that encompasses the joint role of different processes in firms’ TTC. © 2022, Gulin Idil Sonmezturk Bolatana, Ismail Golgeci, Ahmad Arslan, Ekrem Tatoglu, Selim Zaim and Sitki Gozlu.","Leadership; Strategic planning; Strategic quality management; Technology transfer competence; Turkish firms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128399677

The authors analyze the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the specific context of B2B relationship initiation and customer relationship management dynamics by examining Finnish B2B industrial microenterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses exploratory in-depth case studies undertaken in three Finnish industrial microenterprises to analyze the influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on their new business relationship initiation and relationship management with the current customers. Findings: The case firms quickly adjusted to the “new normal” and used a number of technological resources, including online meetings and three-dimensional demonstrations, among others. A key reason for this quick adjustment was them being microenterprises. However, despite this, lack of access to customer sites remained a hindrance as their products need to fit certain production processes, which cannot be done without physical visits. Furthermore, the development of trust with new customers, especially those based in emerging markets, was challenging due to the lack of physical meetings and site visits. Research limitations/implications: The research highlights the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to B2B relationships and gives an account of the changing dynamics of relationship initiation and customer relationship management amid technological and societal disruptions. It also highlights the continued role of personal relationships and psychical meetings in such relationships. As such, the research informs B2B research that examines the role of personal relationships in B2B marketing. Practical implications: The study offers industrial microenterprise executives insights into how to face and tackle COVID-19 driven challenges in B2B customer relationship management and how to integrate technological tools in relationship management practices while understanding where face-to-face meetings are indispensable. Originality/value: The study demonstrates areas in which virtual tools can and cannot be substitutes for conventional means of B2B relationship initiation and customer relationship management across developed and emerging markets.

Along with analysing CSOs’ management dynamics at a general level, it also offers specific insights into their management strategies in response to COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a qualitative research design, where in-depth case studies are undertaken with four CSOs operating in post-conflict volatile Sub-Saharan African economies of Liberia and Sierra Leone. Findings: Findings revealed that multiple stakeholder management plays an important role in social value creation by CSOs. The findings further state that, in volatile contexts, CSOs appear to have more legitimacy than state functionaries due to their capabilities in dealing with political pressures and conflict sensitivities. The findings also revealed that case CSOs operating in Liberia and Sierra Leone were quick to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by adjusting their working routines accordingly by switching to online working where possible and repurposing their management strategies. This repurposing of management strategies focussed on minimising economic disruptions caused by COVID-19 and continuing to create social value by helping youth and farmers particularly.

Despite a growing body of research on blockchain-based technologies, the relationship between these two mechanisms for supply chains remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims at addressing this research gap and explaining their interaction. We described and assessed 16 cases of blockchain-based technologies and voluntary sustainability standards against twelve sustainability-related assessment criteria. The results show that the relationship between blockchain-based technologies and voluntary sustainability standards can be co-existing, synergistic, and antagonistic. While most cases fall under the co-existing relationship, we identified a few cases with synergistic relationships, and one case with an antagonistic relationship. We explain each type of relation and show how the system architecture and goal of a blockchain-based technology implementation are key determinants of this relationship. This study can support stakeholders in agro-food supply chain in better understanding the application of blockchain-based technologies for sustainability governance in relation to existing voluntary sustainability standards. It can further inform those stakeholders of possibilities to constructively collaborate and focus on positive social and environmental impacts within agro-food supply chains. © 2022 The Authors","Blockchain technology; Ecolabels; Supply chain governance; Sustainability; Voluntary sustainability standards","Blockchain; Environmental impact; Food supply; Supply chains; Agro foods; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Co-existing; Ecolabels; Food supply chain; Governance mechanisms; Growing bodies; Supply chain governances; Voluntary sustainability standard; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85140141821

However, serious concerns over the ecologically and environmentally friendly development of IRCF are still growing. Despite its importance, there is no comprehensive assessment study of IRCF to evaluate if it is a green and sustainable development in agricultural sector. To address such concerns, the life cycle assessment method at the endpoint level and water footprint were employed to elucidate the potential environmental risk caused by the fast development of IRCF. Furthermore, the economic assessment was also carried out using cost-benefit analysis. The results showed that, IRCF systems have higher impacts in the human health damage category compared to rice monoculture (RM) systems. This was attributed to the higher direct field emissions such as methane emission and high-water consumption in IRCF. However, IRCF had lower environmental impacts in the ecosystem damage category than RM, primarily due to decreased fertilizer inputs. Water footprint was the primary concern in IRCF, with 379% higher water consumption than RM. The expansion of IRCF can affect food security for the following two reasons: i) Outer ridge and ditch that are built around rice fields decrease rice planting area and hence total production, ii) Crayfish occupy rice fields in winter and the following spring, so winter-season crops such as winter wheat cannot be grown in IRCF fields. Economic assessment approved that the gross profit is the main motivation for farmers to shift from RM to IRCF, where 297% higher economic benefit can be achieved. Our results indicated that IRCF expansion improved farmers’ income but came with potentially environmental and food security risks. Therefore, strict measures and rational land use planning should be implemented for the sustainable development of IRCF. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Crayfish; Paddy fields; Rice; Sustainable agriculture","Air; Cost benefit analysis; Crops; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Food supply; Fruits; Land use; Life cycle; Planning; Risk assessment; Shellfish; Comprehensive assessment; Crayfish; Economic assessments; Farming system; High water; Paddy fields; Rice; Sustainable agriculture; Water consumption; Water footprint; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139423645

Lyngby2800, Denmark","The injection of seawater into a hydrocarbon reservoir (seawater flooding) as a secondary or tertiary oil recovery method is associated with two possibly significant challenges. First, the formation and deposition of various types of scale may happen due to incompatibility between the injection seawater and formation brine. Especially, the addition of sulfate ions may trigger the formation of various types of sulfate scales (e.g., barium sulfate, strontium sulfate, and calcium sulfate). Second, microbial reservoir souring may happen due to the activation of Sulfate Reducing Bacteria (SRBs), which reduce sulfate ions to hydrogen sulfide. This is mainly a result of a drop in temperature in the reservoir, the addition of sulfate from the seawater to the reservoir, and the presence of Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) coming from reservoir hydrocarbon. Since both these processes include the consumption of sulfate ions, a competition is expected to happen between them. Especially, there is a concern about whether an efficient mitigation strategy for souring (e.g., nitrate treatment) will result in less consumption of sulfate ions and in turn more formation of sulfate scales. This study tests this theory and investigates the effect of souring intensity and mitigation on the severity of barite scale formation inside the reservoir. In this study, a non-isothermal multi-component bio-chemical model to simultaneously simulate both the processes is developed. Several simulation cases in one and two dimensions are investigated in different conditions in order to study the effect of three influential parameters, namely sulfate ion concentration in the injection sweater, the DOC content of the reservoir hydrocarbon, and injection flow rate on barite scale formation, microbial reservoir souring, nitrate treatment, and the interplay among them. The results show that the effect of barite scale formation on reservoir souring is small (a maximum of 4 percent reduction in the total generated hydrogen sulfide) whereas reservoir souring and nitrate treatment significantly influence barite formation. Depending on the case, the presence of souring can cause a complete removal of barite scale especially around the production well (positive effect) or a maximum of 8 times increase in barite scale amount around the production well (negative effect). Moreover, in all cases, with a more efficient nitrate treatment, although less hydrogen sulfide is generated inside the reservoir (up to a full removal of souring), the generation zone moves closer to the production well. Therefore, an insufficient nitrate treatment may cause an earlier hydrogen sulfide production from the production well (up to twice as early). Several other trends observed in the set of results are also presented in this paper. © 2022 The Authors","Barium sulfate scale; Hydrogen sulfide; Nitrate treatment; Reservoir modelling; Sulfate reducing bacteria","Bacteria; Barium sulfate; Calcium compounds; Hydrocarbons; Ions; Nitrates; Oil well flooding; Organic carbon; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Seawater; Strontium compounds; Barite scale; Barium sulphate scale; Dissolved organic carbon; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Nitrate treatments; Production wells; Reservoir models; Scale formation; Sulphate ion; Sulphate reducing bacteria; Hydrogen sulfide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139336241

This makes local policies more important in mitigating climate change, and calls for efficient tools allowing local decision makers to measure the impact of urban areas under their control. This study introduces a parsimonious screening tool to cater to this need and allow local governments to gauge and monitor consumption-based climate change footprint of cities. The tool consists of multiple-regression models that operate on easily accessible city data. To demonstrate its applicability, the per capita climate change footprint is estimated for 949 cities. Australian cities are found to have the highest per-capita footprint, averaging 20.4 t CO2-eq, while South American cities have the lowest per-capita footprint, averaging 8.1 t CO2-eq. The results are evaluated against IPCC climate change mitigation pathways to judge which cities are on track to an absolute sustainable level of greenhouse gas emissions. Few cities are found to be on track to comply with the necessary levels for 2030, and the findings thus substantiate that cities all over the planet need major actions to comply with the required climate change mitigation. © 2022 The Authors","Climate change footprint; Consumption-scope; Multiple regression models; Sustainability screening; Sustainable cities","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regression analysis; Climate change footprint; Climate change mitigation; Consumption-scope; Greenhouse gas emissions; Local decisions; Local policies; Multiple regression modelling; Per capita; Sustainability screening; Sustainable cities; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139286109

Excess returns are primarily driven by expectation errors, whereas term premia are negligible. Investors face challenges when learning about the Federal Reserve's response to large, but infrequent, negative shocks in real-time. Rather than reflecting risk compensation, excess returns stem from investors underestimating how much the central bank eases policy in response to such rare shocks.

This may be the result of different geospatial configurations of the natural environment and confounding characteristics of the study population. Thus, we investigated how the relationship between the natural environment and mental health, muscular fitness, and physical activity varies depending on the geospatial configuration of nature and children’s and adolescents’ characteristics. Methods: Data were derived from the German Motorik-Modul (MoMo) cohort study (2018–2020) that investigates physical activity, muscular fitness, and health parameters in a national sample of children and adolescents (N = 2843) between four and 17 years (Mage = 10.46 ± 3.49 years; 48.3% girls). Mental health was assessed via questionnaire, muscular fitness via standing long jump, and physical activity with 7-day accelerometer measurement. Using geographic information systems, land cover, and land use data, three different nature definitions were applied. Both circular buffers (100–1000 m) and street-network buffers (1000–5000 m) were created for each of the nature definitions. Associations were explored with linear regression models, and interaction analysis was used to investigate how those relationships vary by gender, age, and socio-economic status. Results: The relationship between the three outcomes and the natural environment varied considerably depending on the nature definition, buffer size, and buffer type, as well as socio-demographic characteristics. Specifically, when comparing youth with a high socio-economic status to those with a medium socio-economic status, smaller circular buffer distances were related to less physical activity, but larger street-network buffer distances were related to greater mental health problems. Distinct relationships also occurred for youth with low socio-economic status in those relationships, with the pattern being less clear. Conclusions: For future health research studies that investigate the role of the natural environment, we argue for the development of an a-priori model that integrates both geospatial considerations (nature definition, buffer type, and buffer size) and conceptual considerations (health outcome/behavior, sample characteristics) based on potentially underlying mechanisms that link the natural environment and the health outcome or behavior under investigation to theoretically underpin the geospatial configuration of the natural environment. © 2022, The Author(s).","Blue space; Cohort study; GIS; Green space; Mental health; Physical activity; Physical fitness; Youth","adolescence; child health; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; GIS; greenspace; mental health; physical activity; public health; spatial analysis; adolescent; child; cohort analysis; environment; exercise; female; health behavior; human; male; Adolescent; Child; Cohort Studies; Environment; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment, Health Care",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135861506

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one example of a highly impactful macro-level shock that significantly affected demand patterns and required manual intervention from airline analysts. Smaller, micro-level shocks also frequently occur due to special events or changes in competition. Despite their importance, shock detection methods employed by airlines today are often quite rudimentary in practice. In this paper, we develop a science-based shock detection framework based on statistical hypothesis testing which enables fast detection of demand shocks. Under simplifying assumptions, we show how the properties of the shock detector can be expressed in analytical closed form and demonstrate that this expression is remarkably accurate even in more complex environments. Simulations are used to show how the shock detector can successfully be used to identify positive and negative shocks in both demand volume and willingness-to-pay. Finally, we discuss how the shock detector could be integrated into an airline revenue management system to allow for practical use by airline analysts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Airline revenue management; Change point detection; Demand forecast error; Demand shock; Forecasting; Markov decision process",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135519512

An inherent challenge for the technology licensing of universities is that potential licensees find it difficult to judge the early stage technologies and their ultimate commercial value. We reason that patent litigation against universities can have unintended signaling effects about the commercial value of its technologies and results in increased licensing income for the university. We ground this hypothesis in theory integrating signaling mechanisms from patent enforcement research into theoretical models explaining university technology licensing. Within our logic, the public and costly nature of patent litigation against universities creates strong, credible signals to potential licensees about the technologies of a university even if the signal was not created for that specific purpose. We isolate the signaling mechanism that is central to our theorizing by exploring two moderation factors that reveal additional information to potential licensees, i.e. the licensing track-record of the university and whether the lawsuit involves private firms as co-defendants. We test our theory with a unique dataset of 157 US universities and the 1408 patent infringement cases in which they were involved as defendants over the period 2005–2016. Results show that defending against claims of patent infringement enhances technology licensing revenues, particularly when universities are already adept at licensing technology and when they are co-defendants with private firms. © 2022 The Authors","Commercialization; Licensing; Patent litigation; Signaling theory; University technology transfer","Patents and inventions; Signaling; Statistical tests; Commercialisation; Licensing; Patent infringements; Patent litigation; Signaling theory; Signalling mechanisms; Technology licensing; Theoretical modeling; Track record; University technology transfer; Technology transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134803112

In particular, (i) the SSH have too often been sidelined and/or narrowly pigeonholed by policymakers, funders, and other decision-makers when driving research agendas, and (ii) the setting of SSH-focused research agendas has not historically embedded inclusive and deliberative processes. The aim of this paper is to address these gaps through the production of a research agenda outlining future SSH research priorities for energy efficiency. A Horizon Scanning exercise was run, which sought to identify 100 priority SSH questions for energy efficiency research. This exercise included 152 researchers with prior SSH expertise on energy efficiency, who together spanned 62 (sub-)disciplines of SSH, 23 countries, and a full range of career stages. The resultant questions were inductively clustered into seven themes as follows: (1) Citizenship, engagement and knowledge exchange in relation to energy efficiency; (2) Energy efficiency in relation to equity, justice, poverty and vulnerability; (3) Energy efficiency in relation to everyday life and practices of energy consumption and production; (4) Framing, defining and measuring energy efficiency; (5) Governance, policy and political issues around energy efficiency; (6) Roles of economic systems, supply chains and financial mechanisms in improving energy efficiency; and (7) The interactions, unintended consequences and rebound effects of energy efficiency interventions. Given the consistent centrality of energy efficiency in policy programmes, this paper highlights that well-developed SSH approaches are ready to be mobilised to contribute to the development, and/or to understand the implications, of energy efficiency measures and governance solutions. Implicitly, it also emphasises the heterogeneity of SSH policy evidence that can be produced. The agenda will be of use for both (1) those new to the energy-SSH field (including policyworkers), for learnings on the capabilities and capacities of energy-SSH, and (2) established energy-SSH researchers, for insights on the collectively held futures of energy-SSH research. © 2022, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133120316

Based on a large-scale online survey (N = 4630) conducted in three European countries, we demonstrate that COVID-19 anxiety triggered assortative sociality, which reflects both xenophobic and ethnocentric traits. This changes perceptions of domestic and international travel attractiveness, and further leads to travel choices prioritizing domestic destinations. At the same time, xenophobic and ethnocentric traits also affected citizen attitudes towards supporting the domestic tourism industry ‒ an industry that accommodates foreigners.

Analyzing a large firm-level data set on Chinese manufacturing firms during 2000–2007, we find that state ownership has a positive moderating effect on the innovation–export relationship. We ascribe this effect to state-owned firms’ privileged access to complementary resources and networks that strengthen their ability to use innovation to generate exports. In contrast to many earlier studies, we also find that foreign ownership has a negative moderating effect. One likely reason is that indicators of local innovation do not reflect the flows of knowledge between foreign-owned firms and their parent companies. This finding highlights the fact that innovation and production may be geographically separated within multinational enterprises. A policy implication of the analysis is that public support to innovation is likely to have stronger effects on exports when it targets firms that carry out most of their activities in domestic market. © 2022 The Authors","China; Export performance; Foreign ownership; Innovation; State ownership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132822227

The weighted travel time depends on the free route choice of passengers. Passenger route choice depends on the timetable. In turn, the timetable that minimizes weighted travel time depends on the route choice of passengers—and therefore requires passenger route choice information. Consequently, a sequential approach where timetables are designed provided pre-fixed passenger assignment to routes may not find the optimal timetable. This paper aims to integrate passenger route choice and timetabling. It addresses the problem of designing maximal passenger service public transport timetables in systems with free route choice within a budget for operating costs. Operating costs are defined by the minimal cost vehicle schedule required to operate the timetable. The proposed methodology integrates a matheuristic for timetabling and vehicle scheduling with a passenger assignment model in an iterative framework, where different forms of integration are evaluated. Focus is on long- to medium-term timetabling, provided an initial timetable. The results for a realistic case study in the Greater Copenhagen area indicate that our approach consistently leads, at no additional cost, to timetables that represent a reduction in passenger weighted travel time in comparison with both an initial timetable and a non-integrated timetabling method that receives a single-passenger assignment as input. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bus timetabling; Matheuristic; Mixed integer linear programming; Passenger route choice; Public transport",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132613421

Governments around the world provide considerable financial support to mitigate the economic downturn. However, effective policy responses require reliable data on the economic consequences of the corona pandemic. We propose the CoRisk-Index: a real-time economic indicator of corporate risk perceptions related to Covid-19. Using data mining, we analyse all reports from US companies filed since January 2020, representing more than a third of the US workforce. We construct two measures—the number of ‘corona’ words in each report and the average text negativity of the sentences mentioning corona in each industry—that are aggregated in the CoRisk-Index. The index correlates with U.S. unemployment rates across industries and with an established market volatility measure, and it preempts stock market losses of February 2020. Moreover, thanks to topic modelling and natural language processing techniques, the CoRisk data provides highly granular data on different dimensions of the crisis and the concerns of individual industries. The index presented here helps researchers and decision makers to measure risk perceptions of industries with regard to Covid-19, bridging the quantification gap between highly volatile stock market dynamics and long-term macroeconomic figures.

The article makes three main contributions to the existing literature. First, it reveals a pervasive inconsistency in the use of norms across HRM research such that any assumption of a “norm of norms”—that is, consensus on the meaning of norms in HRM—is erroneous and in need of critical reflection. Second, the review offers a typology that outlines four similarities and differences in how HRM research employs norms. Finally, the authors propose a norm-critical research agenda as a relevant basis for future critical and reflexive enquiry into norms in both HRM theory and practice. © 2021 The Authors","Culture; Diversity; Labor market; Norm-critique; Norms; Systematic literature review; Work–life",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115056892

However, this interest has been met with concerns that the effects of leadership are overestimated compared to other relevant organizational factors. In this article, we explore the relative importance of formal, vertical leadership, specifically transformational leadership, and horizontal relations, that is, the internal team relations, for different employee outcomes and user satisfaction. We argue that both factors may work through public service motivation (PSM). Based on survey data collected in Danish nursing homes linked with a user satisfaction survey and employee sickness absence data, we find that the internal team relations have the strongest association with some outcome measures, whereas others are more substantially related to vertical leadership. We further find that the relationship between transformational leadership and these outcome measures is fully mediated by PSM, whereas this is not the case with the internal team relations. © The Author(s) 2021.","job satisfaction; leadership; performance; public service motivation; teams",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105493904

Existing GNN pruning methods simultaneously prune the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights on a pretrained neural network by directly leveraging the lottery-ticket hypothesis, but the benefits of such methods are mainly via weight pruning, and methods based on saliency metrics struggle to outperform random pruning when pruning only the graph adjacency matrix. This motivates us to use different scoring standards for graph edges and network weights during GNN pruning. Thus, rather than measuring the importance of graph edges based on saliency metrics, we formulate the performance of GNNs mathematically with respect to the properties of their edges, elucidating how the performance drop can be avoided by pruning negative edges and nonbridges. This leads to our simple but effective two-step method for GNN pruning, leveraging the saliency metrics for the network pruning while sparsifying the graph with preservation of the loss performance. Experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method on both small-scale graph datasets (Cora, Citeseer, and PubMed) and a large-scale dataset (Ogbn-ArXiv), where our method saves up to 98% of floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) on the small graphs and 94% of FLOPs on the large one, with no significant drop in accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Graph neural networks; Model compression; Network pruning","Digital arithmetic; Drops; Large dataset; Edge properties; Floating point operations per seconds; Graph adjacency matrices; Graph edges; Graph neural networks; Model compression; Network pruning; Performance; Pruning methods; Saliency metric; Graph neural networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138100842

This has been scarcely researched hitherto; therefore, a participatory action research approach is used to reveal essential phenomena emerging in collaboration with research participants. An extended approach for innovation ecosystems to create value in society is hereby revealed beyond the coordination done by a focal firm or a platform, as noted in previous research. The study was conducted from September 2017 to June 2018 in a port in the Baltic Sea. Four enterprises participated in representing complementary activities for value creation in the pre-phases of establishing a new offshore wind park within the wind-energy innovation ecosystem. The findings are summarised using in the ‘EcoValue BMI’ model. The findings highlight the essential role of value proposition in innovation ecosystems in focusing and structuring the direction of complementary independent initiatives for value creation, as noted in the middle of the model. All participating enterprises could identify the overall ecosystem value proposition. This insight into the overall value proposition is realised by organising collaborative business model innovation (BMI) to set horizontal innovation directions for exploration and exploitation of interfaces and flow among ecosystem participants for cleaner energy production. Further research is required to verify and enhance the ‘EcoValue BMI’ findings through new research conducted in similar large innovation ecosystems without a focal firm or a platform to coordinate the innovation ecosystem for value creation in society. © 2022 The Author",,"Offshore oil well production; Wind power; Business model innovation; Clean energy; Cleaner energies; Energy productions; Exploration and exploitation; Innovation models; Off-shore wind parks; Participatory action research approaches; Value creation; Value proposition; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139057621

It considers both the energy efficiencies of the processes and their potential to be integrated into future fossil free energy systems. The model provides a general framework for converting experimental results and process simulation to higher level techno-economic- and life-cycle analysis in a comparable manner. In this study the performance of six technology pathways from three different categories; direct liquefaction, power-to-X, and gas-to-liquid, were evaluated. The results showed that from a socio-economic perspective investment into renewable electricity and hydrogen production were the dominating factors. This resulted in the direct liquefaction options being both the cheapest and most energy efficient while the power-to-X options were the most expensive and less efficient. On the other hand, the extensive use of hydrogen in power-to-X and gas-to-liquid pathways allows for a high utilization of the carbon content in the biomass. © 2022 The Authors","Direct liquefaction; Energy system integration; Gas to liquid; Lignocellulosic biomass; Power to X; Sustainable fuel","Energy efficiency; Free energy; Fuels; Hydrogen production; Investments; Life cycle; Liquefaction; Liquids; Direct liquefaction; Energy system integration; Energy systems; Fuel production; Gas to liquids; Lignocellulosic biomass; Power; Power to X; Sustainable fuels; System integration; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139019340

The present study evaluates whether access to electricity helps decline poverty in developing countries. For this purpose, the impact of access to electricity on the total population, rural and urban populations on poverty have been analyzed from 1990 to 2020 in 82 developing countries. Empirical results are obtained through the non-linear Panel ARDL approach. The results show that rural and urban population's access to electricity to the total population proposes the inverted U-shaped relationship with poverty. As a result, increased access to electricity initially contributes to poverty but eventually causes it to reduce. Based on these findings, the study suggests that in order to combat poverty, the countries with poor access to electricity should grant everyone easy and affordable access to power. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Developing countries; Electricity; Non-linear ARDL; Poverty; Sustainable development goal","Planning; Sustainable development; Developing economies; Energy; Non linear; Non-linear ARDL; Poverty; Poverty reduction; Rural and urban; Rural population; Sustainable development goal; Urban population; Developing countries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138475998

A new strategy is proposed in this paper that integrates technological capabilities and supply chain management initiatives to overcome this challenge. The technological capabilities equip the supply chain with a regenerative process to reuse the expired products in other products. On the other hand, to facilitate and optimize the application of the technology, the integration and coordination techniques of the supply chain are employed. This innovation is in accordance with the zero-waste concept arising in the circular economy era and circular supply chain. The paper focuses on integrating a supply chain consisting of one retailer and one manufacturer and developing a new buy-back coordination mechanism to provide enough incentives for the cooperation of members and encourage them to participate in the regenerating operations. It is proved that the proposed strategy is economically feasible if and only if the revenue of each unit of reused product in addition to the saving on its disposing cost, is greater than its reprocessing cost. Furthermore, it is shown that an integrated supply chain equipped with the mentioned technology earns more than one that only benefits the integrated decisions of the whole supply chain.

The aim of this work is to perform that comparison so it can serve as a guide for decision making by future investors as well as set future research needs that can improve the technology. Assuming production in Brazil from sugarcane ethanol, technoeconomic and lifecycle assessments were performed from process simulations, and the reliability of the results was studied with uncertainty analyses. The comparison reveals that the one-step process should be preferred because of its better economic and environmental performance. Biobutadiene from ethanol is not cost competitive against naphtha-derived butadiene (probability of positive net present value is 11–17% for one-step process scenarios and 5% for the two-step process scenarios) but producing biobutadiene from ethanol in Brazil leads to significant reductions in emissions of CO2 compared to naphtha-derived butadiene (102–103% and 7.6–52.4% for one- and two-step process scenarios, respectively). A critical issue for the cost competitiveness of biobutadiene is that the CO2 saved can be sold in an international carbon emission trading market. In that case, the one-step processes would be much more favored. Future research is needed concerning the development of highly selective two-step catalysts operating in less energy-demanding conditions so that two-step processes can compete with one-step processes. © 2022 The Authors","Bioethanol; Butadiene; Economic assessment; Lifecycle assessment; One-step process; Two-step process","Bioethanol; Butadiene; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Environmental management; Ethanol; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Bio-ethanols; Conversion process; Economic and environmental performance; Economic assessments; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); One-step process; Reaction steps; Two-step process; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137630441

The ‘user’ of such a device is deemed to be the only possible controller, regardless of whether the processing falls under the household exemption or not. This is because the concept is understood more narrowly than its actual definition permits. However, in particular the development of ‘smart’ devices with ‘local’ or ‘edge’ computing upends the assumption that device manufacturers automatically fall outside the scope of the GDPR. Device manufacturers may often have sufficient influence on the processing to be deemed ‘controllers’, even where personal data is processed on-device only without any direct processing by the manufacturer. This is because device manufacturers may in certain cases ‘determine the means and purposes of the processing’. This expanded understanding of the concept of controllership is supported by CJEU and Supervisory Authority case law and an interpretation of the GDPR which should be adopted by practitioners, authorities, and courts.

Specifically, we investigate what drives the use of the dominating (win-lose) conflict management approach by parties in buyer-supplier conflicts, and how the sequence and types of conflict management approaches employed throughout the process affect whether it is managed in a functional or dysfunctional manner. Existing studies often focus on one-sided, one-stage conflicts which may not reflect the true process of conflict management. This qualitative study analyses the historical e-mail correspondences between a small retailer and five of its suppliers, allowing for an exploration of authentic conflict management processes. We develop a two-sided, multi-stage process model that outlines the drivers that promote the use of dominating approaches throughout the conflict, and considers the initial and subsequent actions by both parties that lead to a (dys)functional conflict process. It demonstrates that dysfunctional conflicts are those that end with either party employing a dominating approach. This suggests that even if dominating approaches are employed throughout the conflict process, the conflict may not escalate, and is therefore managed in a functional manner. © 2022","Buyer-supplier relationships; Case study; Conflict; Conflict management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139732710

However, integrating different elements of environmental justice in PPGIS research is still in its infancy, especially in regards to the deep and less visible issues related to recognition and participation of different groups in local green space planning and management. Here we present a new method for assessing perceived recognition and procedural justice with respect to UGBS in the Amager island of Copenhagen, Denmark. We collected survey data together with 2187 place-based values and preferences from 298 local residents. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis, we classified respondents in four clusters representing low to high perceived recognition and procedural justice. We then examined how these clusters relate to socio-demographics and the spatial distribution of mapped values and preferences. Results indicated no significant differences in terms of income and age between clusters. However, there was clear variation in the spatial distribution and type of values and preferences respondents from different clusters assigned, particularly for those who feel unrecognized and do not participate in local environmental decision-making compared to all other groups. In addition, gender had a significant effect on the perceptions of recognition and procedure. Female respondents scored lower on procedural justice than male and mapped landscape values and preferences closer to home than males, thus suggesting that gender inequalities can be deeply embedded in everyday public spaces and practices. Planning inclusive and environmentally just UGBS requires not only incorporating such gender perspectives, but a more flexible, intersectional and relational understanding of space that reflects the everyday needs of different and marginalized groups. © 2022","Distributional justice; Environmental justice; Green spaces; Nature-based solutions; Participatory mapping; Procedural justice; Recognition justice; Social values","decision making; environmental justice; GIS; greenspace; local participation; mapping; spatial distribution; urban area; urban planning; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139726388

These trends are currently important topics in city management. As a significant driver of digitalization, technological development has been found to have great potential as a mitigator of a wide range of issues that cities face. To ensure the available technologies are being correctly used, municipalities need to measure their degree of digitalization. This assessment is also important to improve city officials’ understanding of areas that need interventions so that cities can be managed better and provide their residents with a better quality of life. This study applies the baseline principles of the multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach to develop a decision-support system that facilitates urban digitalization evaluations. The results rely on insights provided by a panel of experts in this area, who used cognitive mapping and the best worst method (BWM) to identify important evaluation criteria within urban digitalization and to analyze their cause-and-effect relationships. The final outcomes were validated by the panel members and representatives of the Associação Nacional de Municípios Portugueses (i.e., National Association of Portuguese Municipalities) and the Agência National de Inovação (i.e., National Innovation Agency).

We measure the meritocratic share of well-being, defined as the share of explained variation in life satisfaction attributable to variation in merits not related to SEB. The empirical evidence from Denmark combines survey information on well-being with administrative data on individual characteristics. We find systematic differences in well-being already in early adulthood, where differences in economic outcomes are not yet visible. At age 18–19, about 40 percent of the inequality in well-being is meritocratic. The role of merits rises to 65–85 percent in midlife (age 40–55), where it is also higher than the role of merits in income inequality. The positive conclusions that inequality in well-being is more meritocratic than income inequality and more meritocratic as people grow older get support by corresponding results using an equal opportunity approach. © 2022 The Author(s)","Inequality; Intergenerational mobility; Subjective well-being",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138835944

The qualitative assessment consists of a literature review of existing studies about EV charging behaviour and an analysis of semi-structured interviews with Danish EV users. This assessment identifies the most relevant factors for charging. In addition, it highlights that the time horizon of the charging decision is an essential factor. We use this to design two stated-choice (SC) experiments explicitly taking these findings into account. The first SC experiment looks into long-term decisions related to regular charging practices. The second SC experiment captures decisions related to occasional charging needs on longer trips. The SC data consist of three responses from 558 EV owners for each of the two experiments. We model the data using mixed logit models to allow for unobserved heterogeneity and the repeated nature of the SC data. The main findings indicate a high preference for all-inclusive/flat fee pricing structures. Moreover, they show that respondents value interoperability between charging networks, both nationally and internationally. Related to occasional charging, we find willingness-to-pay measures describing the detour respondents are willing to drive to obtain lower costs, a higher likelihood of available chargers, and facilities at the charging location.

Correspondingly, the designed transit service characteristics, including the spacing of lines and stations, line headways and lengths, may vary over space and time to better cater for variable passenger demands. A successive substitution solution approach and an endpoint method are employed to generate an optimal solution. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the properties of the model and validate the solution methods. The results indicate that a trunk-feeder bimodal transit network is preferable under a higher-level heterogeneous demand. A rail-bus system is much more desirable compared to a bus rapid transit (BRT)-bus bimodal system in a larger and more developed city. Another interesting finding is that the scale of at-stop emission cost reduction is significantly larger than that of inter-stop emission. Compared to the conventional bimodal transit network design models without accounting for vehicle emissions, the incorporation of an emission factor into the optimization model can reduce both the total system and emission costs, which consequently achieves a more sustainable bimodal transit system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bimodal transit; Continuum approximation; Feeder bus; Public transit; Vehicle emission","Bus transportation; Buses; Optimization; Rapid transit; Bimodal transit; Continuum approximation; Feeder bus; Heterogeneous environments; Optimization models; Passenger demands; Public transit; Space and time; Transit networks; Vehicle emission; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138788983

However, developing a blockchain-based platform ecosystem creates various challenges for the platform sponsor that may influence industry-wide adoption and, ultimately, the platform's success. This study follows the development of TradeLens, a leading global shipping platform ecosystem underpinned by blockchain technology. We examine the factors affecting industry-wide adoption among global supply chain actors by unpacking platform value drivers and platform governance mechanisms identified at TradeLens. While the platform value hinges on the digitalization of workflows and the ecosystem leverage, the platform governance includes strategic (off-chain), technology (on-chain), and interoperability (on- and off-chain) governance – as mechanisms for effectively managing a blockchain-based platform ecosystem.

Although accurate estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock production systems is complex, there are several available tools to assist with the emissions estimation. These tools differ in many ways, such as in terms of accessibility, methodology, assumptions, and scope. Such tools are important because they help farmers know where their farms and livestock production processes stand in terms of sustainability. This information also helps farmers in devising and implementing mitigation strategies. In this paper, we review and assess popular and available open-access decision-support tools (DSTs) for estimating farm-level GHG emissions from livestock production systems. We noted that most of the available tools are built based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 2 guidelines, and relevant region- and product-specific assumptions. Only a very few tools, such as GLEAM and CFT, are suitable for all geographic locations. Apart from GHG emissions estimation, some tools, such as AgRECalc, provide static general recommendations to support decision-making in GHG emissions mitigation, and other tools, such as Holos, include scenario analysis. We also observed that most of the tools are lacking concrete recommendation provisions to assist in developing mitigation strategies. Such recommendation engines can be of great help to farmers in identifying potential focus areas to prioritize while developing mitigation strategies. We, furthermore, present a high-level framework of a decision support system that addresses the discovered gaps and can be adopted for sustainable livestock farming. © 2022","Assessment framework; Decision-support systems; GHG assessment tools; Livestock farming","Agriculture; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Sustainable development; Assessment framework; Assessment tool; Decision supports; Greenhouse gas assessment tool; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Livestock farming; Livestock production; Mitigation strategy; Support tool; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137616370

Subsequently, Science-Based Targets (SBTs) have been set for companies as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets consistent with the required decarbonisation level to limit the temperature rise to less than 2 °C above the pre-industrial level. On the other hand, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been applied as a suitable decision-making tool to integrate the environmental impacts of products in strategic and long-term planning. Many Future-oriented LCA approaches with relatively short-term perspectives have been published. However, the operationalisation of SBTs requires quantification of companies' Environmental Impacts in the far future. There are a few studies on the future-oriented Environmental Impact Assessment of companies with SBTs consideration. This paper aims to develop a framework for future-oriented Environmental Impact assessment of companies towards operationalisation of SBTs. The proposed framework employs scenario analysis and SBTs for Future-oriented Environmental Impact Assessment of product families and companies. Accordingly, it quantifies companies’ Environmental Impact Reduction Requirement (EIRR) to provide Environmental impact Targets (ETs) for product families and proposes pathways for product families to reach SBTs. In this research, Apple Inc. is considered as the case study and the application of the proposed methodology. It is concluded that the 86.51% Environmental Impact Reduction Requirement (EIRR) of Apple Inc. will not be satisfied considering different scenarios. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Absolute sustainability; Future-oriented life cycle assessment; Planetary boundaries; Science-based targets","Decision making; Earth (planet); Emission control; Environmental impact assessments; Fruits; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Absolute sustainability; Decarbonisation; Emission reduction targets; Future-oriented life cycle assessment; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Human activities; Impact reduction; Planetary boundary; Product families; Science-based target; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137162340

While contracts, rules, policies, and industrial standards have been identified as important for coordinating and aligning inter-firm relationships, tools for the collective, collaborative orchestration of ecosystems have yet to be fully identified and articulated by scholars. The core contribution of this paper, the authors contend, is that corporate foresight tools, as applied at the level of the ecosystem, have the potential to orchestrate ecosystems. To this end, the authors examine the practical use of corporate foresight tools, in this case, roadmapping and scenario planning, as employed by ECOPRODIGI, an Interreg Baltic Sea project designed to advance the EU's strategy for eco-efficient Sustainable Blue Economy in the Roll-on/Roll-off (Ro-Ro) shipping ecosystem. Results demonstrate how ecosystem-level foresight significantly differs from traditional foresight centered around a focal firm. Corporate foresight tools, as applied to an ecosystem: 1) Target a diverse set of ecosystem actors beyond the segment's focal firm, including complementary firms, investors, and non-market actors; 2) Engage ecosystem actors, rather than only the focal firm, in shared strategy development based on a diverse mix of foresight tools; and 3) serve to orient and reify the ecosystem by charting the collective anticipation of innovations, policies, etc., in a shared set of future options. In the end, the authors find that corporate foresight tools operate as constitutive elements of ecosystems, that is, the tools help enact the ecosystem not as an abstract concept but as a shared, lived reality. © 2022 The Authors","Business ecosystems; Corporate foresight; Focal firm; Maritime; Orchestration; Roadmapping; Scenario planning; Shipping","Economics; Investments; Ships; Baltic sea; Business ecosystem; Corporate foresight; Corporates; Focal firm; Maritime; Orchestration; Roadmapping; Scenario Planning; Sources of innovation; Ecosystems; business development; corporate social responsibility; European Union; maritime trade; maritime transportation; shipping; stakeholder; strategic approach; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137123857

However, existing research reveals no golden standard for identifying suitable part candidates for AM and mainly combines preexisting methods that lack conceptual underpinnings. As a result, the identification approaches are not adjusted to organizations and are not completely operationalizable. Our first contribution is to investigate and map the existing literature from the perspective of knowledge management (KM). The second contribution is to develop and empirically investigate a combined part-identification approach in a defense sector case study. The part identification entailed an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), semi-structured interviews, and workshops. In the first run, we screened 35,000 existing aftermarket and legacy parts. Similar to previous research, the approach was not in sync with the organization. However, in contrast to previous research, we infuse part identification with KM theory by developing and testing a “Phase 0” assessment that ensures an operational fit between the approach and the organization. We tested Phase 0 and the knowledge management-based approach in a second run, which is the main contribution of this study. This paper contributes empirical research that moves beyond previous research by demonstrating how to overcome the present challenges of part identification and outlines how knowledge management-based part identification integrates with current operations and supply chains.

The common understanding is that NIS are the primary source of technological knowledge acquisition for innovating firms, but the opening of economies, the globalization of innovation networks, and the rapid internationalization of innovative firms challenge this view – especially with respect to small open economies in transition. We applied PLS-SEM to data from 131 R&D intensive firms responding to a survey investigating the mediating role of international networks for technological learning within Lithuania's NIS. The findings demonstrate a full mediating role of global innovation system networks in facilitating technological learning within NIS, partially contradicting the prevailing understanding of the primary importance of NIS based networks for firm learning. Technological learning of firms, and thus the upgrading of the NIS they are embedded in, relies more on international networks than previously assumed. These results call for a more careful design and facilitation of technological learning networks, recognizing global networks as a complementary and necessary component in NIS upgrading.

Moreover, the levels of integration between partners and the levels of digitalisation in Closed Loop Supply Chains (CLSCs) are still low, yet the benefits for society are vitally relevant. Enabling technologies under the Industry 4.0 umbrella have demonstrated their positive impacts mainly on the manufacturing level, while a few researchers have investigated their effects at the SC level. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to concentrate its attention on the analysis of the benefits that enabling Industry 4.0 technologies can provide in terms of mitigating the risks in CLSCs, with a specific focus on the operational risks. Through two systematic literature reviews, this paper identifies the main operational risks connected with CLSCs activities and describes the impact of Industry 4.0 technologies on mitigating identified risks. A conceptual framework and a new cross-sectional matrix are proposed to summarise the reviews and to support future managerial initiatives in the CLSCs domain.

This study posits that this is not a reasonable approach to achieving such a balance. I used a micro-economic model where the explorative and exploitative activities are modeled in accordance with the definitions in March (1991). This model shows that the personal cost to the employee of performing activities was a crucial factor in determining their balancing of resources between exploration and exploitation. However, these personal costs are also the Achilles' heel of such balance calculations because information regarding this type of cost is incomplete and difficult, perhaps even impossible, for the owner or manager to obtain. Based on this and the process and output characteristics of exploratory activities, I argue that it is not appropriate to design a hard, quantitative performance measurement and incentive system to balance resource allocation between explorative and exploitative activities.

However, critics have argued that urban adaptation efforts largely focus on preserving economic growth while overlooking the root causes of unequal vulnerability to climate impacts, giving rise to climate injustices. In response, literature on transformational adaptation has politicized these issues but it has remained largely conceptual, particularly in relation to the question of which actors can define and advance transformative approaches. Furthermore, existing empirical studies focus on positive cases while ignoring why these issues more commonly are not politicized. In this article, we add empirical rigour to these debates through an investigation into Malmö's climate politics. We analyse what enables or inhibits the role of three political outsiders – disadvantaged communities, climate movements and social justice activists – in politicizing urban climate adaptation. We find that, while the most vulnerable social groups struggle with climatic impacts and experience difficulties in politicizing these issues, climate movements remain focused on climate mitigation and largely ignore local adaptation. In turn, we highlight the untapped capacity of social justice activism to act as social infrastructure for adaptation. Our findings suggest that alliances between the victims of adaptation injustices and local activist groups could support the politicization of those grievances by responding to emerging needs and by building policy-oriented pressure for transformational adaptation. However, we identify several factors that limit this potential, thereby contributing to an understanding of why social movements sometimes do not live up to their transformational potential. © 2022 The Authors","Activism; Adaptation; Climate change; Malmö; Vulnerability","adaptation; climate change; climate effect; economic growth; environmental policy; mitigation; politics; social movement; urban climate; vulnerability; Malmo; Skane; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133919552

Feminist Cultural Studies' scholarship has remarked and critiqued the centrality of work in contemporary cultural discourses of female emancipation and empowerment, highlighting how the celebration of female workplace success has been employed to sustain the social, cultural, and economic project of neoliberalism. However, this academic field has focused predominantly on young women and women up to childbearing age, failing to account for the way older femininity is being increasingly included in neoliberal discourses through the encouragement to work in old age. Through the dialogic relationship between ‘entrepreneurialism’ and―what I call―‘gendered anti-welfarism’ in old age, the UK social policy draws on a feminist vocabulary to offer ‘the older entrepreneurial woman’ as its ideal subject, characterized by capacity and willingness to work, personal and job-market flexibility, responsibilization and individualization of risk, and―but only for the more privileged few―choice. Ultimately, the article illustrates how contemporary cultural discourses that place work as central to female empowerment and emancipation are not limited to younger women, but extend to older femininity through the normalization of the figure of the older entrepreneurial woman, with the articulation of a ‘neoliberal feminism in old age’. © 2022 The Authors.

The empirical case showcases how muxes organize and defend their gender identity vis-à-vis processes of colonization and hybridity. The findings reveal unique forms of indigenous knowledges, gender activism, and gender organizing and are categorized into six themes: language and subjectification; work, social structure, and sexuality; religion and myth; esthetics and beauty; work discrimination and gender-based violence; and emancipation and queer activism. The analysis explains the possibility of becoming of different gender/ethnic identities and multiple hybrid representations of agency and repression. We critically examine novel insights on how indigenous gender organizing is paradoxically appreciated and revered while also inciting discrimination and violence.

Particularly, we not only identify credibility, predatory, and compliance risk as three distinct types of opportunistic risk stemming from the unique socio-economic environment of China, but we also illustrate how blockchain could be leveraged to deal with such opportunistic risks through trust-evoking mechanisms.

To understand this overarching transformation, this paper extends the previous literature which has focused mostly on the organizational level by developing a multi-level research agenda for digital transformation (DT). In this regard, we propose an extended definition of DT as “a socioeconomic change across individuals, organizations, ecosystems, and societies that are shaped by the adoption and utilization of digital technologies.” We suggest four lenses to interpret the DT phenomenon: individuals (utilizing and adopting digital technologies), organizations (strategizing and coordinating both internal and external transformation), ecosystems (harnessing digital technologies in governance and co-producing value propositions), and geopolitical frameworks (regulating the environments in which individuals and organizations are embedded). Based on these lenses, we build a multi-level research agenda at the intersection between the bright and dark sides of DT and introduce the PIAI framework, which captures a process of perception, interpretation, and action that ultimately leads to possible impact. The PIAI framework identifies a critical research agenda consisting of a non-exhaustive list of topics that can assist researchers to deepen their understanding of the DT phenomenon and provide guidance to managers and policymakers when making strategic decisions that seek to shape and guide the DT. © 2022 The Authors.

Using a multi-method approach combining experimental and field data from online reviews, it was found that intentional (vs. unintentional) failures lead to greater negative word of mouth (nWOM) and patronage reduction. This research extends these findings by demonstrating that intentional failures are less harmful when the failure is reversible (vs. irreversible) and occurs at an employee (vs. firm) level. Further, while either psychological (e.g., apology) or monetary compensation is effective in mitigating the consequences of intentional failures at an employee level, a combined service recovery (psychological and monetary) is the best solution when the failure is at a firm level. Drawing on attribution theory, the article unveils the key role of trust (as opposed to justice) as the mechanism to explain the effects of intentionality on customers’ nWOM and patronage reduction. © The Author(s) 2021.","attribution theory; experiment; intentionality; service failure and recovery; text mining","cost analysis; data mining; experimental study; service quality; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117161018

We identify three such rhetorical strategies: (1) Silencing: Racialized subjects are organized by majority voices that speak of/for ‘the Other’; the training explicitly seeks to change the organization of public debate by working this hyphen. (2) Positioning: The main strategy for working the hyphen, as taught in the course, is to speak from a minority position, but in a manner that is recognizable to the majority. Thus, non-white participants are trained to speak with white voice; they become exceptions to the rule, tokens or role models when telling their stories in a scripted manner. And (3) Representing: In telling their own stories, the aspiring opinion leaders come to speak for racialized subjects as a group. Thus, the course (unwittingly) reproduces the current racialized organization of public space in the form of ‘benign discrimination’.

However, given the high annotation costs and the time required by quality inspections, data is often available in an unlabeled form. This is fostering the use of active learning for the development of soft sensors and predictive models. In production, instead of performing random inspections to obtain product information, labels are collected by evaluating the information content of the unlabeled data. Several query strategy frameworks for regression have been proposed in the literature but most of the focus has been dedicated to the static pool-based scenario. In this work, we propose a new strategy for the stream-based scenario, where instances are sequentially offered to the learner, which must instantaneously decide whether to perform the quality check to obtain the label or discard the instance. The approach is inspired by the optimal experimental design theory and the iterative aspect of the decision-making process is tackled by setting a threshold on the informativeness of the unlabeled data points. The proposed approach is evaluated using numerical simulations and the Tennessee Eastman Process simulator. The results confirm that selecting the examples suggested by the proposed algorithm allows for a faster reduction in the prediction error. © 2022 The Author(s)","Active learning; Linear regression; Optimal experimental design; Soft sensor; Unlabeled data","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision theory; Learning systems; Statistics; Active Learning; Automated data collection; Data collection scheme; Linear modeling; Optimal experimental designs; Real- time; Sensorics; Soft sensors; Stream-based; Unlabeled data; Iterative methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138441801

In this respect, the interface between I4.0 and CE research is a relatively young field of inquiry that has been little concerned with developments in GVCs. We systematically review 112 peer-reviewed papers in the field of I4.0 and CE to distill key future research opportunities and trends in the GVC field. We develop three specific conclusions from our literature review. First, GVCs can vary widely within the various forms of I4.0 technologies with the various CE practices. Second, GVC research is underdeveloped with regard to I4.0 and CE. Third, our findings are congruent with previously published studies, which recognize the importance of GVC research that has generated a rich body of knowledge, mainly from a governance perspective in operations management, supply chain management, and international business. Likewise, our study offers promising avenues for future research studies at the intersection of I4.0, CE, and GVCs.

Responsible research and innovation (RRI) is necessary to achieve goals such as eliminating poverty, eradicating hunger, and reducing inequality, as well as for reducing the environmental impact. This study analyzes the extent to which these goals are being implemented by large, innovative firms featured in Fortune's Change the World list. A content analysis of the corporate reports made available by 40 firms was conducted to act as the basis of an analysis of the sustainable measures currently being undertaken. We have conceptualized firm engagement as a constraint map for RRI where frugal and other constraint-based innovation may be suitable for firms acting in areas with low engagement. Conversely, when many firms address the same goal, large firms may better leverage their efforts if acting in innovation ecosystems. The findings indicate that companies are prioritizing the reduction of greenhouse gases, implementation of data security, promotion of diversity at the workplace, and the health and safety of employees. Overall, there is a tendency towards corporate measures that not only contribute towards the SDGs but also create clear financial value and target regulatory compliance. Sustainability reporting must thus be developed to avoid the SDGs becoming a tool for green washing and similar behaviors. © 2022","Content analysis; Innovation; Responsible research and innovation; SDGs; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals","Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Regulatory compliance; % reductions; Constraint-based; Content analysis; Corporates; Innovation; Innovative firms; Responsible research and innovation; Sustainable development goal; United Nations; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136456399

These companies are also expressing growing concerns about sustainability and its strategic integration into operations. However, SMEs have been prevented from making investments in sustainability by the absence of a holistic view of this topic, an overemphasis on an economic perspective, and the consequent devaluation of environmental and social perspectives. In this context, greater importance needs to be given to investigating SME sustainability and building a transparent, holistic, and realistic business model. The present study combines cognitive mapping and the best worst method (BWM) to identify determinants of sustainable entrepreneurship in SMEs. These techniques were applied in two meetings with a panel of specialists with knowledge about and experience in this subject matter. The insights obtained during the two panel meetings allowed the proposed process-oriented approach to assist decision-makers in analyzing a sample of SMEs and selecting the ones that best match the following clusters of decision criteria: (1) entrepreneur profile; (2) firm internal characteristics; (3) economic factors; (4) other external factors; and (5) market.

This study employed a Berkeley-Trent (BETR) model to simulate benzo[α]pyrene (BaP) exposure levels in aquatic ecosystems of coastal regions during 1985–2050 while considering five shared socio-economic scenarios (SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, and SSP5). The highest BaP concentrations were estimated for Shanghai and Tianjin, corresponding to the two areas that exhibited the highest potential human health risk. Risk quotient (RQ) analysis indicated that aquatic ecosystems in 80% of coastal areas were potentially affected by BaP contamination, while higher RQ values were observed for Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangdong. Crustaceans in aquatic ecosystems were estimated to be more sensitive to BaP exposure compared to amphibians, fish, and mollusks, with the former exhibiting potentially affected fraction (PAF) values of 0.19%–20.26%. Further, PAFs of crustacean for Shanghai and Tianjin were 9.73% and 6.57%, respectively, both exceeding 5% and suggesting that crustaceans within these two areas would likely considerably suffer from greater BaP exposure threats. BaP exposure levels and corresponding risks continuously increased from 1985 to 2035 with ongoing intensive land-based activities, followed by slight decreases during 2035–2050. The SSP1 scenario represented a sustainable development strategy that led to lower emissions compared to the SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, and SSP5 scenarios. Employing strategies like those in the SSP1 scenario will thus help reduce BaP exposure levels and risks to environments and humans. Thus, SSP1 is the optimal scenario to help control future contamination and potential ecological risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health in coastal areas. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic ecosystem; BaP exposure; Human health; Land-based activities; Risk assessment","Aquatic ecosystems; Barium compounds; Coastal zones; Economics; Health; Health risks; Planning; Risk perception; BaP exposure; Benzo[α]pyrene; Coastal area; Ecosystem health; Exposure level; Human health; Land-based activity; Risk quotients; Risks assessments; Tianjin; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136246476

The suggested hybrid model enables the integrated energy distribution system (IEDS) operator to apply several risk-averse methods concurrently, based on the nature of the uncertainties and the availability of data for unknown parameters. The conditional value-at-risk-based stochastic programming (CVaR-SP) technique is utilized to cover the uncertainty in wind speed, vehicle behavior in a parking lot, day-ahead energy prices, and multi-energy demands. Furthermore, the infromation gap decision theory (IGDT) model is used to control uncertainty in real-time energy prices without requiring the use of a probability distribution function or the creation of scenarios. To provide a high-flexibility structure to meet a variety of demands, the IEDS is outfitted with some local energy resources, including a gas-fired power-only unit, a gas-fired combined heat and power plant, a wind turbine, a gas boiler, an electric vehicle parking lot (EVPL), multi-energy storages (MESs), and integrated demand response (IDR).

The public trust agenda is an antidote to rampant bureaucratic control and, in particular, the marketization and instrumentalization associated with New Public Management. The book approaches trust from a relational perspective that draws on insights from trust research, modern sociology and organization and management theory, while lending support to developments in New Public Governance. It provides a theoretical framework that distinguishes between institutional, economic, moral and relational trust and shows how a relational perspective is able to incorporate insights from the other paradigms in an inclusive approach to trust processes. Apart from providing a theoretical reading of the workings of trust in public organizations, the book addresses how trust relates to power and control along with notions of debureaucratization, post-bureaucratic organization and post-heroic leadership. It also shows how the trust agenda, in theory and practice, is related to social capital and thus efforts to strengthen social relations and collaboration in and around public organizations. Speaking of practice, the book takes its empirical point of departure in the Danish public sector. However, the aim of the book is not to promote the ""High trust"" Danish case as a benchmark or best practice. The aim is to theorize and help make sense of this particular experience by applying general theory to it and extracting general insights - with broader application - from its particular manifestations and outcomes. There is a need for more elaborate theorizing about trust and power in a public sector setting, and the Danish experience is useful as a starting point for this ambition. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.

However, hierarchical governance in the form of vertical integration is still preferred in many industries for organizing innovation, and the current literature touches little on the relative performance of different organizational structures (integrated firms vs innovation ecosystem) and the factors that lead firms to choose one over the other. The authors conjecture that structure of technological interdependence is one of such important factors. Using a computational experiment, the authors compare the innovation performance of ecosystems with integrated firms under different interdependency structures. Design/methodology/approach: Using the NKC model, the authors incorporate non-generic complementarities and modularity into the technological interdependence between different components. The authors compare four different types of technological interdependence (modular, hierarchical, nearly modular, and random). Findings: The results show that integrated firms with centralized search demonstrate stable and consistent performance that is robust to the structure of technological interdependencies, but an ecosystem significantly outperforms integrated firms with centralized or decentralized when the products exhibit modular or nearly-modular structures. Originality/value: This study sheds light on why an ecosystem often exhibits modular structures while vertical integration is prevalent in industries with complex technological interdependence. In addition, it shows the evolutionary nature of ecosystems and indicates how the cooperation and competition between actors shape the interdependence structure of ecosystems. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ecosystem; Innovation; Interdependencies; NK model; Value appropriation; Value creation","Structure (composition); Centralised; Innovation; Interdependency; Modular structures; Modulars; NK-models; Performance; Value appropriation; Value creation; Vertical integration; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135626284

In this paper, a large-scale method is developed to determine the minimum fleet size under future demand uncertainty, which is applied in a case study with millions of bike sharing trips in Nanjing. The findings show that if future uncertainty is not considered, more than 12% of trip demands may not be satisfied. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm for minimizing fleet size based on historical trip data is effective in handling future uncertainty. For a bike sharing system, supplying 14.5% of the original fleet could be sufficient to meet 96.8% of trip demands. Meanwhile, the results suggest a unified platform that integrates multiple companies can significantly reduce the total fleet size by 44.6%. Moreover, in view of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, this paper proposes a contact delay policy that maintains a suitable usage interval, which results in increased bike amount requirements.

We previously reported improved perceived knee function and functional performance (forward lunge ground contact time) in patients with an ACL injury from pre to 10 months post ACL reconstruction without improvement in knee-specific biomechanics. To further investigate this discrepancy, we additionally analyzed knee extensor and flexor muscle strength, and movement quality in the forward lunge (subjective and objective evaluations) and performed a full lower limb biomechanical analysis of the forward lunge movement. We included 12 patients with an ACL injury (tested before and after ACL reconstructive surgery) and 15 healthy controls from the previous study to the current investigation. Outcome measures were obtained pre and ~11 months post ACL reconstruction for the patients and at a single time point for the controls. Objective movement quality in the patients with an ACL injury showed an improvement from their pre reconstruction surgery visit to the post reconstruction visit but this was not observable in the subjective evaluation. Knee extensor muscle strength declined after the ACL reconstruction by 29% (p = 0.002) and both knee extensors (p < 0.001) and flexors (p = 0.027) were weaker in the patients post ACL reconstruction compared to healthy controls. ACL injured patients had an altered movement strategy in the forward lunge with reduced knee extensors contribution and increased hip extensor contribution compared to the controls both before and after the reconstruction. The altered movement strategy was associated with knee extensor muscle strength. This explorative study with a limited sample size found that clinicians should be aware that significant functional deficits in the knee extensor muscles, both in isolated muscle strength testing and during a functional movement, may be present although patients perceive an improvement in their knee function and present good functional performance without obvious movement quality issues.

These are seen as separate dimensions by which criteria can be formulated for a just state of affairs. And a just state of affairs regarding energy should fulfill all criteria. However, we show, using empirical research on six European energy communities that the tenets of energy justice are interdependent and negotiated in practice. We show this interdependency using three core concerns of justice—risk, effort and power—which we identified through our empirical work. Our findings reveal that community members are often willing to take risks and put in effort, if they are compensated with more power within the community. Similarly, members are willing to compromise power if no effort or risk-taking is required from them. This demonstrates the interdependency of the tenets “procedural justice” and “distributional justice” within energy communities. We reflect on the need for energy justice theory and policymakers to recognize the significance of this interdependency. © 2022, The Author(s).","Energy cooperatives; Energy justice; Justice issues; Renewable energy","social justice; Social Justice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138043434

This study explores whether charities can make people keep their promises by making such promises more explicit and more formal. In a door-to-door fund-raising field experiment, we vary the strength of the promise that donors make. Besides a control group where people can promise to donate, we apply two treatment groups. In the first treatment, donors are asked to verbally pledge a precise amount. In a second treatment, this amount is in addition put on paper with the solicitor's signature added. Both treatments are aimed at making it morally more expensive not to keep promises. Our results show that: (1) the majority of people do not follow through on their promise to donate; (2) donors who pledge an explicit amount more often keep their promise. The more formal the commitment, the closer the amount donated is to the amount promised; (3) many participants refuse to pledge a donation amount when asked, and those who refuse donate significantly less. © 2022","Altruism; Charitable fundraising; Field experiment; Image motivation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137297734

An issue is that understandings are often based on unknown and unsuspected presuppositions inculcated in academic communities. This paper presents a meta position of changing viewing points and understandings from which to approach B2B research. The shade vine metaphor is introduced to open a set of different understandings concerning research viewing points as being braided with an entity and temporal process path of development. The ideas are developed by re-appraising the Cartesian epigram and approach, and by presenting an exemplar ‘business interaction’, as understood within the business and industrial network approach. The exposition of possible researcher understandings and presuppositions against the background of research development paths provides a capability to B2B researchers that enhances opportunities for future research, and does so within a frame that encompasses constructivist studies of processes and dynamics. Guidance is provided for research that adopts a temporal rather than a mechanistic process approach. The research viewing points presented, by fore fronting temporality, are likely to aid investigation of sustainability and biodiversity for future generations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Cartesian; Constructivist; Interaction; Performativity; Temporal process research; ‘We’",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136136103

Single cell protein (SCP) derived from microorganisms such as brewer's yeast is one of the best possible options to meet the protein challenges. Utilization of carbon and nitrogen recovered from waste streams, instead of sugar-rich substrate, for yeast-driving SCP production could improve the overall sustainability from both economic and environmental points of view. The lack of a comprehensive understanding of the process such as the interactions between different organic acids/ions and SCP production by yeast (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has placed a major impediment to the valorization effort. This study tackles this challenge by exploring the impact of various organic acids, nitrogen and ionic species on SCP production by S. cerevisiae. It was found that the SCP production increased with acetate concentrations (2.6–20 g-COD/L). A maximal protein concentration of 0.75 g/L was harvested using 20 g-COD/L acetate. Intermittent acid addition for pH neutralization further enhanced SCP production by 67% at 0.94 g/L. Ammonia was the best inorganic nitrogen source for S. cerevisiae among nitrate and nitrite. S. cerevisiae was not able to utilize lactate, propionate and butyrate alone for growth, but it can catabolize lactate along with acetate. The addition of oleate and linoleate resulted in a significant increase in the protein content of biomass by 1.8- and 1.6-fold, respectively. S. cerevisiae using acetate required eight times fewer K+ than Na+. Typical anions including Cl−, NO3− and SO42− (20–500 mM) were not found harmful for SCP synthesis. The results help to fill the knowledge gap in yeast-driving waste-to-protein conversion process, bring high impacts and positive implications for waste valorization and future feed and food supply. © 2022 The Author(s)","Acetate; Ammonia; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Single cell protein; Wastewater recovery","Fermentation; Food supply; Nitrogen; Proteins; Recovery; Substrates; Sustainable development; Volatile fatty acids; Yeast; Acetate; Brewer's yeasts; Carbon and nitrogen; Food proteins; Global population; Protein production; S.cerevisiae; Single cell proteins; Waste stream; Wastewater recovery; Ammonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135840644

In this study, hydrothermal treatment (HT)/alkaline HT combined with pyrolysis was used to treat SS for heavy metal immobilization. The heavy metal characteristics, including total, fraction, and leaching concentrations and potential ecological risks, were comprehensively investigated to ensure the safe application of biochar. The results showed that the heavy metals mainly remained in the hydrochar and biochar. Additionally, both HT and alkaline HT promoted the residual fractions of Cr, Zn, Ni, and Cu in biochar. Furthermore, alkaline HT-aided pyrolysis was more effective for immobilizing Zn and Ni with their residual fractions increasing by 100% and 60% respectively, compared with direct sludge pyrolysis. Moreover, the ecological risk of heavy metals in SS significantly decreased from 57.27 to 30.05 after alkaline HT-combined pyrolysis treatment, contributing to the low potential ecological risk of SS-based biochar. This study provides a promising strategy for converting SS to biochar with improved heavy metal immobilization. © 2022","Alkali addition; Ecological risk; Heavy metals; Hydrothermal treatment; Pyrolysis; Sewage sludge","Biology; Chromium compounds; Copper compounds; Lead compounds; Nickel compounds; Pyrolysis; Sewage sludge; Zinc compounds; Alkali addition; Alkalines; Biochar; Ecological risks; Environmental pollutions; Heavy metal immobilization; Hydrothermal treatments; Living organisms; Potential ecological risk; Residual fraction; Heavy metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135720043

This particular type of network is gaining increasing attention. However, despite evidence of the importance of brokerage dynamics for knowledge mobility anchored in science and technology research, three main questions remain open: Who acts as network broker in TTNs? What are their specific functions? What mechanisms do they adopt to support these functions? To answer these questions, we conducted an in-depth multi-case study focusing on three European centers of excellence in scientific research, namely the University of Cambridge (UK), the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland), and the Italian Institute of Technology (Italy). We find that institutional actors as well as individuals act as network brokers in TTNs, and that brokerage manifests with varying degrees of formalization related to the TTN's level of maturity. We also identify six network brokerage functions, namely conflict resolution, spreading knowledge, linking idea fragments, connecting problems to solutions, expanding the network, and strengthening the network, and five mechanisms, namely endorsement, mediation, events, antennas, and digital support systems, that support these functions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Brokerage; Innovation ecotones; Knowledge mobility; Networks; Science-based entrepreneurship; Technology transfer","Dynamics; Brokerage; Business ecosystem; Case-studies; Hybrid network; Innovation ecotone; Knowledge mobility; Network; Network innovations; Science-based entrepreneurship; Transfer network; Technology transfer; ecotone; entrepreneur; innovation; knowledge based system; mobility; network analysis; technology transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135411293

This can be reduced either by (1) using a low-carbon energy source and/or (2) reducing the volumes of the non-hydrocarbon produced/injected fluids. This paper describes how improved oil recovery techniques can be designed to reduce CO2 intensity (kgCO2/bbl oil) of oil production by efficient use of the injectants. It is shown that CO2 emissions associated with injection of chemicals is strongly influenced by water cut at the start of the project, extent of the water cut reduction, and chemical utilization factor defined as the volume of produced oil per mass or volume of the injectant. As an example, for the oil field considered in this study, 3–8% reduction in water cut can result in 50–80% reduction in its CO2 intensity. In addition to the incremental oil production with lower CO2 intensity, the earlier implementation of enhanced oil recovery methods can extend the lifetime of the mature fields if carbon emission cut-offs are applied. In case of CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR), the large storage potential for CO2 can significantly reduce the overall CO2 emissions of oil, albeit at a large energetic cost. For CO2 EOR using CO2 captured from gas power plants, improving the utilization factor from 2 bbl/tCO2 to 4 bbl/tCO2 can reduce the CO2 intensity of the produced oil from 120 kgCO2/bbl to 80 kgCO2/bbl (33% reduction). © 2022 The Author(s)","Climate change; CO2 intensity; Enhanced oil recovery; Exergy analysis; Improved oil recovery","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Enhanced recovery; Gas plants; Indicators (chemical); % reductions; CO 2 emission; CO2 intensity; Enhanced-oil recoveries; Exergy Analysis; Improved oil recovery; Injectant; Oil-production; Recovery techniques; Water cuts; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135340996

With external control mechanisms becoming more sophisticated, full internalization has become increasingly unnecessary. Rather, the capacity to orchestrate complex networks is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage. We demonstrate that internalization theory does not need to assume that the MNE is all powerful, or that it can dictate the choice of mode with its foreign business partners. We also disagree with the argument that internalization theory presumes perfect rationality. When managers’ perceptions deviate from reality, they do indeed make wrong choices (over- and under-internalization) that come with various types of efficiency penalties. We share the Forsgren and Holm view that a learning perspective can provide insights on the evolution of an MNE’s asset recombination mode, as it gains experience and knowledge. Furthermore, we show that internalization theory has been extended to incorporate such a learning perspective. © 2022, Academy of International Business.","internalization theory; theories, capabilities and capability development; theories, resource-based view or resource-based theory; topics; topics, firm-specific advantages; topics, global supply chain strategies; topics, international business theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135206647

The existing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies on 3DCP lack clearly defined functional units of comparison, especially considering load-bearing structures. This paper investigates the potential environmental benefits of 3DCP over conventional concrete construction for structural beams based on a cradle-to-grave comparative LCA. Unlike existing studies, this paper employs a recarbonation model to account for the carbon offsetting from the use-stage of 3DP concrete, which shows significant results. The assessment includes three-beam designs, each analyzed for both prefabrication and on-site construction scenarios. While currently, 3DCP has a generally higher environmental impact due to the larger quantity of cement employed in the process, the reduction of material through infill optimization for printed beams is a promising design principle to positively offset the environmental impacts in the construction sector. The paper draws recommendations for future research on material- and recarbonation-efficient 3DCP design for load-bearing structures, as well as on material development, e.g. integration of larger aggregates and low-clinker cement.

The structural barriers mainly relate to the lack of an ecosystem framework to manage intellectual property in complex interactions. The societal barriers concern the clock speed conflict between parts of the quintuple helix entrepreneurial ecosystem, and the ethical barriers arise from the widespread impact of enabling technologies in combination with the diffusion of ethical responsibility throughout the ecosystem.

Second, an AI-human collaboration of AI supporting a human employee increases consumer acceptance of AI service for tasks that require high warmth. This is not the case for AI-human collaboration in which AI performs a task that is supervised by a human employee. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of how consumer acceptance of AI service varies across tasks and how AI-human collaboration can advance AI acceptance. These findings provide insightful suggestions for managers regarding designing AI service and framing AI-human collaboration. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","AI acceptance; AI service; AI-human collaboration; Required warmth","Personnel; 'current; Artificial intelligence acceptance; Artificial intelligence service; Artificial intelligence-human collaboration; Choice-based conjoint; Conjoint experiments; Consumer acceptance; Intelligence services; Required warmth; Technological advances; Artificial intelligence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131397005

This divorce of two closely related academic fields has removed political explanations to key developments in the public service from Public Administration research and thus it tends to provide a partial view of the reality that it seeks to capture. There are several developments underway in the public sector, which underscore the political nature of public administration. These developments include the rise of administration politics; a growing emphasis on strategic management; governance-driven democratization and administrative micro-politics; the increasing significance of interactive and collaborative forms of governance; the rise of multilevel governance; and the development toward a more active citizenship. We find that in all of these areas, public administration research would benefit from incorporating a political science understanding of power, democracy, governance and citizenship. © 2022 The Authors.

The method consists of eight steps to elicit consumers’ emotional connection with craft producers and trigger attention towards their social and environmental impact.

While the literature has extensively explored their impact on worker and establishment outcomes, the negotiation process between works council representatives and their employer has remained largely unexplored. This article contributes to filling this gap by investigating wage discrimination towards works councilors in Germany. Fixed effects models leveraging panel data show that councilors receive a wage premium that positively correlates with the sectoral coverage of collective bargaining. In the manufacturing sector, where the tradition of bargaining is heavily entrenched, employers positively discriminate councilors. In contrast, in the service sector, where the culture of bargaining is weak, employers penalize works councilors. In both sectors, partisan and unionized works councilors are the most affected. The most likely hypothesis to explain these results is that employers strategically discriminate these councilors in order to bypass the traditional constraints of establishment-level participation.

After the statistical language models, Quantum Language Model (QLM) has been proposed to unify both single words and compound terms in the same probability space without extending term space exponentially. Although QLM achieved good performance in ad hoc retrieval, it still has two major limitations: (1) QLM cannot make use of supervised information, mainly due to the iterative and non-differentiable estimation of the density matrix, which represents both queries and documents in QLM. (2) QLM assumes the exchangeability of words or word dependencies, neglecting the order or position information of words.This article aims to generalize QLM and make it applicable to more complicated matching tasks (e.g., Question Answering) beyond ad hoc retrieval. We propose a complex-valued neural network-based QLM solution called C-NNQLM to employ an end-to-end approach to build and train density matrices in a light-weight and differentiable manner, and it can therefore make use of external well-trained word vectors and supervised labels. Furthermore, C-NNQLM adopts complex-valued word vectors whose phase vectors can directly encode the order (or position) information of words. Note that complex numbers are also essential in the quantum theory. We show that the real-valued NNQLM (R-NNQLM) is a special case of C-NNQLM.The experimental results on the QA task show that both R-NNQLM and C-NNQLM achieve much better performance than the vanilla QLM, and C-NNQLM's performance is on par with state-of-the-art neural network models. We also evaluate the proposed C-NNQLM on text classification and document retrieval tasks. The results on most datasets show that the C-NNQLM can outperform R-NNQLM, which demonstrates the usefulness of the complex representation for words and sentences in C-NNQLM. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.","language model; neural network; Quantum theory; question answering","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Computational linguistics; Information retrieval systems; Matrix algebra; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Ad Hoc retrieval; Complex-valued neural networks; Density matrix; Language model; Network-based; Neural-networks; Performance; Position information; Question Answering; Word vectors; Quantum theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130242036

Drawing on Zerilli’s freedom-centred feminism, our study sets out to answer this question at the intersection of freedom, feminism and work. Critics argue that women’s business networks promote a postfeminist view of freedom focusing on individual self-realisation and thus participate in rolling back collective, feminist efforts to dismantle structural inequalities. We reconceptualise women’s business networks as political arenas and argue that making claims about shared interests and concerns in such an arena constitutes a feminist practice of freedom. With an original, inductive and qualitative research design combining topic modeling and dialectical analysis, we examine the claims made in 1529 posts across four women’s business network blogs. We identify postfeminist claims and new forms of change and transformation that can help to advance women’s freedom across three ‘dialectics of freedom’: conformity and imagination; performative care and relational care; sameness and openness. Our findings show that uncertain and contradictory ways of defining and engaging with women’s freedom can emerge through claim-making in such arenas. The fragility of the process and its outcomes are, then, what can move feminism forward at work and beyond. © The Author(s) 2022.","blogs; dialectics; feminism; freedom; postfeminism; topic modeling; women’s business networks","adult; article; blogging; dialectics; drawing; female; feminism; human; human experiment; imagination; major clinical study; qualitative research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127741631

It does so by exploring three empirical cases of alternative organizing, namely the sustainable fin-tech start-up SusPens, teachers of mindfulness meditation, and the UK minor party Independents for Frome. The article first identifies a common trajectory, according to which alternative organizing usually begins with a rejection of the dominant socio-economic order. However, in seeking to increase their impact on the world, alternatives are often appropriated by the very order they were meant to depart from. On that basis, we explore how freedom can be articulated and enacted as emergent tactics that break free from this common trajectory and constitute alternativity as the ‘other’ within the existing order; in the cracks and crevasses that evade (discursive) regulation and where liberties can be taken. More specifically, we identify three emergent tactics of endurance, germination, and reiteration and discuss what they may teach us about organizing for freedom in the 21st century. © The Author(s) 2022.","alternative organization; freedom; mindfulness; political parties; sustainable finance","article; endurance; finance; freedom; germination; human; mindfulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125518066

In this article, we show how a field-based course in an East African country can support such learning. Based on data gathered from students over several iterations of the field course, we draw on experiential learning theory (ELT) in showing how the top-down orchestration of the course constituted a learning space that produced three main types of disruption to students’ taken-for-granted habits and assumptions, namely: intense sensory impressions and sensations, loss of predictability and control, and learning interdependency on others. Students had to “bottom-up” manage these disruptions while conducting a group assignment with local students, to a tight deadline, producing “dissonances”—feelings of discomfort—that triggered the ELT cycle. Our findings show that such disruptions can foster learning of the abovementioned abilities; and we suggest ways in which such learning spaces might be created closer to home than East Africa. © The Author(s) 2022.","Africa; developing countries; experiential learning; field course; intercultural awareness/development; project-based learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123950364

This is necessary because a unified approach that considers the organizational sustainability frames of different organizations (FPOs, NPOs and hybrids) is absent in the extant research. Towards this end, we undertake an integrative review of 158 articles and identify seven frames based on three objective functions: maximization of economic capital, maintaining natural capital and creating social impact. Of the seven, three are dogmatic, each accepting only one objective function as legitimate: economic, natural and social capital; three are instrumental, with one objective function as the ultimate goal and the others as necessary means; and the last one is paradoxical, where tensions between objective functions are accommodated simultaneously rather than eliminated. We contribute to the literature by introducing the ‘dogmatic frame’ category to the ongoing conversation on organizational sustainability frames. We also contribute by demonstrating that instrumental frames exist not only at for-profit organizations but also at non-profits and hybrid organizations. Consequently, we link the conversation in these areas with that of organizational sustainability frames. Finally, we problematize the growing attention on the paradoxical frame by discussing its suitability in different contexts and situations. © 2022 The Authors.

Pricing strategies can utilize consumer response to gains and losses relative to internal reference prices, which are price expectations developed from past-observed prices. Consequently, many previous studies have been devoted to analyzing differences in internal reference price response across product categories and consumer characteristics. However, knowledge about internal reference price response across different store formats is missing. Our study aims to fill this research gap. To do so, we estimate a reference price model for the same set of brands and the same sample of consumers across two store formats (discount chain vs. supermarket chain). The prices for the brands in our model are similar across store formats. Results from our proposed model show that the same consumers are loss-averse at the discount chain while gain-seeking at the supermarket chain. Predicted by previous literature, we attribute the difference in internal reference price response to the different price image of the store formats. Overall, our research contributes to the reference price literature and provides important implications for pricing strategies at stores with different price image. © 2021 The Author(s)","Brand choice; Internal reference price; Store price image",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120640165

These new models are regarded as promising alternatives to the patent-centric linear model. However, their implementation requires revising the roles of the actors in the technology transfer process and their relationships. While collaborative models could indeed be an attractive option for universities, there is limited evidence on how these collaboration processes could be effectively introduced. We use a longitudinal embedded multiple case study to explore the contribution of knowledge interactions between scientists and students in the preliminary steps of the technology transfer process. We investigate the learning dynamics between the focal actor, i.e., the scientist, and the students in a university setting to decipher how the introduction of such collaborative processes can contribute to knowledge and technology transfer. Our results suggest that students enrolled in an educational program can contribute to the scientist’s interest and engagement in technology transfer. However, we find out that the extent of the students’ contribution depends on the shared consensus over the technology function and the openness of the scientist to reconsider the technology’s meaning. We contribute to the ongoing exploration of alternative models for technology transfer and the identification of additional roles that students can take in entrepreneurial university ecosystems. © 2021, The Author(s).","Scientist-student teams; Students; Technology transfer models; University","Engineering education; Learning systems; Technology transfer; Collaborative modeling; Knowledge and technology transfer; Learning process; Scientist-student team; Student teams; Technology transfer model; Transfer models; Transfer process; Two ways; University; Students",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114824518

We show that historical narratives were used rhetorically by the representatives of both industries. In both cases, these historical narratives were targeted at just one subset of the population. Our research contributes to debates about stigmatization in ideologically diverse societies, an important issue that have been overlooked by the existing literature on stigmatized industries, which tends to assume the existence of homogeneous audiences when researching the efforts of industry representatives to destigmatize their industries. © The Author(s) 2021.","attitudes; business & government; business & society; stigma",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107783301

Drawing on institutional theory, a quantitative survey was developed and conducted of a sample of 140 firms in the electronics, food, textiles, toys and personal care sectors in Brazil. We examine how institutional pressures and firm-level agency influence the emergence of different patterns of CSR. We distinguish two clusters of companies: active companies identify business outcomes and actors that effectively exert an influence on their CSR practices, while passive companies consider institutional pressures to be of minor importance. Our contribution relates first, to institutional theory concerning the role of different actors in influencing the implementation of social and environmental practices; second, to the importance of collective coordination or its absence in shaping the specific characteristics of CSR; and third, to the agency of firms in responding to institutional pressures as being dependent on their perceptions of business outcomes.

Recently, several academicians have explored different strategies under the context of manufacturing including sustainable manufacturing and circular manufacturing. However, manufacturers struggle to shift towards these recent extensions of sustainable/circular manufacturing practices, because most of them are still not able to fully implement green manufacturing (GM). GM acts as a basic platform for these extended manufacturing practices to promote green transition, and manufacturers face several challenges within its implementation. Over the years, several studies explored the challenges and other related factors to promote GM, but manufacturers remain unclear on how to mitigate these challenges. This study considers two metrics of GM, challenges, and critical success factors (CSF), through which a systematic literature review has been made. Based on the review, a CSF theory-based framework has been developed by which GM adoption challenges were mapped with their corresponding mitigating CSFs of GM. To improve understanding among manufacturers, both the challenges and CSFs have been categorized into different dimensions. This is the first study to map the success factors of GM with adoption challenges of GM; this work permits manufacturers to recognize the exact challenges of GM and to understand how they can be mitigated particularly through selected CSFs. In fact, manufacturers will not need to examine other CSFs. In addition to strengthening the academic research of GM, this study seeks to assist practitioners in their journey of green transition with an in-depth explanation of mitigating challenges through CSFs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Challenges; Critical success factor theory; Green manufacturing; Green transition; Systematic literature review","Planning; Challenge; Critical success factor theory; Green manufacturing; Green transitions; Manufacturing challenges; Manufacturing operations; Manufacturing practices; Success factors; Sustainable strategies; Systematic literature review; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135459211

However, the implementation of CE initiatives often leads to rebound effects (RE), which limits the sustainability potential of CE. Despite the vast literature on rebound effects across several disciplines, such as ecological economics and industrial ecology, there is still a limited understanding regarding the occurrence of rebound effects within a CE context. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of RE with a particular focus on: (i) definitions; (ii) triggers and drivers; (iii) types and mechanisms; and (iv) measurement approaches. On the basis of the results of the SLR, a conceptual framework of RE is proposed. Furthermore, several gaps for RE research within CE have been identified and lead to the proposition of a number of potential research avenues: (1) expand the research scope and level of analysis to a systemic view; (2) enhance the understanding of RE triggered not only by efficiency, but also effectiveness and sufficiency; (3) expand the time horizon considered for the analysis, so to account for possible delays in the system; (4) deepen the understanding of the relationships between RE and all sustainability dimensions; (5) strengthen the research on the meso level; (6) account for the importance of system structure and system behaviour in the occurrence of RE; (7) model the causal dynamic relationships between important variables to anticipate the potential occurrence of RE; (8) develop robust approaches to estimate the potential RE triggered by CE initiatives. By consolidating the state-of-the-art within RE research and identifying the research directions for exploring RE within CE, this paper establishes a solid foundation for future research in the field. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Rebound effect; Sustainability; System thinking","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Conceptual frameworks; Ecological economics; Economic ecology; I-V measurements; Industrial ecology; Rebound-effect; Sustainability-potential; System thinkings; Systematic literature review; Systems thinking",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135381653

To safeguard the environment and facilitate sustainable livestock production, lower-impact manure management technologies need to be identified, evaluated and implemented. Slurry acidification has been developed to address some of the environmental challenges faced by pig farmers, such as methane and ammonia emissions, that contribute to environmental impacts such as climate change, terrestrial acidification and air fine particulate matter formation. However, the efficiency of this technology has been found to depend on local environmental and regulatory conditions. The current study compared two slurry treatment options (no treatment versus slurry acidification in storage tanks) under the climatic, agronomic and legislative conditions found in Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Data for the LCA model was collected from various sources and emissions following field application and crop yields were simulated over a 100-year period using the Daisy agricultural model. To address the uncertainty in LCA modelling, parameter analyses and Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 iterations were conducted followed by pairwise statistical tests. The results indicated that slurry acidification reduces the impact in all countries in impact categories mostly related to direct emissions from agriculture, such as methane and ammonia. For impact categories related to the provision of materials and energy to the farm, acidification increased the impacts in some cases. Additional requirements for lime application to counteract potential soil acidification did not result in significant changes in the performance of slurry acidification. The sulphur in the applied acid as an alternative to mineral S fertiliser can in some cases reduce the environmental impact of slurry acidification, but should not be advertised as doing so per se. Introducing stricter P application limits would seem to be the preferred option compared with slurry acidification in the Netherlands, while the opposite appeared true for Denmark. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; LCA; Livestock; Manure management; Nitrogen; Uncertainty analysis","Acidification; Ammonia; Climate change; Digital storage; Environmental technology; Fertilizers; Intelligent systems; Mammals; Manures; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrogen; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Circular economy; Denmark; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle assessment model; Livestock; Manure management; Natural conditions; Netherlands; Pig slurries; Regulatory conditions; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135340218

In the last decade, social media and other digital platforms have redefined civic engagement by enabling new ways of connecting, collaborating, and mobilizing. In this article, we examine how technological affordances can both enable and hinder institutional processes through visibilization – which we define as the enactment of technological features to foreground and give voice to particular perspectives and discourses while silencing others. We study such dynamics by examining #SchauHin, an activist campaign initiated in Germany to shine a spotlight on experiences of daily racism. Our findings show how actors and counter-actors differentially leveraged the technological features of two digital platforms to shape the campaign. Our study has implications for understanding the role of digital technologies in institutional processes as well as the interplay between affordances and visibility in efforts to deinstitutionalize discriminatory practices and institutions. © 2022 by Ali Aslan Gümüsay, Mia Raynard, Oana Albu.","Affordances; digital technology; institutional theory; platforms; social media; social movements",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137611510

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on an ethnographic study comprising 5 days of observation of a training course for Danish police officers going to Greenland on summer assistance, 13 days of observation of police work in Greenland, 2 days of participatory observation of a leadership development seminar in Greenland, 26 interviews conducted in Denmark and Greenland with both Danish and Greenlandic officers and interventions in Denmark and Greenland. Findings: The racialized borders create strong perceptions of “us” and “them”, which are maintained and reinforced through everyday work practices. The borders have damaging effects on the way police officers collaborate in Greenland and as the borders are maintained through (often implicit) everyday micro-processes, management has difficulty dealing with it. However, the way the racialized borders became visible through this research project created an awareness of – and sparked conversation about – the colonial stereotypes that have constructed and reinforce the borders. This awareness opens up possibilities of collaborative disruption of those borders. Research limitations/implications: The paper shows how racialized borders limit the way professionalism is understood in the Greenlandic Police Force.

This paper proposes to use two pure, tree-based machine learning models: random forests and gradient boosting, based on the differenced log-mortality rates to produce more accurate mortality forecasts. These forecasts are compared with forecasts from traditional, stochastic mortality models and with forecasts from random forests and gradient boosting variants of the stochastic models. The comparisons are based on the Model Confidence Set procedure. The results show that the pure, tree-based models significantly outperform all other models in the majority of cases considered. To address the lack of interpretability issue associated with machine learning models, we demonstrate how to extract information about the relationships uncovered by the tree-based models. For this purpose, we consider variable importance, partial dependence plots, and variable split conditions. Results from the in-sample fit suggest that tree-based models can be very useful tools for detecting patterns within and between variables that are not commonly identifiable with traditional methods. ©","gradient boosting; model confidence set; Mortality; random forests; stochastic mortality models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139128850

For building life cycle inventories, agricultural processes and activities associated with milk production were mapped out. Three milk production systems in Brazil were assessed, one confined, and two semi-confined, in two different regions, within Minas Gerais and Paraná states. The functional unit used in this study was 1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk. Moreover, an analysis of the environmental performance of milk produced in Brazil with that of milk produced in other parts of the world based on valid EPDs of processed milk was made. LCA results and the results obtained from the valid EPDs used different life cycle impact assessment methods (IPCC 2013; CML, ReCiPE) and impact categories (climate change, acidification potential, eutrophication, formation potential of tropospheric ozone). The raw milk (cradle-to-farm-gate) produced in Brazil (in different states and based on different systems - confined or semi-confined) has lower environmental impacts when associated with those (cradle-to-farm-gate) of published EPDs. The study also briefly compared the results of Brazilian milk production systems with cradle-to-farm-gate LCAs of raw milk found in the literature, and discussed a few strategies for the Brazilian market of milk and dairy products. MPS in Brazil can serve as a benchmark for MPS in other countries, and EPDs can add transparency to business-to-business and business-to-consumer relations. © 2022 The Authors","Dairy; Environmental impacts; Environmental product declaration; Life cycle assessment; Raw milk","Climate change; Dairies; Dairy products; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Cows' milk; Environmental performance; Environmental product declarations; Farm gates; Life cycle assessment; Milk production; Minas Gerais; Production system; Raw milk; Whole milk; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134314820

Such value differences may pose managerial difficulties, making it critical to observe whether working at MNCs changes local employees' cultural values, reducing these differences. This study investigates how and to what extent local employees from a collectivistic culture acculturate their ethics-related values when working at MNCs' foreign subsidiaries. The authors examine (1) whether local employees change their values to become closer to the MNCs' home cultures, and if so, (2) whether the cultural distance between the MNCs' home and host national cultures affect the degree of such adaptation. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected through stratified random sampling from Thai employees of a Japanese-owned MNC (n = 196), a UK-owned MNC (n = 143) and a Thai-owned organisation (n = 137), all operating in Thailand. Hypotheses were developed using Berry's bidimensional acculturation model and were tested using OLS and logistic regression analyses. Findings: The study's findings indicate that MNCs' local employees from collectivistic cultures adopt Berry's integration acculturation strategy and acculturate their ethics-related values – collectivism, ethical relativism, collective responsibility preference and executive pay differentiation tolerance – towards the values prevalent in MNCs' home cultures. Overall, acculturation is greater when cultural distance is greater. New insights are presented in relation to collective responsibility preference and pay differentiation tolerance. Originality/value: Findings add to current knowledge on acculturation in management by (1) providing new insights into value acculturation (2) utilising Berry's acculturation model to analyse employees' acculturation within an organisation in the context of an emerging economy, outside the more frequently studied topic of mergers and acquisitions, and (3) investigating the impact of cultural distance on the degree of employee acculturation outside the field of expatriate adjustment. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Acculturation; Berry's model; Collectivism; Cultural distance; Ethical relativism; Ethics-related values; GLOBE study; MNC employees; Pay differentiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131725742

Until now, it has mainly been described at a theoretical level and is associated with non-specific guidelines in LCA reference documents, thus leaving LCA practitioners with limited guidance prone to inefficient, not transparent, and sometimes inconsistent steps taken in the LCI phase. To tackle this problem, a stepwise data collection guidance is developed based on a critical review of existing guidelines and LCA case studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The guidance encompasses three steps: (i) planning of data collection, including the outlining of LCI blocks, which represent unit processes in an aggregation level that is technology-wise appropriate; (ii) data gathering using the LCI blocks; and (iii) LCI blocks finalization. A customizable, generic LCI template for data collection is provided to facilitate the conduct of steps (i)-(iii). A real-life data collection case of lithium-ion batteries manufacturing is used to demonstrate the guidance's applicability. LCI block datasets were produced using the customized LCI template and the proposed guidance. Cooperation with the case data provider thus enabled to fill the data collection template, which was then reviewed iteratively. Although this case evidences the guidance's operability and its benefits in facilitating and strengthening LCA practice, several constraints undermining reproducibility and transparency could be identified, in particular issues related to data confidentiality. Despite these limitations, which require further efforts from practitioners and more transparency from stakeholders involved in the commission of LCA studies, the authors call for applying the proposed stepwise guidance to enhance future LCA practice. © 2022 The Authors","Data collection; Framework; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle inventory (LCI); Reproducibility; Template","Data acquisition; Lithium-ion batteries; Transparency; Assessment practices; Building technologies; Data collection; Data gathering; Framework; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle inventory; Reproducibilities; Template; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133765751

Because plastic is relatively expensive and may erode and emit microplastics to the environment, efforts are being made to test and develop more sustainable materials. Five alternative locally available biofilter media were compared with commercial plastic media and evaluated in duplicate in 1 m3 two pilot scale Recirculation aquaculture system. Ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite were added to the systems for 4 weeks followed by stocking 20 kg of Nile tilapia in each system. Volumetric total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrite and oxygen conversion rates were assessed for ten weeks. All biofilters with local media matured and reached full capacity after six weeks, while commercial plastic biomedia matured after seven weeks. This study found that the performance of commercial plastic biomedia was similar to performance of coconut shells in terms of volumetric TAN conversion rate (VTR), volumetric nitrite conversion rate (VNR) and volumetric oxygen conversion rate (VOCR). The highest VTR recorded in this study was 599 ± 15.8 g TAN/m3/d from coconut shells while the lowest was 343 ± 8.9 g TAN/m3/d from cattle horns. Biofilters with commercial plastic media had the highest VNR (704 ± 50.3 g NO2–N/m3/d) while media made of cattle horns was the lowest (457 ± 46.1 g NO2–N/m3/d). Biofilters containing coconut shells demonstrated the highest oxygen consumption around 3.0 g/m3/d and biofilters containing charcoal consumed less than 1.0 g/m3/d of oxygen. This study suggests that coconut shells can be used in place of plastic materials in simple recirculation aquaculture system biofiltration. This study also recommends further studies on comparing coconut shells with other biomedia and assessing its effects on water quality parameters and durability. © 2022 The Authors","Biofiltration; Biomedia; Recirculating aquaculture system; TAN removal; Water quality parameters","Ammonia; Biofilters; Charcoal; Chlorine compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Quality control; Shells (structures); Water quality; Wetlands; Ammonia-nitrogen removals; Bio-media; Biofiltrations; Coconut shells; Conversion rates; Recirculating aquaculture system; Total ammonia nitrogen removal; Total ammonia nitrogens; Volumetrics; Water quality parameters; Oxygen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133446152

In the last 20 years, drainage of Asian peat soil has increased to satisfy the demand of land for plantation agricultures. Industrial oil palm plantations occupy large areas of peatland in Indonesia and Malaysia, with associated GHG emissions and biodiversity loss, here referred to as nature occupation impact. This study performs a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of palm oil for two case studies: PT SMART's Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The objective is to quantify the reduction in GHG emissions and nature occupation that has been achieved by implementing the following industry-driven measures: reducing the area of cultivated peat soil, reducing the peat drainage depth, and setting aside part of the land-bank for nature conservation. The results show that 1 kg of palm oil causes 2.72 and 2.25 kg CO2-eq./kg palm oil from Hanau and Sungai Rungau facilities respectively. These are 20%–34% lower than average RSPO certified palm oil and 49%–58% lower than average non-certified palm oil. Sungai Rungau achieves the reduction mainly due to a completely peat soil-free supply base. Hanau's peat emissions are instead 0.28 kg, compared to the 0.77 and 2.36 kg CO2-eq for RSPO certified and non-certified palm oil respectively, due to a very low drainage depth (18–25 cm compared to 57–73 cm in average of RSPO certified and non-certified respectively) and an overall lower share of oil palms on peat land. The impact on nature occupation is 24%–43% lower in Hanau and Sungai Rungau compared to non-certified oil and 4%–29% lower compared to RPSO certified respectively. About 8% of the total land bank of the Hanau supply-base has been set aside for nature conservation, reducing GHG emissions by 2% and nature occupation by 9%. Both Hanau and Sungai Rungau could also significantly reduce GHG emissions in the palm oil milling stage, by implementing biogas capture in palm oil mill effluent (POME) treatment. © 2022 The Author(s)","Carbon footprint; GHG emissions; Life cycle assessment; Palm oil; Peatland","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Conservation; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Employment; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Palm oil; Peat; Soils; % reductions; Drainage depth; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Indonesia; Life cycle assessment; Mitigation measures; Peat land; Peat soils; Supply base; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133573866

Seeking to understand how the bankers cope with this, the paper conducts a qualitative inquiry into the identity work of Danish retail bankers, focusing on the ways in which they reconcile experiences of boredom with their work-identity. Drawing on pragmatic sociology, this reconciliation is conceptualized as individual justifications of boredom through different orders of worth. The paper identifies three justifications of boredom: (1) Projective boredom posits boring administrative tasks as unwanted and problematic. This justification is generally in line with currently dominant empirical and theoretical accounts of the financial sector and finds no justification for boredom, seeking, instead, to eliminate it. (2) Domestic boredom justifies the boring tasks as a duty performed by the humble and respectable banker, who is concerned with their status in the local community and whose sense of pride has been damaged by the many scandals in the sector. Finally, (3) civic boredom justifies boredom as a sacrifice made by the selfless banker who acts in the interest of the common good, understood as a more responsible, and less greedy, financial sector. Here, the meaninglessness of specific tasks is transcended in the service of a higher purpose, which helps the individual sustain an identity as a solidary professional. © The Author(s) 2022.","Boredom; Identity work; Justification; Orders of worth; Retail banking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138678606

We test this framework using data of 136,059 citations to 13,510 patents of climate change mitigation technologies. Complex and complementary technologies tend to be more enabling for subsequent innovation, and this effect is amplified for environmental technologies that constitute dominant designs. Dominant designs generated through a collaborative process, on the other hand, rarely become enabling technologies. We also contribute to climate action by allowing governmental bodies and other investors to direct funding to those innovations that are most likely to make a lasting impact on global warming. In addition, managers and policy makers can foment the antecedents that are most important to incite the development of climate change mitigation technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Dominant design; Eco-innovation; Environmental technologies; Innovation ecosystem; Technological innovation","Ecosystems; Global warming; Patents and inventions; Climate change mitigation; Collaborative process; Conceptual frameworks; Dominant design; Eco-innovation; Enabling technologies; Environmental innovations; Policy makers; Environmental technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138312430

However, most existing literature portrays it as a negative phenomenon for both individuals and organisations. While boredom is studied primarily via controlled laboratory experiments and questionnaire-based studies, past research has been criticised for neglecting to understand workers’ experiences of boredom in real-world work settings. Drawing on a qualitative case study comprising of interviews with prison officers and ethnographic fieldwork in two Danish prisons, this article explores workers’ experience of boredom embedded in specific organisational work practices of repetitive routines, waiting and meaningless tasks. It shows that workers may take an organisational perspective on their experience of boredom, rather than a personal one, acknowledging the tedious features of work but nevertheless emphasising their organisational value. I use a phenomenological approach to sensemaking to deepen the understanding of how workers’ protests against boredom may not be only destructive but may sometimes take creative forms, leading to positive organising. Drawing on these findings, I extend our understanding of boredom at work. © The Author(s) 2022.","emotions; ethnography; phenomenology; prison officers; sensemaking; Simple boredom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138202946

To set the stage for this Special Issue we present an analysis of key research topics, most influential papers and innovation journals, highlighting contributions across four interrelated themes: fostering climate action, shaping policy, promoting experimentation and learning, and examining effectiveness. While past studies and this special issue made significant contributions, we suggest that research on innovation have not sufficiently engaged with three important topics: i) blending behavioural change with technological innovation; ii) the socio-technical drivers of accelerated low-carbon transitions, and iii) the role of digital technologies as new venues of solutions to managerial challenges in addressing climate change. The nexus of climate change and innovation calls for different disciplines and coevolutionary views, as opposed to a traditional disciplinary focused approach. It also may require the need for broader, more inclusive and interdisciplinary research teams. © 2022 The Authors","Climate change; Innovation; Low-carbon transitions; Renewable energy; Sociotechnical transitions","Blending; Carbon; Behavioral changes; Decarbonisation; Historical trends; Innovation; Innovation studies; Low-carbon technologies; Low-carbon transitions; Renewable energies; Research topics; Socio-technical transitions; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136558302

In the search for an appropriate strategic response, firms are currently engaging in a large variety of AI projects. However, recent studies suggest that many companies are falling short in creating tangible business value through AI. As the current scientific body of knowledge lacks empirically-grounded research studies for explaining this phenomenon, we conducted an exploratory interview study focusing on 56 applications of machine learning (ML) in 29 different companies. Through an inductive qualitative analysis, we uncover three broad types and five subtypes of ML value creation mechanisms, identify necessary but not sufficient conditions for successfully leveraging them, and observe that organizations, in their efforts to create value, dynamically shift from one ML value creation mechanism to another by reconfiguring their ML applications (i.e., the shifting practice). We synthesize these findings into a process model of ML value creation, which illustrates how organizations engage in (resource) orchestration by shifting between ML value creation mechanisms as their capabilities evolve and business conditions change. Our model provides an alternative explanation for the current high failure rate of ML projects. © 2022 The Authors","AI strategy; Artificial intelligence (AI); Augmentation; Automation; Interview study; Knowledge creation; machine learning (ML); Value creation mechanisms","Electric grounding; Failure analysis; Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence strategy; Augmentation; Interview study; Knowledge creations; Machine learning; Machine-learning; Process-models; Value creation; Value creation mechanisms; Machine learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134657563

Developed from Simon's notion of bounded rationality, the behavioral model of performance-based learning suggests that managers adjust their understanding of organizational problems, search for information, and consider initiating change when their organization performs below aspirations. In this paper, we offer experimental evidence of how performance information affects the attitudes and decision-making of public managers. We leverage two experiments conducted among managers in public education. Study 1 uses a question-order experiment to prime only treated respondents to consider performance, whereas study 2 uses treatments with high- and low-performance signals. We find that low performance affects problem focus but not managers' intention to conduct innovative search. We also find that low-performance signals increase preferences for immediate performance-oriented changes but not for other types of changes. We discuss the implications for management decision-making. Evidence for Practice: Performance information holds the potential to generate organizational learning and inform public managers' decisions about important problems, priorities, and organizational change. Public managers become more focused on direct performance-oriented changes when performance is low, whereas high performance lets them engage in other types of changes. Performance information alone does not ensure that public managers are focused on generating innovative solutions to performance problems. © 2022 The Authors.

The Scandinavian context is illustrative for reviewing what we term ‘customization devices’ because of its tradition for LDPs with collective reflection, practice orientation, and broad participation. This review curates and synthesizes 31 studies evaluating empirical experiences with customization devices in Scandinavian university-based LDPs from no earlier than 2010. Such devices fall within three key categories, namely theories, cases, and relationships, and have three key effects: distancing from practice, dedicating to the program, and devising future action. Based on our findings, we challenge the dominant view that open enrollment programs cannot adequately mobilize participants’ experiences by theorizing the distinction between open and closed customization. The review further serves as a resource for LDP designers and instructors to carefully choose and mix customization devices that are complementary in their effects. © 2022 The Authors","Customization; Experiential learning theory; Leadership development; Leadership training; Management education; Scandinavian public sector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133893638

The rationale for this provision is to protect personal data and data subject rights by restricting data transfers to countries that may not have the same level of protection as the EEA. However, the ubiquitous and permeable character of new technologies such as cloud computing, and the increased inter-connectivity between societies, has made international data transfers the norm and not the exception. The Schrems II case and subsequent regulatory developments have further raised the bar for companies to comply with complex and, often, opaque rules. Many firms are, therefore, pursuing technology-based solutions in order to mitigate this new legal risk. These emerging technological alternatives reduce the need for open-ended cross-border transfers and the practical challenges and legal risk that such transfers create post-Schrems. This article examines one such alternative, namely a user-held data model. This approach takes advantage of ‘personal data clouds’ that allows data subjects to store their data locally and in a more decentralised manner, thus decreasing the need for cross-border transfers and offering end-users the possibility of greater control over their data. © 2022 Paulius Jurcys, Marcelo Corrales Compagnucci, Mark Fenwick","Cross-border data transfers; GDPR; New standard contractual clauses; Personal data; Personal data clouds; Schrems II; User-generated data; User-held data model","Data privacy; Ubiquitous computing; Cross-border; Cross-border data transfer; Data clouds; General data protection regulations; New standard contractual clause; Personal data cloud; Schrem II; User-generated; User-generated data; User-hold data model; Data transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133883980

This article investigates the mediatization of the civil servant role when moving from their well-known backstage role to a frontstage role. The COVID-19 pandemic is seen as an extreme case, where some civil servants were entitled key, frontstage roles in the handling of the pandemic, compared to their normal backstage role. Thus, the pandemic has created an opportunity to study the frontstage role of civil servants as a form of mediatization. Theoretically, the study provides a conceptual framework for analyzing the mediatized role of the civil servant by linking theories on mediatization and public administration with Goffman’s role theory. Empirically, the article provides an example of a hyper-mediatized civil servant during the extreme case of the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. The article explores how media logic entangles with the logic of bureaucracy, creating a new role for part of the civil service, resulting in governance dilemmas.

Drawing on rational choice theory, we explain why inflexibility, when seen as a constraint, can ultimately not only enhance welfare but also enable cooperation on algorithmic markets. This illuminates the need to address the inflexibility of contracting algorithms in a nuanced manner, distinguishing between inflexibility as a potentially beneficial constraint on the level of transactions, and inflexibility as a set of systemic risks and changes arising in markets employing inflexible contracting algorithms. Using algorithmic trading in financial markets as an example, we show how the automation of finance has brought about institutional changes in the form of new regulation to hedge against systemic risks from inflexibility. Analyzing the findings through the lens of new institutional economics, we explain how widespread adoption of contract automation can put pressure on institutions to change. We conclude with possible lessons that algorithmic finance can teach to markets deploying algorithmic contracting. © 2022 Maria José Schmidt-Kessen, Helen Eenmaa, Maya Mitre","Algorithmic contracts; Algorithmic trading; Computable contracts; Constrained maximization; Constraints; Contract law values; Financial markets; Inflexibility; New institutional economics; Smart contracts","Commerce; Contracts; Financial markets; Algorithmic contract; Algorithmic trading; Algorithmics; Computable contract; Constrained maximization; Constraint; Contract law value; Contract laws; Inflexibility; New Institutional Economics; Automation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133456653

Unique data is collected through structured interviews from 584 strategic business units (SBUs). We find that management control structures in Anglo-Saxon SBUs, relative to those from Germanic and Nordic regions, are more decentralized and participative and place greater emphasis on performance-based pay. Comparing Germanic SBUs to Nordic ones, we find Germanic SBUs to rely more on individual behaviour in performance evaluation, whereas Nordic SBUs rely more on quantitative measures and value alignment in employee selection.

This is done using a factor decomposition analysis framework. The analysis is done at both country aggregate level, and for a set of specific technological topics: alternative energy production, energy conservation, agriculture and forestry, and waste management. Results indicate that there has been a shift at an aggregate level towards environmentally sustainable technologies. In the private sector, the shift can be attributed to changes in research priorities and an increased scale of R&D. In the public sector, increased patenting of environmentally sound technologies can be attributed to efficiency gains. The largest difference between the public and private sector is observed in R&D efficiency, where in the private sector, reductions in efficiency have contributed negatively to patent growth, whereas the opposite is true for the public sector. In both sectors, research focus has shifted towards energy-related technologies. © 2022 The Authors","Environmental innovation; Logarithmic mean divisia index; Patents; Private sector; Public sector; Technological innovation","Forestry; Patents and inventions; Waste management; Divisia index; Eco-innovation; Environmental innovations; Logarithmic mean; Logarithmic mean divisia index; Patent; Private sectors; Public sector; Public-private; Technological innovation; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132217079

Although workplace learning practices of workers in traditional, organisationally embedded jobs have been studied extensively, the findings cannot be transferred to describe and explain learning behaviors within crowdwork, which is fundamentally different from traditional work in that it is autonomous, radically distributed, and no organisationally provided training opportunities exist in crowdwork. To advance the understanding of workplace learning in crowdwork we reviewed the literature on workplace learning, platform work, and self-regulated learning to develop the Workplace Learning in Crowdwork Questionnaire, which we subsequently validated with 992 crowdworkers from six European countries on three crowdwork platforms. The instrument can be used by researchers to study the nature of (self-directed) workplace learning in online labor platforms. It can also be used by crowdworkers to self-reflect on their learning and development. © 2022 The Authors.

In both cases, the role of the diaspora entrepreneurs as channel partners was decisive in providing multistage agility for the exporter while employing their specific market drive and understanding as a source of competitive advantage. While the exporters concentrated on their core business, the partners sensed, seized, and reconfigured resources to enable market entry and growth under culturally and politico-economically demanding conditions. The diasporic understanding of the markets was a unique form of this agility and fundamental for the right strategies and an exporter's international marketing.

This paper contributes to this literature by theorizing complementarity formation mechanisms underlying such positive interactions within and across technology value chains. It pursues empirically founded theory building based on a case study of innovation in battery-electric, hydrogen and liquefied biogas technologies in Norwegian coastal shipping. Three complementarity formation mechanisms in technology value chains are identified: synchronization, amplification, and integration. Synchronization points to the need for co-development between the input and user sectors of a technology value chain. Amplification refers to the necessary expansion of input sectors to match the growing demand in user sectors. Finally, integration highlights the potential of convergence between different technology value chains in one or more user sectors. The paper concludes with a discussion of how policy may leverage such complementarity formation mechanisms to foster innovation in zero‑carbon technologies. © 2022 The Authors","Coastal shipping; Complementarities; Decarbonization; Sustainability transitions; Technology value chain; Zero‑carbon innovation","Ships; Sustainable development; Coastal shipping; Complementarity; Decarbonisation; Formation mechanism; Positive interaction; Sustainability transition; Technology value chain; Value chains; Zero carbons; Zero‑carbon innovation; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131059658

These views also drive the increasing enthusiasm for stakeholder governance, an increased government role in innovation, and the call for new metrics for assessing outcomes, all part of the Great Reset narrative. And yet, concentrating more decision power in the hands of governments, implementing diffuse metrics, and diluting effective ownership can hamper the functioning of markets, encourage crony capitalism, and reduce the resources that are available for dealing with grand challenges.

This builds on an understanding that organizations' innovation is triggered both by deliberate top-down management approaches as well as emergent bottom-up processes. However, little is known on how to effectively plan emergence. In this context, bootlegging has been mentioned as a potential approach, describing instances in which employees choose to innovate without the knowledge and permission of top managers. Whereas past research has focused on the individual employee, we shift the perspective to the overall tendency of bootlegging in organizations. We investigate which organizational conditions facilitate the propensity of bootlegging becoming a widespread practice in an organization, and how this tendency is associated with the organization's innovativeness. Drawing on the theory of creative deviance, we argue that organizations deploying management practices fostering emergent and induced innovation initiatives increase structural strain and thereby bootlegging tendency in such organizations. As more innovation initiatives are elaborated outside the formal process, the number and diversity of ideas outside the strategic scope should increase. Higher bootlegging tendency is thereby proposed to be associated with higher portfolio innovativeness. Empirical evidence from the study of 930 respondents in 124 firms supports the notion that management practices supporting emergent innovation initiatives increase bootlegging tendency, which in turn increases newness of the organization's innovation portfolio. Management practices inducing a particular innovation direction are, in contrast, less prone to trigger structural strain with lesser effects on bootlegging tendencies of the organization. In sum, we contribute to the literature by providing evidence on bootlegging as a promising approach to enable “planned emergence”.

Market studies have produced valuable insights into the role of representations and expectations in the constitution of future markets. However, extant research has been primarily concerned with the ways in which narratives of future markets affect the predictive and calculative capacities of market actors faced with uncertainty. In contrast, this paper draws attention to the social and normative aspects of discursive market future-making. Inspired by work on socio-technical imaginaries (STIs) and visioneering, we investigate how market visioneers such as consultancies, focal industry players, and mainstream media contribute to the “social thickening” of market futures in the context of commercial drones. Based on a qualitative analysis of a corpus of texts (consultancy reports, news media articles, and promotional videos), we uncover four discursive techniques of visioneering through which market futures are socially thickened: presencing, prospecting, problematizing, and entwining futures. Our study extends current theorizing of discursive market making and opens avenues for future research of market visioneering. © The Author(s) 2022.","discourse; expectations; imaginaries; market futures; market shaping; market visioneering; visions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129283771

Key parts of EU health cooperation have, however, long developed more discretely in European administrative networks (EANs) and become core building blocks in the institutional architecture of an EU health policy. In these networks, health experts interact regularly and, by doing so, pool key resources and develop common standards. However, are some network members more influential than others in defining the way forward, and if so, why? In this paper, we examine the structure of networked health cooperation in the case of health technology assessment (HTA), by means of unique survey data and social network analysis, employing exponential random graph models (ERGMs) for different types of interaction. A horizontal structure of interaction fosters cooperation by and for all, whereas a hierarchical structure allows certain members to set agendas and place themselves in a powerful position. We find that the network structure is indeed hierarchical, with some members constituting the core of the network based on their national HTA experience as well as external contact relations. © 2022 The Authors.

The framework is applied to the Circle-House-Project, a cross-sectoral collaborative project aimed at scaling circular economy in the Danish construction sector. The explorative data included desk research and 15 semistructured interviews with expert project partners. The findings were transcribed, structured, coded, condensed, and categorized to provide an illustrative case based on a lighthouse project in the construction sector, affording a novel understanding of how cross-sectoral collaboration can support advancing circular economy practices by developing knowledge-sharing routines and ecocentric dynamic capabilities.

The relevance of these two contexts is theoretically informed by resource dependence, environmental munificence and institutional perspectives. SME decision-makers' attribution of importance to discretionary external links predicts stronger international performance, but this is not the case with core market transactional links.

Controversy surrounds the question of how these transgenerational intentions affect risky growth strategies such as investments in innovation: some emphasize the positives of a transgenerational time horizon for investments in future growth, others highlight the negatives of a more conservative mindset with amplified concern for stability and risk avoidance. Using regulatory focus theory, we resolve this long-standing controversy about the impact of transgenerational intentions by theorizing how they can trigger a promotion focus with increased innovation spending or a prevention focus with reduced innovation spending, depending on the firm’s survival hazard. Based on a sample of around 3,900 German firms using OLS and 2SLS estimation, we find empirical support for our predictions.

However, prior research largely ignores the agency of foreign MNC subsidiaries receiving government R&D subsidies from their host countries. Subsidiaries may increase R&D investments and innovation outputs as intended by governments or merely accept the additional funds while continuing R&D programs that they would have undertaken anyway. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether R&D subsidies trigger additional input, output, and behavioral innovation effects in foreign MNC subsidiaries. Based on longitudinal data from Germany, we find that foreign MNC subsidiaries increase their R&D investments more than comparable domestic firms in response to an R&D subsidy. Moreover, MNC subsidiaries experience comparatively stronger effects in innovation performance from subsidy-induced R&D. However, subsidies also shift attention away from the subsidiaries’ original R&D activities. We interpret our findings by integrating theory from subsidy additionality literature into models of MNC subsidiary innovation.

In business-economic terms, the metaphor has inspired IS research into new business models, while in engineering terms, it has led to important insights into the design and governance of digital platforms. Studying digital ecosystems in these terms, however, makes it difficult to trace and explain those effects of digitalization, which do not materialize predominantly in economic and engineering patterns. Important relationships and their effects may therefore go unnoticed. In response, I draw on the ecological epistemology of Gregory Bateson and others to contribute an ecological approach to digital ecosystems. Such an understanding, I argue, expands the possibilities for tracing and explaining the wide-reaching, boundary-crossing effects of digitalization and the runaway dynamics they may lead to. I suggest to do this based on three principles: (1) part-of-ness—phenomena are to be observed as always part of a larger ecosystem; (2) systemic wisdom—ecosystems have limits, which need to be respected; and (3) information ecology—ecosystems are not mechanical but informed, cognitive systems. As my contribution, I propose six avenues for future IS research into digital ecology. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2021.","digital ecology; Digital ecosystems; ecological thinking; future IS research; Gregory Bateson; responsible digitalization","Cognitive systems; Bateson; Business economics; Digital ecology; Digital ecosystem; Ecological principles; Ecological thinking; Future IS research; Gregory bateson; New business models; Responsible digitalization; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119519930

To ensure a smooth reverse flow, our model determines a return rate for each customer zone with respect to the consumers’ environmental awareness and the optimal acquisition price offered for returned products. Considering the environmental awareness levels and optimal green levels, specific cost and price functions for green products are proposed. Further, government subsidy as a financial incentive for manufacturers is considered to make the model more realistic and challenging. The effectiveness of the proposed model is analyzed by an illustrative example generated based on an Iranian straw factory. Beneficial managerial insights are obtained by conducting several sensitivity analyses. Further, the illustrative example and several generated examples in all scales are assessed by Sine Cosine Crow Search Algorithm using an efficient solution representation based on the priority-based encoding. As there is no benchmark available in the related literature to validate the results of Sine Cosine Crow Search Algorithm and to evaluate its performance, Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm are utilized to solve the examples.

Consequently, companies face nowadays a great data governance challenge, i.e. to restore the consumer’s positive sentiment while continuing to explore Big Data. Hence, we have conducted a multi-method enquiry with foci on the Danish market covering the topic of digital footprint’s awareness. This was fashioned with a descriptive-exploratory research purpose, to understand the sentiment (perception) and the behavior (action) of the data-owners and data-brokers surrounding the dataveillance over personal lives. Results confirmed a generalized inability to minimize risks of data misuse. A new insight for Marketeers is the willingness of some respondents to pay for security services and thus safeguard their privacy (disbelieved of the regulatory compliance system). A perception-behavior gap is noticed on the distress with the exposure of personal information and the paradoxical low self-defensiveness. Likewise, data-brokers admit the deliberate use (perception) of imitation strategies (e.g. hyper-targeting; algorithmic refinement; and, predictive modeling) for maintaining a competitive parity with other firms, which contrasts with the institutional isomorphism (inaction) to interrupt them. Given the relevance of this discussion (and our conclusions) for policy-making, managers (inclusively marketing professionals) and citizens, is recommended the deepening of this research line in the region, especially in Nordic countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Big data; Consumer’s sentiment; Denmark; Digital footprints; GDPR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118624192

However, little empirical research has related corporate social responsibility (CSR) to brand authenticity and brand authenticity to customers’ positive word-of-mouth.

We address these shortcomings in the literature drawing on data from 1,101 customers of insurance services brands and analyze them using structural equation modeling. The findings show that CSR is positively related to customers’ positive word-of-mouth, both directly and indirectly, through brand authenticity. Moreover, alternative attractiveness positively moderates the effect of CSR on brand authenticity. This implies that CSR can act as a differentiation mechanism to further enhance the focal brand’s authenticity, when an alternative brand is perceived as highly attractive. © The Author(s) 2021.","alternative attractiveness; brand authenticity; corporate social responsibility; structural equation modeling; word-of-mouth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118438357

We develop strategies to address those tensions and a theoretical model that delineates the interactions of these three areas for superior performance on international assignments.

Five game structures are considered in examining the impacts of power structures on the optimal price and green level decisions and the corresponding equilibrium decisions. A two-way revenue-sharing contract is proposed from the perspective of improving the performance of each member. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the results and gain managerial insights for green product manufacturing and selling in a competitive market. The results demonstrate that the two competing manufacturers need to cooperate rather than compete if cross-price elasticity or the difference between market potentials is too high. In this scenario, the equilibrium outcome can outperform the overall green supply chain’s performance compared to those achieved under the Bertrand or Nash game. The retailer also receives benefits. Due to a higher variation in market size and price sensitivity, the retailer may receive higher profits under the manufacturer’s leadership and vice versa. Therefore, the results contradict the common consensus. Although greening levels remain higher if the retailer dominates or the members have equal power, every member can receive suboptimal profits in these scenarios. It is found that a two-way revenue-sharing contract mechanism based on product market sizes can improve the overall green supply chain’s performance and allocate profit surplus arbitrarily. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coordination; Game theory; Green supply chain management; Price and greening level-based competition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109367469

However, most existing literature focuses on the symbolic dimension of taint – particularly, dirty workers’ cognitive, ideological tactics to counter taint. Although contamination has more material consequences, the processes through which it is experienced and contained in dirty work have not yet been well explicated. Drawing on an ethnographic study of work in two Danish prisons, this article offers an opportunity to see behind the walls and gain insight into the extreme emotional dirty work of prison officers as they face burdensome emotional encounters with manipulative and intimidating inmates. As society’s agent in the containment of inmates’ emotional dirt, officers, as emotional labourers, risk contamination if they give in to inmates’ pressure and manipulation and do them illicit favours. I use embodied phenomenology as an original and fertile approach to deepen the understanding of how contamination occurs in emotional dirty work and the bodily responses that workers engage in to resist it. Drawing on these findings, I extend our understanding of emotional dirty work. © The Author(s) 2021.","contamination; dirty work; embodied phenomenology; emotions; ethnography; prison officers","article; contamination; correctional staff; drawing; ethnography; fear; human; human experiment; occupation; phenomenology; prisoner; shoulder; stigma; thinking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106223720

This paper aims to extend the general-sentiment dictionary in Chinese to a restaurant-domain-specific dictionary, visualize spatiotemporal sentiment trends, identify the main discrete emotions that affect customers’ ratings in a restaurant setting and identify constituents of influential emotions. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 683,610 online restaurant reviews downloaded from Dianping.com were analyzed by a sentiment dictionary optimized by the authors; the main emotions (joy, love, trust, anger, sadness and surprise) that affect online ratings were explored by using multiple linear regression methods. After tracking these sentiment review texts, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and LDA models with term frequency-inverse document frequency as weights were used to find the factors that constitute influential emotions. Findings: The results show that it is viable to optimize or expand sentiment dictionary by word similarity. The findings highlight that love and anger have the highest effect on online ratings. The main factors that constitute consumers’ anger (local characteristics, incorrect food portions and unobtrusive location) and love (comfortable dining atmosphere, obvious local characteristics and complete supporting services) are identified. Different from previous studies, negativity bias is not observed, which poses a question of whether it has to do with Chinese culture. Practical implications: These findings can help managers monitor the true quality of restaurant service in an area on time. Based on the results, restaurant operators can better decide which aspects they should pay more attention to; platforms can operate better and can have more manageable webpage settings; and consumers can easily capture the quality of restaurants to make better purchase decisions. Originality/value: This study builds upon the existing general sentiment dictionary in Chinese and, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, is the first to provide a restaurant-domain-specific sentiment dictionary and use it for analysis. It also reveals the constituents of two prominent emotions (love and anger) in the case of restaurant reviews. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Latent Dirichlet allocation; Online reviews; Restaurant; Restaurant domain lexicon; Sentiment analysis; Text-mining",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130541928

The authors identify current trends, analyse and critique the key topics of research and discuss the future of this nascent field of inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: This study’s analysis combined a structured literature review with citation analysis, topic modelling using a machine learning approach and a manual review of selected articles. The corpus comprised 153 academic papers from two ranked journal lists, the Association of Business Schools (ABS) and the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC), and from the Social Science Research Network (SSRN). From this, the authors analysed and critiqued the current and future research trends in the four most predominant topics of research in blockchain for accounting. Findings: Blockchain is not yet a mainstream accounting topic, and most of the current literature is normative. The four most commonly discussed areas of blockchain include the changing role of accountants; new challenges for auditors; opportunities and challenges of blockchain technology application; and the regulation of cryptoassets. While blockchain will likely be disruptive to accounting and auditing, there will still be a need for these roles. With the sheer volume of information that blockchain records, both professions may shift out of the back-office toward higher-profile advisory roles where accountants try to align competitive intelligence with business strategy, and auditors are called on ex ante to verify transactions and even whole ecosystems. Research limitations/implications: The authors identify several challenges that will need to be examined in future research. Challenges include skilling up for a new paradigm, the logistical issues associated with managing and monitoring multiple parties all contributing to various public and private blockchains, and the pressing need for legal frameworks to regulate cryptoassets. Practical implications: The possibilities that blockchain brings to information disclosure, fraud detection and overcoming the threat of shadow dealings in developing countries all contribute to the importance of further investigation into blockchain in accounting. Originality/value: The authors’ structured literature review uniquely identifies critical research topics for developing future research directions related to blockchain in accounting. © 2021, Tatiana Garanina, Mikko Ranta and John Dumay.","Accounting; Blockchain; Future trends; Literature review; Machine-learning approach",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118234010

This paper investigates the relevant techno-economic implications from a shipowner's perspective and estimates the effect of six compliance options on six sample containerships. The study applies a new evidence-based bottom-up approach, and the results show that compliance, when possible, is not straightforward and costly. Engine power limitation is the most cost-effective option, but low power limits can lead to substantially increased sailing times (up to 793.92 h/year), which can be prohibitive.

We aimed to characterize the anti-methanogenic properties of 12 Nordic macroalgae species (eight brown, three red, and one green). Differences in the chemical composition across two harvesting seasons and impacts of addition of macroalgae (20% dry matter basis) on in vitro rumen fermentability of maize silage (MS) and associated changes in the rumen microbiome composition were also evaluated. Green and red macroalgae contained twice as much crude protein (CP) as compared to brown macroalgae. The latter had higher mineral and total polyphenol content (TPC: 10 to 20 times). In some brown species, ash and CP contents were up to twice as high in spring than in autumn, but TPC was highest in autumn. The TPC content was inversely correlated with in vitro rumen fermentation characteristics: organic matter (OM) degradability (r = −0.85; P &lt; 0.001), production of total gas (r = −0.79; P &lt; 0.001), total volatile fatty acids (r = −0.78; P &lt; 0.001) and CH4 (r = −0.53; P &lt; 0.03) per gram of OM. The polyphenol-rich brown species, Fucus vesiculosus and Ascophyllum nodosum, caused a significant reduction in feed degradability (∼25%) due to the suppression of cellulolytic bacteria (Ruminococcus spp., Lacnospiraceae spp., Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group) in the rumen fluid after fermentation. Interestingly, autumn-harvested samples of those two macroalgae decreased the CH4 production by 62.6% and 48.2%, respectively, and reduced rumen methanogenic archaea (e.g., Methanobrevibacter spp.), although the reduction was not directly correlated with TPC. Thus, Nordic macroalgae, depending upon their species-specific unique properties, could be utilized as anti-methanogenic feed additives or feeding resources for ruminants. In vivo studies are needed to establish the implications of feeding with these macroalgae on overall animal performance. © 2022 The Authors","Methane; Polyphenols; Rumen degradation; Rumen microbiota; Seaweeds","Additives; Degradation; Fermentation; Mammals; Volatile fatty acids; CH 4; Chemical compositions; Macro-algae; Microbiome; Microbiotas; Polyphenols; Property; Rumen degradation; Rumen fermentations; Rumen microbiota; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131464094

In real world, knowledge graphs (KGs) are dynamic and evolve over time with addition or deletion of triples. However, most existing models focus on embedding static KGs while neglecting dynamics. To adapt to the changes in a KG, these models need to be retrained on the whole KG with a high time cost. In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned problem, we propose a new context-aware Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embedding (DKGE) method which supports the embedding learning in an online fashion. DKGE introduces two different representations (i.e., knowledge embedding and contextual element embedding) for each entity and each relation, in the joint modeling of entities and relations as well as their contexts, by employing two attentive graph convolutional networks, a gate strategy, and translation operations. This effectively helps limit the impacts of a KG update in certain regions, not in the entire graph, so that DKGE can rapidly acquire the updated KG embedding by a proposed online learning algorithm. Furthermore, DKGE can also learn KG embedding from scratch. Experiments on the tasks of link prediction and question answering in a dynamic environment demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DKGE. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic embedding; Knowledge graph; Online learning","E-learning; Graph embeddings; Vector spaces; Dimensional vectors; Dynamic embedding; Embeddings; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graphs; Low dimensional; Online learning; Real-world; Static knowledge; World knowledge; Knowledge graph",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131418179

However, there is a dearth of research on how innovations can be diffused within open innovation ecosystems, a critical condition for the sustainability of such ecosystems. In this regard, the study advances a research agenda for guiding future inquiries into innovation diffusion within open innovation ecosystems. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a systematic review of the extant literature on open innovation, this article identifies knowledge gaps in innovation diffusion, along with recommendations for bridging these gaps in the future. The study advocates that future research should consider not only innovation generation processes, but also innovation diffusion processes, especially in light of the growing application of open innovation in the context of digital goods and services. Findings: Subscribing to an evolutionary view of innovation diffusion, the article draws on a five-phase framework – knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation – to illustrate the roles played by three distinct yet interconnected parties (i.e. platforms, complementors, and individuals) within open innovation ecosystems as well as the research opportunities it brings.

The implementation of Circular Economy (CE) has the potential to reduce waste by encouraging reuse of resources in a closed loop. Given that designers are involved in the design process, this paper investigates whether they are properly equipped to take responsibility for the shift toward CE. A group of professional designers from the field of retail design were therefore interviewed, with a view to discovering and understanding impediments to the implementation of CE; the study presents a snapshot of these designers' knowledge of CE. It identifies categories of drivers and barriers to CE, as seen from the designer's perspective; shows conflicting interests within these categories; describes the interaction of collaborators; and, finally, suggests roles that each of these players might be expected to play in an eventual transition to CE. Findings suggest that while designers understand their responsibility in accomplishing this transition, they lack tools and confidence to engage in the recycling process. Despite being enthusiastic about CE and recognizing the need for change, they do not reckon themselves capable of leading that transition. © 2022","Circular economy; Collaborators; Designer role; Ecosystem.; Green marketing; Retail and hospitality design","Design; Circular economy; Closed-loop; Collaborator; Design phase; Design-process; Designer role; Ecosystem.; Green marketing; Retail and hospitality design; Reuse; Sales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130947186

To fill this gap, the authors answer the question: “How do firms' sustainability actions affect their SCs' resilience and sustainability trajectories in turbulent environments?"" by exploring the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted 10 case studies in five industries located in six European countries. A total of 19 semi-structured interviews and relevant secondary data were collected and analyzed in reference to SC sustainability learning and the literature on SCRes approaches (i.e. engineering, ecological and social-ecological). Findings: 31 SC actions referring to different sustainability dimensions were identified to map SCRes learning through a temporal, spatial and functional scale analysis. While five cases are related to an engineering approach focused on “bouncing back” to pre-pandemic goals, three cases were focused on “bouncing forward” as part of an ecological approach. Moreover, the authors identified the existence of two social-ecological resilience cases which developed long-term actions, updating functional set-ups transcending the SC level. The results furthermore illustrate an influence of the SCRes approaches on SC sustainability learning, generating three different paths: flat, flat ascending and ascending SC sustainability trajectories. Research limitations/implications: The study develops an overview of the adoption of SCRes approaches due to temporal, spatial and functional scales, and their effect on SC sustainability trajectories through exploitation and exploration capabilities. Future research should elaborate on potential moderators in the proposed relationships. Practical implications: A better understanding of the link between SC sustainability actions and SCRes will help practitioners to make better informed decisions in turbulent environments. Originality/value: Unlike previous research, this paper provides empirical evidence on engineering, ecological and social-ecological SCRes approaches, as well as SC sustainability trajectories. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19 pandemic; ecological resilience; Engineering resilience; Social-ecological resilience; Supply chain resilience; Sustainability trajectories",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130519287

This article aims to understand how supreme audit institutions (SAIs) operate to maintain and nurture the political neutrality and legitimacy of their PA. Design/methodology/approach: The authors draw on Suchman's typology on legitimacy (1995) to analyze the PA reports of two countries with a long history of both performance auditing and accusations of political interference, namely Canada and Denmark. Documentary analysis and interview methods are employed. Findings: This study shows how the two SAIs have been pursuing pragmatic, moral and cognitive legitimacy through the professionalization and standardization of both the form and the content of their PA reports. Engaging and maintaining the dialogue with the audited administration, triangulating recognized social science methods, and emphasizing the “public interest” basis of PA reflect some of the tools adopted to navigate the “grey zone” between objective, relevant and politically sensitive audits. Research limitations/implications: The paper's explorative approach limits the possibility for robust testing of the causal forces impinging on SAIs' choices of legitimation strategies. Nevertheless, variations between the Canadian and Danish SAIs in the strategic use of some legitimacy tools such as the media suggest a difference in the role of Public Accounts Committee in the two countries that can be investigated in future research. Originality/value: Much research exists questioning the political neutrality of PA, yet there has not been much discussion on how SAIs have been able to develop and preserve the prevalent legitimacy of their PA amid the criticism. More specifically, our research reveals the tendency of both the Canadian and Danish SAIs to strategically underline the “public interest” dimension of their performance audits in an attempt to increase both their legitimacy and political neutrality. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Legitimacy; Performance audit; Political neutrality; Supreme audit institutions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122676825

We ask: Are investors “failure-averse” and discount a failed entrepreneur even in the presence of additional information about entrepreneurial skill? Or do they make “rational inferences” in light of the additional skill information and proceed to fund the new startup? To test whether investors are failure-averse or engage in rational inference, we use experiments in the context of equity crowdfunding.

An allocation scheme specifies how revenues are distributed, as the hierarchy evolves. We obtain schemes that are socially optimal and initiator-optimal, respectively. Our results have potential applications for blockchain, cryptocurrencies, social mobilization, and multilevel marketing. © 2021 INFORMS.","blockchain; hierarchies; multi-level marketing; Nash equilibrium; optimal allocation schemes","Blockchain; Commerce; Block-chain; Hierarchy; Joint ventures; Multi-level marketing; Multilevels; Nash equilibria; Optimal allocation; Optimal allocation scheme; Optimal management; Private information; Marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137863128

We assess if ERIC has a better ability to predict stock returns than earnings, cash flow from operations (CFO), earnings before extraordinary items (EBEI), residual income (RI), or economic value added (EVA). We evaluate data from 214 companies listed on the U.S. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index from 2003 to 2012 (2354 firm-year observations). Similar to previous studies, we confirm that CFO and EBEI have the strongest association with stock returns in the short term, while EVA trails behind all other metrics. In terms of new findings, ERIC is the best predictor of stock returns over a 5-year period, as well as during times of crises (from 2009 to 2010). In this period, ERIC also adds incremental information content beyond that of EBEI. However, the low-short-/mid-term predictive ability of shareholder value metrics (EVA, ERIC) raises concerns regarding their reliable use in future research on shareholder value creation. We consequently propose a research agenda that focuses less on the measurement and more on the management of shareholder value. © 2022 by the authors.","earnings less risk-free interest charge; economic value added; incremental information content; relative information content; shareholder value; value-based management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136706366

To prevent accidents, construction workers receive occupational safety training and safety instructions. However, experience-based learning of dangerous situations is hardly possible or justifiable in reality. Virtual reality (VR) simulations can be a potential solution in this regard by allowing workers to experience dangerous situations in a very vivid but safe way without being exposed to real hazards. In this study, a VR simulation for construction safety training was developed and tested with trainees that learn the safe operation of hand-operated power tools. In this particular case study, the objective for the participants in the VR simulation was to successfully consider all safety aspects in the operation of an angle grinder. The usability, user experience and implicit learning were investigated during the study. Additionally, we conducted post-play interviews with participants. Results found learning effects of participants as well as a satisfying user experience and usability. The results also show that participants might learn content as presented, risking the learning of false information if the simulation does not cover relevant safety aspects. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","Construction Site Safety and Health; Training Simulations; Usability; User Experience; Virtual Reality","Accidents; Construction industry; E-learning; Occupational risks; Usability engineering; Construction safety; Construction site safety; Construction site safety and health; Learning effects; Safety and healths; Safety training; Training simulation; Usability; Users' experiences; Virtual reality simulations; Virtual reality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135612402

Findings indicate that agile adaptation and new opportunity utilization were the primary means of dealing with the disruptions the COVID-19 pandemic brought about. These findings indicate effective utilization of sensing and seizing capabilities and engagement with opportunity recognition and discovery to capture opportunities and deal with the impact of the pandemic on their businesses. The results further suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 triggered a fight-or-flight survival instinct among B2B SMEs due to unprecedented levels of market uncertainty. As such, the sensing capability of B2B SMEs allowed them to identify the market threats and opportunities and understand the prevailing market situation. Accordingly, B2B SMEs seized the identified threats and opportunities by reconfiguring their business models and face-to-face and online operations. The digital technologies facilitated the online presence and promoted communication with existing and new customers.

Our approach combines insights from narrative theory and the sociology of anticipatory modes of engagement with the future. We applied a mixed method approach to analyze 166 letters from a creative writing exercise where residents from five countries was asked to write retrospectively from the viewpoint of a desired post-corona future. Using the methodology of Digital Story Grammar, we first categorized the letters given their grammatical structure in terms of who are in stories (characters), what the stories are about (type of action), and to what or whom were the actions directed to (objects for the character's actions). This resulted in four writing styles: (1) analytical-observational, (2) collective-moral, (3) dialogical-personal, and (4) sensory-emotional. Consequently, we interpreted the four writing styles qualitatively in relation to the theory of modes of engagement with the future (i.e., familiarity, plans, exploration, and justification). We conclude by reflecting on the relationships between writing styles and modes in a multi-paradigmatic approach to the study of anticipation and the relevance to scenario-building practices. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anticipation; Anticipatory functions, narrative; Digital story grammar; Modes of engagement with the future; Writing style","education; language; student; teaching; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134488866

These characteristics pose research challenges that require utilizing sophisticated research designs and methodologies. This paper and our focused issue on ‘The use of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and complementary methods in IM research’ further clarify whether and how researchers using PLS-SEM can address (some of) the challenges in IM research. We explain how researchers can benefit from the (advanced) capabilities that PLS-SEM offers; either as a stand-alone method or in triangulation efforts that leverage complementary approaches. In addition, we review the IM literature for PLS-SEM applications and evaluate whether and how researchers are already using these approaches. We identify some room for improvement when it comes to the application of both more advanced PLS-SEM capabilities and the triangulation of PLS-SEM with qualitative data analyses, and techniques such as fuzzy set qualitative comparative analyses and necessary condition analyses. For better guidance, we refer to PLS-SEM application examples in which the methodological advances are used. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134469653

Within the servitization domain, however, they are only starting to receive attention. This paper explores the tensions that industrial firms encounter when attempting to integrate services and solutions into their offerings. Following an exploratory multiple case study approach, we identify several tensions experienced at the intra- and interorganizational levels by three industrial firms. By drawing on the four flows model—activity coordination, organizational self-structuring, institutional positioning, and membership negotiation—we identify tensions at the intersection of the flows. The findings elucidate how many of the identified tensions become knotted and movement across organizational levels is created through communicative processes. We make contributions to the literature by drawing on communicative processes to explain how paradoxical tensions emerge within a servitization context and become entangled. As servitizing firms move toward offering advanced services, they are likely to face an increasing number of tensions spanning intra- and interorganizational levels. Our study raises important implications as inextricable entanglements between tensions creates complexity, which requires managers to focus more clearly on the challenge of coping with these on an ongoing basis. © 2022 The Authors","Communication; Communication as constitutive of organization (CCO); Paradox; Servitization; Tensional knot; Tensions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133836767

However, research has not examined which B2B marketing capabilities are most influential across developed and emerging economies from a firm performance view. Selecting the most potentially relevant marketing capabilities is driven by an executive panel and prior literature. Drawing on the crossvergence phenomenon, this study presents an empirical test of a parsimonious conceptual model, identifying the key capabilities driving customer satisfaction, sales revenue, and profitability at the strategic business unit (SBU) level. Using data from 702 senior managers in the United States (US), Denmark, and Chile, the authors find the convergence and divergence of B2B marketing capabilities influence. In particular, the results indicate that three capabilities are universal to marketing practice: (1) segmentation and targeting capability as the baseline for cultivating a higher-order marketing capability; (2) pricing capability as the main driver of SBU profitability; and (3) new offering development capability as the key driver of SBU customer satisfaction. Building over the findings, the study suggests that political view on the market, industry structure, and the more rational nature of B2B firms seem to be the pivotal tenets of the marketing capabilities convergence. © 2022 The Authors","Advanced economies; Business-to-business; Chile; Crossvergence; Emerging economies; Marketing capabilities",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133659860

The specific market timing, pricing scheme and demand response program decide in which way consumers receive and react to incentives. Aside from pricing, several other parameters were found to greatly influence consumer response. Policy makers can improve the market design of wholesale and balancing markets. This would be a necessary tool to increase the demand side flexibility, but could also be used to allow better forecasts of production. Here, the impact of lead time on the flexibility of consumers is investigated and its impact on social welfare is estimated. The price elasticity of consumers can vary in different ways depending on the lead time and estimations may be uncertain. Therefore, the concept of a demand flexibility gap is proposed in order to quantify how the uncertainty of consumers’ responses may affect the social welfare of such a policy change. We recommend that lead time should be considered in electricity market design, e.g., in consecutive ahead markets in order to tap the full potential of flexibility from the demand side. © 2022 The Authors","Demand response; Electricity market design; Flexible consumers; Lead time; Price elasticity; Wind power integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133540434

By questioning the prediction and control framework, uncertainty and complexity create both opportunities for new policy framings to emerge and challenges to the current role of institutions. We identify three balancing acts. First, there is the challenge of acknowledging the limits of the govern-ability of the future while retaining a role for governing agents. Second, the interface with policy leads to the selection of policy-relevant evidence that may be in tension with creating an inclusive space for the plurality of legitimate but often contrasting, perspectives at the interface with society. Third, there is a tension between the expectation that policy recommendations be formulated to solve existing problems and the new questions and processes that are opened when taking uncertainty and complexity into account. The paper takes as its case study the policy recommendations formulated by the European Environment Agency about sustainability transitions. Results show that the innovative and disruptive suggestions, which are made in the main text, are very much nuanced when it comes to policy recommendations and part of the transformative power of these concepts is lost through the balancing of opposing institutional needs. The value of the report lies not necessarily in the practical advice it formulates but in the more modest contribution of giving visibility to debates about uncertainty and complexity. Sustainability transition concepts serve as gatekeepers for new debates and new narratives to develop if sustained in time. Opportunities windows for new debates to emerge, however, may close fast. © 2022 The Authors","Complexity; Post-normal science; Science-policy interface; Sustainability transitions; Uncertainty","complexity; future prospect; institutional framework; prediction; sustainability; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132917961

This paper focuses on due diligence in the context of conflict mineral supply chains, and in doing so provides important insights for modern slavery in general. Using more than 38 h of recordings from exploratory interviews with 46 experts from 43 organizations, our study investigates: a) how due diligence costs and benefits are actually distributed in supply chains in practice; and b) the means through which due diligence costs and benefits can be (more appropriately) shared. We find that there is a lack of contextualization of cost-sharing mechanisms to conflict mineral supply chains, with most mechanisms being imported from the standard business literature where the producer must pay the production costs before reaping the benefits that offset these costs. But in conflict mineral supply chains, these benefits often do not materialize for the producer and, consequently, cost-sharing mechanisms lead to unintended consequences. The findings question the usefulness of due diligence, call for alternative financing mechanisms, and for contextualized solutions designed from the bottom up. This in turn has important implications for enhancing legislation on modern slavery. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Conflict minerals; Corporate social responsibility; Cost sharing; Modern slavery; Supply chain due diligence; Unintended consequences","corporate social responsibility; legislation; slave; slavery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132721893

We argue that progress can be made in global strategy by recognizing this distinction and exploring the interaction between “strategizing” and “economizing.” To lend credence to this claim, we offer a simple model of the entry decision which highlights both economizing and strategizing aspects of this decision. We also offer recommendations on economizing-strategizing research in global strategy. Managerial summary: Multinational enterprises gain competitive advantage either by improving the efficiency with which they operate (by having unique resources, lowering costs, or improving managerial practices) or by exercising their market and bargaining power. Most research has emphasized the former source of competitive advantage. However, in actuality, the two sources are intertwined. We detail how they are intertwined by means of a simple numerical example of the entry decision facing a company that can choose between competing or collaborating with the local firm. We show that strategizing plays into the entry decision in this case. © 2022 The Authors.

The complex connections between cities and pandemics, however challenge traditional approaches to reviewing literature. In this article we adopted a rapid review methodology. We review the historical literature on respiratory pandemics and their documented connections to urban planning and design (both broadly defined as being concerned with cities as complex systems). Our systematic search across multidisciplinary databases returned a total of 1323 sources, with 92 articles included in the final review. Findings showed that the literature represents the multi-scalar nature of cities and pandemics – pandemics are global phenomena spread through an interconnected world, but require regional, city, local and individual responses. We characterise the literature under ten themes: scale (global to local); built environment; governance; modelling; non-pharmaceutical interventions; socioeconomic factors; system preparedness; system responses; underserved and vulnerable populations; and future-proofing urban planning and design. We conclude that the historical literature captures how city planning and design intersects with a public health response to respiratory pandemics. Our thematic framework provides parameters for future research and policy responses to the varied connections between cities and respiratory pandemics. © 2022 The Authors","Cities; COVID-19; Human health; Pandemics; Urban design; Urban planning","COVID-19; globalization; governance approach; health status; literature review; socioeconomic impact; urban design; urban planning; urban policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132378432

However, empirical evidence on its effect is scarce and anecdotal. Based on the observation that customers assess the “privacy vs. service/benefit” trade-off in a calculative way, this study examines how customers' privacy concerns affect their price sensitivity and in turn, the provider's profitability. Specifically, we propose value-based selling as an approach for providers to alleviate the potential negative effects of customers' privacy concerns. The results of a sample of 250 US firms confirm value-based selling's power to disable the privacy concerns–price sensitivity mechanism and mitigate the negative effect of price sensitivity on product-service system provider profitability. However, value-based selling's positive impact on performance is dependent on the level of contract specificity. Thus, value-based selling and contract specificity are complementary arrangements. © 2022 The Authors","Contract specificity; Hybrid offerings; Product service systems; Servitization; Solution selling; Value-based selling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131433685

Building on the ecosystem concept and integrative branding theory, this research offers an evolving three-stage process model to guide actors in restoring an ecosystem brand suffering from the lack of innovativeness and public disapproval. Using data from 51 informants in three key groups of actors: (1) citizens, (2) firms, and (3) authorities, as well as complementary sources, this study uncovers a nuanced pattern of interplay between the different ecosystem actors. The findings show that the restoration of an ecosystem brand is possible through (1) reframing, (2) blending, and (3) proacting. These stages are driven by a single-actor, dyadic, and triadic focus on sustainability-led innovation.

Drawing on pioneering theories of political violence, social psychological research on relative deprivation, and prospect theory from behavioral economics, we examine individual-level processes that underpin the relationship between inequality and political violence. We present two arguments: despite being a key explanatory variable in existing research, perceived lower economic status vis-à-vis other individuals (an indicator of relative deprivation) is unlikely to motivate people to participate in violence; by contrast, although virtually unexplored, a projected decrease in one’s own economic status (prospective decremental deprivation) is likely to motivate violence. Multilevel analyses of probability samples from many African countries provide evidence to support these claims. Based on this, we posit that focusing on changes in living conditions, rather than the status quo, is key for understanding political violence. © The Author(s) 2022.","civil conflict; decremental deprivation; economic inequality; individual-level analysis; political violence; prospect theory; relative deprivation; social psychology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131379536

Unlike universities and other national research institutes, BSOs are unique scientific organizations by virtue of their sheer size, level of complexity, and uncertainty with respect to the outcomes of research and development. BSOs involve large networks of suppliers and collaborators in science, government, and business, constituting a complex system with permeable boundaries that offer opportunities for technology transfer, knowledge accumulation, and business creation. Hence, BSOs are influential players within complex systems of innovation, learning, and business creation. Despite their important role for national and international economies as well as society at large, our current understanding of their management and impact is underdeveloped in both theory and practice. We know less about the challenges and opportunities for innovation and entrepreneurship in a context of changing economic, technological, and societal environments that arise in the broader ecosystem surrounding BSOs. To address this void of research, we made this special issue to focus on innovation and entrepreneurship around BSOs to create a richer foundation for future conceptual and empirical research on science management and innovation. The work included in this special issue offers some new insights regarding innovation and entrepreneurship in the context of BSOs. To embed these individual findings into existing research, we provide a comprehensive overview regarding innovation involving BSOs capturing the full picture of the fundamental issues in this regard.

First, a Product Space analysis identifies industrial niches, which Tanzania should promote to increase economic complexity and stimulate structural transformation. The identification of industries is based on a supply-side network method following the literature on economic complexity. Second, we combine the complexity analysis with a gravity model, identifying industries with high, demand-driven export potential. In combination, the supply-and-demand framework finds industries that are complex, feasible to target given Tanzania's existing know-how and profitable to export given product-specific trade resistance and geographically dispersed demand. Third, we construct an employment absorption index to identify industries with a high labour intensity. Our findings suggest a high export potential and scope for learning spillovers in complex sectors, such as machinery and chemicals. In contrast, less complex sectors, such as agro-processing, metal and wood, are correlated with higher employment creation. © 2022 The Authors.

Relying upon the Uppsala model as applied in light of a firm case study, we contribute to the validity of the Uppsala model 2017. We respond to the counterpoint by Coviello, Kano, and Liesch (2017) to the Uppsala 2017 model, answering the question, What is the impact of Industry 4.0 on the validity of the 2017 version of the Uppsala model? This study builds on a qualitative research methodology through a single case study of Delivery Hero, a global service provider firm. We adopt an extensive longitudinal approach to understand a startup firm's digital business concept and business evolution, including its internationalization paths. We conclude that the mechanisms of the Uppsala model are valid, but their characteristics have changed by digital and globalized value-adding processes. The dynamic capabilities possessed by the founding entrepreneur turn out to constitute a critical micro foundation for the firm's international business success. Our findings explain these change mechanisms, illustrating the stepwise progression process led by entrepreneurial decision-making. Industry 4.0 technologies have changed the very manner by which ﬁrms arrange their value-adding activities with their business stakeholders in course of the firm's internationalization.

With its notion of ventriloquism, the Montreal School has provided an interesting understanding of how organizations are constituted by the voices ascribed to them. Extant formulations of this perspective, however, fail to conceptualize how member voicing is informed and disciplined by social norms and expectations. Drawing on the notions of interpellation and role, we question how “organizational” organizational communication is and what is being constituted when members voice their organizations. By foregrounding the significance of social figures in this process, we call for an extension of the ventriloqual perspective beyond its current organization-centric perspective. © The Author(s) 2022.","interpellation; member voicing; social discipline; ventriloquism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125070121

We study these channels for increasing firms' value added in a stochastic frontier model.

In this paper, we demonstrate the relevance of necessary conditions in IB research and discuss how an adequate consideration of necessity logic can advance the field.

We offer a dual theory-policy research agenda focused on (a) designing empirical studies with policy-making goals in mind; (b) converting existing exploratory and explanatory research to prescriptive and normative research; (c) deriving policies frombodies of research rather than individual studies; and (d) creating policies based on integrating theories, fields, and levels of analysis.We hope our article will be a catalyst for the creation and implementation of research-based policies in OBHRM and other management subfields. © 2022 Academy of Management.

Our findings and managerial implications centre around the reputational effect on the firm and competitors, and upon the metaphor of ‘issue islands’. Proactive CPA strategies and constituency-building, whilst seen as risky, had a positive effect on firm CR amongst the industry stakeholders if adopted over the long-term. CPA strategies can also provide a first-mover competitive advantage; competitors that subsequently adopt the same strategy do not receive the same reputational benefits. ‘Issue islands’ was a metaphor used by one industry stakeholder to describe how the stakeholder-specific perception of one issue does not necessarily affect another; for example, the nutritional scientists focused on product nutrition and not a commercial organisation’s advertising when constructing the CR of that organisation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Competitive advantage; Corporate Political Activity; Corporate reputation; German food industry; Proactive political strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115244741

Based on a case study with eight cases, this paper aims to shed light on this crucial question. Our results revealed three basic patterns of ecosystem orchestration: single-, double-, and multi-orchestration ecosystems. These were determined by two key contingencies: production related knowledge and consumption related knowledge. This discovery yields several contributions to research and managerial practice. We show whether, and under which circumstances, orchestrators might include other ecosystem participants in the key tasks of orchestration. We demonstrate how orchestrators allocate these tasks to specific participants in the ecosystem. Furthermore, our results shed light on how orchestrators manage their ecosystem partners and secure their position within the ecosystem.

It has been shown by other researchers that most entrepreneurs who are successful started firms in their mid-40s, but what about those founders who are under the age of 35 and are running 42% of all new firms? How successful do they become, and what factors are consistent with their success? Using newly available data from Denmark on firm sales from 2001 to 2016, this paper shows that young founders who become serial entrepreneurs see their sales revenues nearly double between their first and second firms. Commensurate with this sales increase are two underlying factors: (1) young founders become more inclined to register new firms as limited liability corporations (LLCs), which protects them from personal losses if the firm fails; and (2), young founders who are the most successful are portfolio founders, or those who keep their first firms open when they found their second firm. Furthermore, for small firms, the productivity of the firm is often also the productivity of the founder, so just as the personal productivity of wage earners rises with age over their lifecycles, so too does the personal productivity and implied income of young entrepreneurs. © 2021","Entrepreneurship; Incorporation; Portfolio entrepreneurs; Serial entrepreneurs; Sole proprietorship; Young entrepreneurs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113175005

We develop an empirical model for educational correlations within the family in which parental educational sorting can translate into intergenerational transmission jointly by both parents, or transmission can originate from each parent independently. Estimating the model using educational attainment from Danish population-based administrative data for over 400,000 families, we find that on average 75 percent of the intergenerational correlation in education is driven by the joint contribution of the parents. We also document a 38 percent decline of assortative mating in education for parents born between the early 1920s and the early 1950s. While the raw correlations also show decreases in father- and mother-specific intergenerational transmissions of educational attainment, our model shows that once we decompose all factors of intergenerational mobility, the share of intergenerational transmission accounted for by parent-specific factors increased from 7 to 27 percent; an increase compensated by a corresponding fall in joint intergenerational transmission from both parents, leaving total intergenerational persistence unchanged.

Given these challenges, research is needed to understand if- and how-serendipitous innovations can be purposefully developed from BSRIs. In this study, we analyse ATTRACT, a novel initiative funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 program, which funded 170 projects with €100,000 each to develop a proof-of-concept commercial application of BSRI technologies within one year.

In a second step, we conducted multinomial logistic regressions using the project data, expert evaluations, and a questionnaire to identify the antecedents associated with the pursuit of each of the three modes. Our findings suggest that scientists and engineers develop many new ideas about novel potential applications of BSRI technologies in their daily work. The main value of ATTRACT is in facilitating project development through financial resources, brokering relationships with industrial partners, and facilitating the applications of technologies in domains outside of the immediate purview of BSRIs. © 2021","Big science; Deep tech; Innovation policy; Serendipity","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Logistic regression; Commercial applications; European Commission; Financial resources; Industrial partners; Multinomial logistic regression; Project development; Science infrastructure; Scientists and engineers; Engineering education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112462225

Surprisingly, there are no efforts to discuss why whistleblowing emerged as a distinct new action repertoire at this particular moment in time. Whistleblowing is a historical latecomer to an ethos of field transgression, which includes well-established forms of intervention such as watchdog journalism and political activism. Whistleblowing has strong affinities with these practices, but also holds its own unique place in ethics and democracy. We can only appreciate these qualities in full if we trace the historical origins of the concept. The article argues that the concept of whistleblowing crystallized at the intersection of a set of trends that picked up speed in the 1960s–1970s: individualization, changing perceptions of loyalty, declines in authority trust, new participation patterns, and a growing awareness of the dangers and complexities in human production and organization. This is not simply an exercise in disciplinary history. Whistleblowing is on the rise in these years, just as digitalization creates a whole new range of opportunities for disclosure. It takes an increasingly steady hand to isolate the distinct ethical-democratic contribution of whistleblowers within this complex reality. To achieve this, we need to be able to place whistleblowing on a broader sociological and historical map. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Conceptual history; Democracy and ethics; Whistleblowing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107866476

Contributing to the latter, we argue for further and deeper consideration of political parties, since: (1) parties illuminate organizational dynamics of in- and exclusion; (2) internal struggles related to the constitution of identities, practices and procedures are accentuated in parties; (3) the study of parties allow for the isolation of processes of normative and affective commitment; (4) parties prioritize and intensify normative control mechanisms; (5) party organizing currently represents an example of profound institutional change, as new (digital) formations challenge old bureaucratic models. Consequently, we argue that political parties should be seen as ‘critical cases’ of organizing, meaning that otherwise commonplace phenomena are intensified and exposed in parties. This allows researchers to use parties as magnifying glasses for zooming-in on organizational dynamics that may be suppressed or concealed by the seemingly non-political façade of many contemporary organizations. In conclusion, we argue that organization scholars are in a privileged position to investigate how political parties function today and how their democratic potential can be improved in the future. To this end, we call on Organization and Management Studies to engage actively with alternative parties in an attempt to explore and promote progressive change within the formal political system. © The Author(s) 2021.","alternative organization; commitment; democracy; inclusion and exclusion; intellectual activism; normative control; organizational politics; political parties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105720169

Regardless of initial optimistic forecasts for wearables’ market growth, there are few examples of successfully commercialized wearables, except those by technology giants like Apple. In contrast, start-ups developing wearables, while numerous, struggle to survive. The goal of this study is to explore how wearable technology is commercialized on a new market and what role consumers play in commercializing of these wearables. Previous studies on commercializing failures suggest that this is due to poor design of wearables, inappropriate business models, or an extended time lag needed for customers to accept such novel technology. In this article, we add to the ongoing discussion by approaching the commercializing process as an integrative practice that consists of materials, skills, and meanings. Drawing on three examples of wearable start-ups that correspond to a proto-practice, reproduced practice, and ex-practice, we analyze how the practice of wearables’ commercializing takes shape, perpetuates and falls apart, what problems accompany the practice, as well as how an understanding of commercializing can go beyond a traditional interpretation of profit increase. We argue that although mass consumption of wearables is yet to be seen, consumers contribute significantly to the formation of the practice of commercializing and integration of its elements, along with other elements and carriers of the practice. Therefore, our aim is to pinpoint the complexity and multiplicity of the commercialization process by outlining different participants in the market. © The Author(s) 2021.","commercializing; practice theory; start-ups; Wearable technologies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104652042

This is challenging, as host-country institutions not only relate to formal institutions, such as laws and regulations, but also to informal institutions, like traditions and beliefs. We study the hiring of employees with government work experience as a channel through which foreign MNC subsidiaries can better understand host-country institutions. Government work represents a context in which employees have opportunities to accumulate knowledge about how formal and informal institutions shape government procedures, and to develop political connections. Drawing from strategic human capital theory, we hypothesize that foreign MNC subsidiaries pay these employees salary premiums vis-à-vis domestic firms because they expect them to offer unique value. We find support for this hypothesis using data for 9,698 former government employees in Denmark. Salary premiums increase with government saliency in the industry and with seniority in the government. Our results shed light on how certain types of human capital can create value for foreign MNC subsidiaries and inform career choices of government officials.

However, there is a major gap in understanding the causal links between different uncertainty types and the project activities they trigger. Engineering managers lack guidance on how best to respond to different uncertainty types. We close this gap by experimentally contrasting responses to two uncertainty types central to NPD: technical and organizational uncertainty. We describe responses with respect to core engineering project activities: representation, information, and knowledge sharing. We present evidence from an experiment involving 50 professionals and 74 master's students. The results show that uncertainty type has a significant effect on activity response, and that there is a significant ordering effect within this response. Based on the identification of a new response type, change of situation, our findings show that technical uncertainty drives change of situation and representation activity, while organizational uncertainty drives information- and knowledge-sharing activities. This provides the basis for three main contributions of this article. First, we identify 'change of situation' as a new type of response to uncertainty in NPD. Second, we describe different responses to technical and organizational uncertainty. Third, we characterize an ordering effect in responses to uncertainty. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Activity selection; innovation; new product development; uncertainty","Knowledge management; Core engineering; Engineering managers; Knowledge-sharing; New product development; Ordering effects; Project activities; Project performance; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085147326

We call this mechanism 'uncertainty masking' and define it as the process through which a 'root uncertainty' is misidentified by the project team, resulting in the creation and management of a 'symptomatic uncertainty.' The root and symptomatic uncertainty types compound over time and hamper uncertainty resolution, leading to growth in the level of uncertainty during later project stages. We describe the impact of uncertainty masking on the u-shape level of uncertainty in the case project.

This study includes a systematic literature review to contextualize the impact of barriers from the perspective of 3R (i.e., reusing, remanufacturing, and recycling) recovery approaches. It classifies barriers into seven main groups in the context of CSC. The most often observed barriers hindering 3R recovery approaches are identified, and their impacts are discussed. The results demonstrate that barriers related to “economics and finance,” “governments and regulations,” and “society and culture” substantially impact the ability of organizations in the initial phase of adopting recovery approaches. In particular, key findings outline that consumer willingness to purchase recovered products impacts reuse, deficient supportive regulations impact 3R approaches (especially recycling), and a lack of support in the market impacts the ability of organizations to execute remanufacturing effectively. In addition, conducting empirical research is still desirable and creates a meaningful link between theory and practice. It helps to understand the barriers to remanufacturing, reusing, and recycling. © 2022 The Authors","Barriers; Circular economy; Recovery approaches; Systematic review","Recycling; Barrier; Circular economy; Contextualize; Initial phasis; Main group; Market impacts; Recovery approach; Reuse; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Supply chains",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130371875

As major entities, business organizations play a primal role in boosting the economy, stakeholders are increasingly under pressure to achieve net zero emissions. However, in emerging economies, these entities are scarcely inclined towards implementation of newer environmental policies as they're oblivious to perils of excessive carbon emissions and its consequences. Therefore, it is essential to look for sustainability measures to secure a system that reduces the carbon footprint and ultimately reaches a zero-carbon future. This research proposes a method to identify and assess the barriers of carbon regulatory policies (CRPs) so that advancements in carbon emission reduction practices can be pursued; we present a specific focus on developing nations. An integrated multi-criteria decision-making approach is proposed to achieve environmental sustainability. Initially, the Best Worst Method is used to determine the relative importance of the barriers in the implementation of regulatory policies.

High water retention capacity can improve human well-being in sandy areas. Several measures and cases have been already developed. To systematically find the differences between different ecosystem restoration models according to integrated benefits (e.g., ecological, economic and social benefits), this paper proposes an effective technical methodology to quantitatively identify sand control projects in a certain area. With the Southern edge of Tengger Desert-Shapotou in China as an example, this paper uses land use change and NDVI change rates to identify areas of wind and sand management. In addition, this paper uses actual evaporation (ET), soil moisture (SM), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and sand fixation service to compare the advantages and disadvantages of two typical sand management models in China according to their wind and sand control benefits, resource conservation, as well as socio-economic benefits. As indicated by the results, the straw checkboard engineering model has sustainable ecological and socio-economic benefits in water retention, cost consumption, as well as wind and sand control. Besides, the afforestation model achieves higher ecological benefits in the short term, whereas it has higher operating costs and poor sustainability, which makes this model difficult in maintaining ecological stability. On the whole, both types of sand control projects show their advantages and disadvantages in wind and sand control functions, resource recycling and socio-economic benefits. Furthermore, fast-growing afforestation combined with straw checkboards is capable of sustainably resisting wind and sand attacks and preventing land desertification. Accordingly, the finding of this paper can be referenced widely for wind and sand control. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological benefits; Growing afforestation; Sand fixation; Socio-economic benefits; Straw checkboard","Cost engineering; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Land use; Operating costs; Sand; Soil moisture; Storms; Control program; Ecological benefits; Ecological economics; Growing afforestation; Land desertification; Sand control; Sand fixation; Socio-economic benefits; Straw checkboard; Wind and sands; Reforestation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129486315

The built environment can be made circular by replacing building components with more circular ones. There are many circular design options for building components and knowledge about which options perform better – from an environmental perspective – is limited. Existing guidelines focussed on single components, single circular design options, applied different assessment methods and provide conflicting guidelines. Therefore, in this article, we develop environmental design guidelines by comparing multiple circular design options for two building components: a kitchen (short service life) and renovation façade (medium service life). First, we synthesize design variants based on distinct circular pathways, such as renewable-, non-virgin material use, and modularity for reuse. Second, we compare their environmental performance to a ‘business-as-usual’ variant through Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and a multi-cycle Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) including extensive sensitivity analysis on circular parameters. Analysing the 78 LCAs and MFAs, we derive 8 lessons learned on the environmental design of circular building components. We compare our findings to existing guidelines, including those for circular building structures (long service life). Amongst other lessons, we found components with a short service life benefit more from prioritizing circular design options to slow and close future cycles, whilst components with a longer service life benefit more from reducing resources and slowing loops on site. However, applying circular design options does not always result in a better environmental performance. Tipping-points were identified based on the number of use cycles, lifespans and the assessment methods applied. © 2022 The Authors","(CE); (LCA); (MFA); Building components; Circular economy; Design guidelines; Life cycle assessment; Material flow analysis; Multi-cycle","Architectural design; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Service life; (circular economy); (life cycle assessment); (material flow analyse); Circular designs; Circular economy; Design guideline; Materials flow analysis; Multi cycle; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129632574

The steadily growing population has led to an increased demand for aquaculture products, which in turns has intensified the farming of aquatic species along with aquafeed production. Fishmeal and soybean meal represent two of the most widely used protein sources in aquafeeds. Increasing demands and costs have fostered a need for supplementing fishmeal and soybean meal with sustainable alternatives in the coming years. Brewer's spent grain (BSG) is the major by-product generated in beer brewing. With a relatively high protein content, low market price and stable annual availability BSG represents a potential protein source for aquaculture feeds. However, in its untreated form BSG contains high levels of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) such as lignin and fibre which are known to reduce digestive performance in fish. Furthermore, BSG appears to be perishable under inappropriate storage conditions due to its high moisture content. Therefore, the main objective of this review was to compile an overview of different methods that may help facilitate the implementation of BSG in aquafeed. Before BSG may be utilised as a protein source, it must undergo refinement to remove lignocellulosic material. Here, we focus on two general approaches commonly used: a fractionation-and a conversion-based method. The fractionation-based approach relies on chemical extractions to separate BSG into its constituents, thereby removing the ANFs from the protein component. The conversion-based approach aims to transform ANFs into digestible substances by applying a combination of chemical, biological and enzymatic treatments. Application of appropriate preservation methods can help prevent microbial colonisation of BSG. Three different preservation methods were compared including freeze-drying, oven-drying and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) treatment. Of these, LAB treatment appears to be the most favourable with respect to energy-costs and potential health benefits. At present, BSG has not found any practical use in aquafeed production. However, the collection of methods presented in this review may provide a basis for incorporating BSG in aquafeeds and highlight possible future directions for realising this aim. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-nutritional factors; Aquaculture; Brewer's spent grain; Lignocellulose conversion; Protein extraction; Protein sources","Aquaculture; Beer; Drying; Lactic acid; Lignin; Antinutritional factors; Brewers spent grains; Fishmeal; Lactic acid bacteria; Lignocellulose conversions; Preservation methods; Protein extraction; Protein sources; Soybean meal; World-wide basis; Proteins; Conversion; Drying; Fractionation; Grain; Lactic Acid; Methods; Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129079896

Following the literature showing that there exists a correlation between gender and interest in topics distributed on the ¶EOPLE - ÞINGS spectrum, we check to what extent the promotional materials and course composition can be associated more with ¶EOPLE or rather with ÞINGS. Based on data from N=150 students who rated graphic and textual promotional materials and courses on the ¶EOPLE vs ÞINGS scale, we establish the following correlation: the programme with more women appear to be oriented significantly more towards ¶EOPLE (and less towards ÞINGS ) than the programme with less women.

At its core, computational thinking (CT) is seen as understanding how computational practices (such as, abstraction) and tools (such as modeling software) can be used to explore phenomena, solve problems, and influence our lives and society. The push for CT integration has called for preparing future educators to learn CT practices and tools through stand-alone courses and within the context of disciplinary pedagogy/methods courses. However, there are few instruments that measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards computational thinking and its role in formal schooling. In this study, we developed and validated an instrument to measure pre-service teachers' attitudes towards CT, its role in students' lives, and their own self-efficacy to incorporate CT into their teaching. We report results from a principal components factor analysis on survey responses from 260 pre-service teachers to identify patterns and reduce the number of dimensions of comparison in the analysis. We discuss how pre-service teacher conceptions have implications for preparing future teachers to integrate computational thinking into their instruction. © 2022 ACM.","computational thinking; pre-service teachers; teacher education","Education computing; Principal component analysis; Teaching; Computational thinkings; Computer Science Education; Engaging students; Learn+; Modeling softwares; Preservice teachers; Self efficacy; Stand -alone; Teacher education; Teachers conception; Students",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134431725

New flexibility in value-capture concepts like dynamic and value-based pricing is introduced, which was impossible before. This paper explores two things. Firstly, how embracing contractual flexibility of price-variance and contract lengths influences customer perceived value in artificial intelligence (AI) enabled digital offerings. Secondly, the role transparency plays in the perceived value of such offerings. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses an experiment-based survey and quantitative assessment within a business-to-business setup with 137 respondents across a couple of industrial manufacturers in the Nordic region. Findings: The authors observations indicate that value-capture-related flexibilities introduced by digital offerings, namely price fluctuations and longer contract lengths, are perceived to deliver more value to customers than standard offerings with known conditions. The authors findings indicate that introduced flexibilities are perceived as opportunities rather than uncertainties leading to higher perceived value by customers. The increased value perception can be explained by the transparency of these offerings provided by data-driven digital technologies'. Originality/value: The paper is an original work to understand the value-capture implication of digital servitization.

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Problem definition: Novel life-improving products, such as solar lanterns and energy-efficient cookstoves address essential needs of consumers in the base of the pyramid (BOP). However, their profitable distribution is often difficult because BOP customers are risk-averse, their ability to pay (ATP) is lower than their willingness to pay, and they face uncertainty regarding these products' value. Academic/practical relevance: We examine two practical strategies from distributors in the BOP: (1) improving the product's affordability through a discount and (2) increasing awareness of the product's value. Our results identify BOP-specific operational trade-offs in implementing these strategies. We also propose strategies to manage these trade-offs that can increase consumer surplus in the BOP. Methodology: We introduce a supply chain model for the BOP and analyze the distributor's pricing problem with refunds as well as the distributor's optimal budget allocation between strategies (1) and (2). Results: We find that, in the BOP, the distributor's profit-maximizing budget allocation often yields the lowest consumer surplus. This misalignment between profits and consumer surplus disappears if customers' ATP is high. Moreover, the misalignment can be resolved if the distributor offers free product returns and commits to a maximum retail price. We confirm the robustness of our results through numerical simulations. Managerial implications: Best operations strategy practices in the BOP can differ significantly from developed markets. Furthermore, BOP customers' limited ATP and high risk aversion generate a BOP-specific misalignment between profits and consumer surplus. Operational commitments, such as free returns, reduce this misalignment and can serve as a signal to investors of a social enterprise's focus on consumer surplus.

In this urgent search for a ‘new normal’, the embodied experience of hosting such an unwelcomed virus, the philosophical questions this raises, and the tourism futures already in the making, have not been fully explored. The article introduces Nancy's (2000/2002) philosophy, L'intrus [The Intruder], where he reflects on having a heart transplant operation to give body to the experiences of the self as exteriority and of otherness always already within. We take inspiration from Nancy to think and sense the experience of the COVID-19 virus intrusion in tourism. To do this, we weave personal philosophical reflections with ethnographic material to reflect on three themes of intrusion for tourism scholarship to consider: the experience of a body/self as exposed, the experience of a shattered self, and the experience of uncertain futures. © 2022 The Authors","COVID-19; Embodiment; Intrusion; Jean-Luc Nancy; Pandemic; Philosophizing tourism; Self; Tourism experience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136142990

While network research has typically treated relationships between social actors as static, there has been a surge in literature extending a dynamic lens to intraorganizational networks. Critically, there is no comprehensive and systematic review of intraorganizational network dynamics studies. Moreover, the field lacks programmatic coherence, clear and consistent terminology, and methodological clarity. This review attempts to resolve these issues. To foster a common lan-guage, we provide an integrative definition and clarify the scope of intraorganizational network dynamics. This allows us to distinguish four domains of dynamic network theo-rizing. Building on this, we develop an encompassing framework that maps the multiple facets of this literature and apply it to organize our summary and synthesis. We then take a bird’s-eye view of the full body of research and discuss four foundational areas in which network dynamics research can be conceptually and methodologically extended. We end by elaborating on the issue of interdependence in network data and providing an overview of leading statistical approaches for modeling longitudinal network data that explicitly account for dependence among observations. We see this review as an entry point for researchers interested in intraorganizational network dynamics and as a way to spark new scholarship on questions that remain open in this literature. © Academy of Management Annals.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135520957

We argue that these three perspectives should be brought into closer dia-logue and expanded, so we can overcome the decontextualized, reified, and atomized ways in which bureaucracy is often viewed. To that end, we offer three pathways to stimulate future research—exploring bureaucracy in its wider context, bureaucracy in action, and bureaucracy’s interdependencies and configurations.

This change of focus, which we advocate, has a potential to not only increase our understanding of how migrants' labour market integration is organized and practiced at the organizational level, but also shed light on migrants' own mobilizations and agency in these processes. Research on organizational practices of workplace integration of migrants is also relevant as economic and political migration is still high on the agenda in many European countries, particularly since the so-called ‘refugee crisis’ in 2015, when hundreds of thousands of refugees made their way to Europe. Unfortunately, the war in Ukraine in 2022 reminds us of the heightened importance of this issue. In this article, we start by outlining what has motivated this Special Section.

Recently, the coronavirus has brought some problems for supply chain networks. Remarkably, perishable product supply chain networks, such as pharmaceutical, dairy, blood, and food supply chains deal with more sophisticated situations. Generally, during pandemic outbreaks, the activities of these industries can play an influential role in society. On the one hand, products of these industries are considered to be daily necessities for living. However, on the other hand, there are many new restrictions to control the coronavirus prevalence, such as closing down all official gatherings and lessening the work hours, which subsequently affect the economic growth and gross domestic product. Therefore, risk assessment can be a useful tool to forestall side-effects of the coronavirus outbreaks on supply chain networks. To that aim, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach is used to evaluate the risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the coronavirus outbreak era. Feedback from academics was received to identify the most important risks. Then, experts in pharmaceutical, food, and dairy industries were inquired to specify the interrelations among risks. Then, Pythagorean fuzzy sets are employed in order to take the uncertainty of the experts’ judgments into account. Finally, analyses demonstrated that the perishability of products, unhealthy working conditions, supply-side risks, and work-hours are highly influential risks that can easily affect other risk factors. Plus, it turned out that competitive risks are the most susceptive risk in the effect category. In other words, competition among perishable product supply chain networks has become even more fierce during the coronavirus outbreak era. The practical outcomes of this study provide a wide range of insights for managers and decision-makers in order to prevent risks to perishable product supply chain networks during the coronavirus outbreak era. © 2022","COVID-19; Disaster management; Pandemic outbreaks; Perishable product supply chains; Pythagorean fuzzy DEMATEL; Risk analysis","COVID-19; disaster management; disease spread; Granger causality test; health risk; pandemic; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131064408

Based on cross-sectional representative survey data among managers and shop stewards in Denmark, this paper offers a fresh perspective on the recent decentralisation process. We explore if company-based bargaining structures are in place and whether local social partners have utilised these bargaining opportunities across distinct sectors after decades of decentralisation. Analytically, we seek inspiration from Visser's (2016) distinct forms of organised decentralisation and combine these with insights from the broader literature on IR and institutional change.

Yet, we know little about how the fidelity of a prototype—the degree to which it approximates the final product—can affect funding decisions. We study the relationship between prototype fidelity and resource acquisition of nascent technology ventures in online crowdfunding. Based on the community logic under which crowdfunding operates and the diverse motivations of funders to participate, we develop the seemingly counterintuitive idea that moderate prototype fidelity is more effective in gaining support from funders than high prototype fidelity. Across our three empirical studies, we find support for the hypothesis that prototype fidelity has an inverted U-shaped relationship with crowdfunding performance. This relationship is moderated by the materiality of the offered rewards and the quality of the prototype presentation delivered through the online interface. © 2022 The Authors","Crowdfunding; Institutional logics; Prototype fidelity; Resource acquisition; Technology ventures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129986846

As an alternative, companies are increasingly requesting internal audits to deliver this support. Even though internal audit function (IAF) are an important player in internal control, however, there is little academic knowledge about their impact. Based on a single-case study in a large financial institution, this paper explores to what extent and how IAF affect internal controls. Furthermore, it assesses whether IAF add value to the company.

However, the formation of this intention might be influenced by the fear of missing out (FOMO), making decision-makers fear losing their relatedness with fellow managers and leading to decisions based on irrational considerations. We draw on and extend the technology acceptance model to explain the potential bias caused by FOMO and expect that this bias is contingent on the level of decision makers' prior experience with the new technology in other contexts. Moderated OLS regressions on 514 observations collected from a representative sample of decision-makers of Austrian SMEs show that FOMO is positively related to the intention to adopt new technology. Moreover, we find that the relationship is mitigated by the decision maker's prior experience with that new technology. We highlight the relevance of the FOMO bias in technology acceptance, adding to the growing research stream on the role of emotions in adopting novel technologies. We further show how experience can effectively counter the FOMO bias for many decision-makers and extend the scope of technology acceptance models by illustrating their applicability to novel manufacturing technologies. © 2022","additive manufacturing; experience; fear of missing out; small and medium-sized, businesses; technology acceptance","3D printers; Behavioral research; Corporates; Decision makers; Ease-of-use; Experience; Fear of missing out; Manufacturing technologies; Prior experience; Small and medium sized business; Technology acceptance; Technology acceptance model; Decision making; business; decision making; manufacturing; perception; small and medium-sized enterprise; technology adoption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129311806

In this paper, we investigate and compare the development of local electricity exchange practices in three European countries: France, Switzerland, and Great Britain. We ask: how do local electricity exchange practices and markets vary across national contexts? What are their dynamics of ownership and consolidation, if any? What areas of contestation or disagreement emerge? To answer these questions, we first briefly define and conceptualize local electricity exchange and its categories before explicating our mixed methods research design consisting of document analysis, 40 original expert interviews across the three countries, and observational data derived from seven meetings and events. These comparative cases reveal the complexity and variation of the local electricity exchange phenomenon across our three national contexts, how such acts of decentralization in turn (and perhaps unpredictably) consolidate power among incumbent actors, and how local electricity exchanges are prone to significant contestation and disagreement. Moreover, they reveal competing dynamics of centralization and shifting forms of ownership. We conclude by noting that (i) local electricity exchange has as much potential to cement conventional actors and power relations in the sector as it does to support new actors or transform power relations; (ii) approaches to local electricity exchange vary considerably across national contexts and are strongly linked with institutional frameworks and policy regimes; and (iii) the future merits of local electricity exchange are prone to great uncertainty and contestation. © 2022 The Author(s)","Collective self-consumption; Community energy; Energy democracy; Local electricity exchange; Peer-to-peer electricity trading","Collective self-consumption; Community energy; Electricity exchanges; Electricity trading; Energy; Energy democracy; Local electricity exchange; Peer to peer; Peer-to-peer electricity trading; Switzerland; Power markets; cement (construction material); electricity supply; energy policy; energy use; institutional framework; power relations; research work; France; Switzerland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129307063

Despite their positive impacts on ETO companies' operations and strategies, there is a paucity of empirical investigations examining the development processes and practices of configurators, in particular integrated configurators. We, thus, carry out a longitudinal case study in a large ETO company to study and compare the characteristics and dynamics of the development process of an integrated sales and technical (ST) configurator with these of a sales configurator and a technical configurator. First, the findings uncover the nature of the integrated ST configurator development process in terms of development team formation, development planning activities, processes and activities that went wrong, and unplanned events and their handling. Second, performance evaluation with respect to several criteria contributes to a holistic picture of the development process of the integrated ST configurator. Based on the findings, we further shed light on managerial implications including the business process changes associated with the application of the integrated ST configurator and the need of having a clear, comprehensive project plan before development. To conclude, our study is expected to broaden ETO companies’ understanding of the development processes of integrated configurators and to guide them to make wise decisions in developing configurators. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Configurator development; Engineering-to-order; Integrated configurators; Longitudinal case study; Project planning","Business Process; Company's strategy; Configurator; Configurator development; Development process; Engineering-to-order; Integrated configurator; Longitudinal case study; Project planning; Project management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129066304

The differences manifested themselves in the form of different views concerning material well-being, house ownership, freedom, teamwork, and the general approach to working life (being a co-owner and being an employee). At the same time, we found that issues like job security, temporary contracts, part-time work, and gig working needed to be seen more in-depth instead of assuming their generic negative influence on well-being and work meaningfulness.

Unleashing that potential requires the simple rules to be accountable. However, identifying and addressing the bottleneck necessitates choosing the right evidence base, and choosing the evidence base is only possible when the bottlenecks are known beforehand. Due to this challenge, managers face a dilemma in developing simple rules. We suggest a novel approach to address this dilemma that integrates the principles of simple rules and data-driven mathematical optimization, and demonstrate its feasibility in the highly complex and dynamic context of green energy.

The empirical strategy builds on matching techniques and estimations of earnings equations in a difference-in-differences framework with heterogenous treatment years. We provide evidence that there exists an earnings penalty when highly educated entrepreneurs return to wage employment. This effect is persistent throughout the time period that we observe. For individuals with lower educational attainment, we find no or weak evidence of a wage penalty. Our results suggest that the wage penalty for highly educated individuals operates through the depreciation of specific specialized skills valuable in wage employment. © 2022, The Author(s).","Earnings; Education; Entrepreneurship exit; Labor Mobility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128708727

Through a two-year ethnographic study of remote craft villages in Vietnam, we consider how political concerns are mobilized, distributed and materialized through craft. Defining craft as a process of organizing that often involves mundane objects, but also sits at the centre of political concerns, we are interested in understanding how craft as tekhnē is realized in organizations and suggest two key features: craft as a location for politics and as a basis for mobilizing politics of scale. We provide three main contributions. First, we show that tekhnē can hold steady a focus on organizing through mundane objects. Second, we demonstrate that attending to the mundane reveals distinct relationships between technology and forms of organizing, that mobilize political concerns. Third, we explore the ways mundane objects of tekhnē are not only involved in representing and preserving cultural heritage, but also in challenging the marginalized status of these communities. © The Author(s) 2022.","craft; ethnography; objects; politics; scale; science and technology studies; technology; tekhnē",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128309946

We label this approach ‘hard city sensing’ (HCS) and we argue that the rise of the ‘digital city’ offers the empirical foundation for more humanistic approaches. Driven by the ambition to untangle data-driven urbanism from HCS, this paper reviews two decades of scholarship that has used digital traces as an empirical ground for understanding urban phenomena. The review identifies four distinct ways of working with digital traces of which three pave the way for new ways of problematizing the city. Instead of abandoning the idea of data-driven urbanism, we propose the framework of 'soft city sensing' (SCS) as way to re-engage with it with inspiration from these pioneering works. However, this requires a willingness to revisit central epistemological commitments that currently serve as standards for how to “properly” do data projects. We therefore urge qualitative urban scholars to ponder the possibilities of furthering their urban interest by ‘thinking with algorithms’ while retaining their interpretative ambitions just as we identify a need for urban decion-makers to expand their criteria for what serves as valid data inputs to urban planning. © 2022 The Authors","Big data; Computational humanities; Digital city; Social web; Soft City Sensing; Urban studies","smart city; urban area; urban development; urban planning; urban population; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127508492

To lay the ground for the study, it redefines the concept of discursive power as the capacity of trade unions to influence the public debate by producing and self-mediating frames and circulating them through the mainstream media, the Internet and social media to a mass audience. Data were collected over 3 years (2013–2015) using interviews and scraping tweets from Twitter. The findings reveal how the People's Assembly created and sustained a heterogenous coalition through a policy of nonpartisanship and a consensus-driven decentralised network of grassroots local assemblies orchestrated by a national organisation.

Afterward, we argue that botnet tracking qualifies as ”processing of personal data” and falls under the material scope of the GDPR. We then present three scenarios where these botnet tracking techniques apply: botnet tracking research in the public interest, botnet tracking in the commercial interest and botnet tracking conducted by Internet service providers. For each scenario, we discuss the differing goals, identify the appropriate legal bases, and elaborate on the practical implications.

The benchmarking results are used to set an individual revenue cap for each company. The benchmarking model is currently criticised for not including the companies’ supply quality and thereby having an omitted variable bias problem. One problem the regulator has encountered when trying to incorporate supply quality in the benchmarking model is that it tends to increase the revenue caps more than desired. The regulator does, however, not have any prior information about the marginal rates of substitution between the quality variables and costs, which makes it challenging to reduce the supply quality's impact on the revenue caps. In this paper, we analyse the facet structure when incorporating three quality variables into the existing benchmarking model. We argue that it is generally sensible to investigate the facet structure and ensure that it is trustworthy before calculating efficiency scores, to increase the credibility of the results. By using an outlier detection model on the estimated marginal rates of substitution, we use the insights into the facet structure to create weight restrictions between costs and quality. This can help the regulator incorporate quality in the model without allowing the efficiency scores to increase excessively due to the increase in dimensionality. In addition, our proposed method reduces the need to extract the companies’ private information about their marginal rates of substitution, which is costly to verify for both the companies and the regulator. Lastly, we propose to add weight restrictions based on the consumer's willingness to pay for quality to avoid the companies choosing a level of quality that is higher than what the consumers are willing to pay for. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Data envelopment analysis; Facet structure; Marginal rates of substitution; Regulation; Weight restrictions","article; benchmarking; consumer; human; outlier detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125278351

Accordingly, the past decade has seen an increasing attention among scholars to fields such as innovation, organizational performance, and creativity. Nevertheless, studies in organizational creativity, i.e., the management of creativity at an organizational level, are still fragmented and have not converged into a single comprehensive conceptual model. The purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the literature on organizational creativity in order to map the different perspectives on the subject and provide direction for future research. The paper thoroughly explores the literature through bibliographic research on papers published between 1980 and 2020. The literature is mapped, categorized, and analyzed to identify the different models of organizational creativity, i.e., concepts, definitions, and theories. The paper identifies seven models and shows that field could converge by connecting two tracks of the literature: the track of the dynamic componential model with the track of the personal and contextual factors. Furthermore, the paper uses this insight to propose practical guidelines for managing creativity by mapping contextual factors at the individual, team, and organizational levels that can be used with the dynamic componential model. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Bibliometric study; Creativity; Organization; Organizational creativity","Bibliometric; Bibliometric study; Concept definitions; Conceptual model; Contextual factors; Creativity; Organisational; Organizational creativity; Organizational levels; Organizational performance; Information management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124618096

Strategists' assumptions about how an envisioned future can be reached are likely incomplete and possibly wrong, for instance, if critical contingencies have been overlooked. We explain how strategists can learn from thinking about and testing necessary conditions for an envisioned future to materialize. By logically linking assumptions to consequences our framework allows drawing inferences from experiments with testable assumptions about elements of a strategy that cannot be tested without major investments. Our framework contains the first formal model of learning from arguments in the strategy literature. By using our framework, strategists can maintain focus on an envisioned future while at the same time systematically seeking out reasons and evidence for why they are wrong. Managerial Summary: We develop a framework that helps strategists to learn and understand what it takes to reach ambitious goals when there is substantial uncertainty. We ask strategists to formulate their assumptions as a theory: what needs to be true for their goal to materialize. Our framework enables strategists to scrutinize and improve their assumptions by raising objections against their theory and by pointing them to critical experiments to learn whether their assumptions hold. Using our results, strategists can in particular identify overlooked critical contingencies. Overall, we suggest how strategists should revise their beliefs about what it takes to be successful in the light of evidence and arguments for and against their strategy. © 2022 The Authors.

In this article, we argue that a specific form of human capital specific to interactions with public programs—administrative literacy—affects the psychological costs recipients are facing. Specifically, we propose that administrative literacy is positively associated with autonomy maintenance in the face of burdensome rules, and that autonomy maintenance is negatively associated with stress. In doing so, we investigate a theoretically founded differentiation of psychological costs. We test these propositions using structural equation modeling on a unique survey of 915 unemployment insurance recipients in Denmark.

The uncertainty that surrounds the future is both exciting and challenging, with individuals and organisations seeking to minimise risks and maximise utilities. The large number of forecasting applications calls for a diverse set of forecasting methods to tackle real-life challenges. This article provides a non-systematic review of the theory and the practice of forecasting. We provide an overview of a wide range of theoretical, state-of-the-art models, methods, principles, and approaches to prepare, produce, organise, and evaluate forecasts. We then demonstrate how such theoretical concepts are applied in a variety of real-life contexts. We do not claim that this review is an exhaustive list of methods and applications. However, we wish that our encyclopedic presentation will offer a point of reference for the rich work that has been undertaken over the last decades, with some key insights for the future of forecasting theory and practice. Given its encyclopedic nature, the intended mode of reading is non-linear. We offer cross-references to allow the readers to navigate through the various topics. We complement the theoretical concepts and applications covered by large lists of free or open-source software implementations and publicly-available databases. © 2021 The Author(s)","Applications; Encyclopedia; Methods; Prediction; Principles; Review; Time series",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123082516

In an ecological sense, they enable the rapid extension of tolerance limits by digitally scaling variables such as the availability of accommodation or labour. However, such maximization of specific variables in a complex ecology bears the danger of pathological runaway patterns. In our paper we draw on the work of Gregory Bateson to outline an analytical approach for the study of digital platforms as ecological phenomena, focusing on the effects of digitalization on the context in which platforms operate. To study such meta-patterns, we elaborate three interrelated concepts: stress, adaptation and budgets of flexibility. We exemplify these ideas through a longitudinal study of the early digital platform Couchsurfing and develop implications for our understanding of technology and organization. © The Author(s) 2021.","Bateson; Couchsurfing; digital platform; ecology; ecosystem; sustainability; technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122301002

Yet, commentators debate whether U.S. corporations have indeed moved toward a stakeholder orientation, given the difficulties in measuring such a shift. We assess this shift by examining corporate governance practices, especially the prevalence of shareholder- and stakeholder-oriented practices in chief executive officer (CEO) dismissals. Using data on large firms in 1980–2015, we found that, before the 2000s, CEOs were less heavily penalized for poor firm performance when they demonstrated a shareholder orientation by downsizing and refocusing the corporation and more heavily penalized for CSR activity. This trend, however, reversed after the early 2000s. This article provides evidence of the evolution of U.S. firms' governance practices from a shareholder toward stakeholder orientation. Managerial Summary: Many people are skeptical of the assertion that U.S. corporations have become more stakeholder-oriented over time. It is no wonder, as scant evidence exists for this claim. We tackle this claim head on by analyzing firm practices in 1980–2015 that contributed to chief executive officer (CEO) dismissal when the firm was performing poorly. Some practices, such as downsizing and firm refocusing, are associated with a shareholder orientation and others, such as CSR, are associated with a stakeholder orientation. We found strong evidence for a growing trend toward a stakeholder orientation. When the firm was performing poorly before the 2000s, CEOs were more likely to be dismissed for CSR activities and less likely to be dismissed for downsizing or refocusing the firm. This trend reversed in the early 2000s. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","CEO dismissal; corporate social responsibility; institutional theory; shareholder primacy; survival analysis","Chief executive officer; Corporate governance; Corporate social responsibility; Firm Performance; Stakeholder orientations; Shareholders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122075749

However, there is limited empirical evidence of how using freemium strategies impacts firm revenues. We empirically investigate how the strengthening of network effects on the Apple App Store influenced product sales of firms using freemium strategies, contrasting the impacts on both market leaders and followers. We find that stronger network effects did not on their own lead to greater revenues for market leaders with respect to followers. However, in settings where freemium strategies were used, network effects greatly amplified the advantage of leaders over followers. Managerial Summary: Freemium strategies are increasingly common as a way for firms to increase the number of users and benefit from network effects. However, there has not been much empirical investigation in this regard, particularly in cases where products using freemium strategies face competition. In this article, we investigate how a policy by Apple on the App Store that led to stronger network effects, impacted the performance of market leaders and followers depending on whether they used freemium or not. We find that it led to an increase in revenues of leaders over followers (effectively, market dominance) but only when freemium strategies were used. The analysis demonstrates an interplay the between business model and network effects. In addition, it shows how stronger network effects and freemium strategies only benefitted market leaders in our setting. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","business models; digital competition; freemium; market dominance; network effects","Commerce; Fruits; App stores; Business models; Digital competition; Empirical investigation; Freemium; Market dominance; Market leader; Network effects; Product sales; Product strategy; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121642554

As the greedy, neoliberal university penetrates our homes and bodies during lockdown, it infuses our (work) lives with a magnitude of mixed pressures and troublesome effects and affects. Embedded in very different home situations, we explore autoethnographically how we are affected similarly and differently, through questioning our senses of toxic productivity, toxic passivity and toxic affectivity. We recast toxicity as – not a characteristic of the university but – a fundamentally relational issue which works through and exacerbates individualization and isolation in the context of the pandemic, thus requiring relational forms of feminist resistance in response. For this purpose, we develop an approach for writing our differences together, which cares for and fleshes out our lived, multifaceted experiences including the filth and shame associated with the toxic new normal. In doing so, we are not escaping toxicity, but reconfiguring our embodiments and enactments of it by caring for ourselves and others, which re-energizes us to push back and unsettle how we may live academia, and perhaps become happy academics, during this crisis and beyond. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","ethic of care; feminist resistance; neoliberal university; toxicity; writing differently","ethics; ethnography; health care; university sector",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120458286

However, little knowledge exists on users' relationships with smartphones. This study examines the user-smartphone relationship from an attachment perspective. More specifically, the present research develops an understanding of the different faces of smartphone attachment considering the perceived value-in-use of smartphones as a source. The findings of an online survey among smartphone users reveal that users are attached to the smartphone itself because of the value it derives during usage. Most interestingly, the effects of perceived value-in-use have been found to be ambivalent because they can enhance both positive (e.g., passion) and negative (e.g., separation distress) aspects of smartphone attachment. Moreover, specific compositions of the value-in-use define the individual facets of smartphone attachment. For instance, passion has been found to be determined by social, hedonic, and utilitarian value-in-use, whereas distress is triggered by both perceived utilitarian and hedonic value-in-use.

Much literature attends to the ordering and controlling organizational powers of digital data infrastructures. We propose to expand existing discussions by also exploring their disorganizing aspects. Drawing on Marilyn Strathern, we conceptualize digital data infrastructures as partial connections that both connect and disconnect, with the implication of simultaneously ordering and disordering the social relations implicated by digital data infrastructures. With a case study of a national well-being survey used in Danish education governance, we illustrate this point, showing how connective and commensurable powers of digital infrastructures not only (re-)organize social relations through their datafication but also disorganize the infrastructural imperative of connectivity in unanticipated ways. This leads us to argue that dis/organization is integral to the powerful ordering capacities of digital data infrastructures. © The Author(s) 2021.","datafication; digitalization; dis/organization; governing by numbers; infrastructure; partial connections; technology – information systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118493197

On one hand, organizational learning is a means to further organizational performance, a fixed goal to be measured, which sometimes demands unlearning. On the other hand, there is a call for organizational learning to be encompassing contemporary societal challenges like widespread digitalization, sustainable production, and an inclusive labor market. This may appear as a cleavage between immediate relevance to practitioners and researchers’ responsibilities for the development of relevant and critical knowledge.

Prestige enhancement is a common tourist motivation, yet, as tourists have been portrayed as irresponsible and even dangerous during the pandemic, the benefits of travel for personal prestige may have been affected. The purpose of this study is to monitor changes in tourists’ personal prestige during the early pandemic in 2020. Design/methodology/approach: The authors developed an innovative study design implicitly measuring the personal prestige of tourists shown on experimentally manipulated social media posts. Three measurement waves were issued to compare the personal prestige of tourists just before, during and after the first lockdown situation in Germany. Findings: Differences regarding evaluations of tourists’ prestige were found for prestige dimensions of hedonism, achievements, wealth and power, suggesting that prestige ascription to tourists has been affected by the changing discourse on leisure travel.

Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study of a qualitative nature was conducted using a self-administered open-ended questionnaire among tourists who had stayed in an Airbnb in the past three years. Data were collected using two different sources for triangulation purposes, referred to as Studies 1 and 2. Findings: Many respondents reported conducting similar activities while at home and while staying in an Airbnb, supporting Burch’s (1969) spill-over theory. Travellers mostly recalled mundane activities, such as cooking. The results suggest that the spill-over effect is more prevalent in the Airbnb context than in other accommodation types, as one often travels from one’s own home to another’s home. Respondents associated their Airbnb experience with the positive emotion of joy. Respondents mentioned numerous reasons for having felt joy during their Airbnb experiences, such as sharing the trip with travel companions and spending time with friends. Practical implications: Airbnb should clearly define host’s tasks and responsibilities, hosts should treat guests in a friendly manner, which includes resolving any problems they face in relation to the rental property. Originality/value: This paper proposes a new conceptual framework for a memorable Airbnb experience, which comprises several components: socialising and bonding with friends and family members, location, the host’s hospitality, a homely feeling, home amenities and negative experiences (the poor condition of the room and a dishonest host). © 2021, Erose Sthapit, Peter Björk Dafnis N.

We extend the neo-institutional theory of management fashions to define leadership fashions as a process that constantly reconfigures the rational norms and expectations attached to leadership, and that elevates certain approaches as the best way to fulfill those norms and expectations. Combining Weber’s broad understanding of rationality with our own concept of affective rationality, we account for the many different instrumental, practical, moral, and sometimes deeply personal and emotional norms and expectations that drive the leadership fashion setting process. This approach contributes a theoretical foundation for understanding the sociological significance of leadership fashions, for exploring the leadership industries that produce and promote them, and for researching further the ways that leadership fashions and the leadership industries influence leadership research, learning, and practice. © The Author(s) 2021.","Critical leadership studies; leadership; leadership development; management fashions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104897755

In other words the interest is on what happens when the critical practice of whistleblowing or ‘speaking truth to power’ is sought institutionalized and transformed into a practice of ‘speaking truth through power’ – that is, through the managerial instrument of the whistleblowing hotline. The article argues that the Foucauldian concept of dispositive can help explain how a seemingly expedient and pragmatic technique such as the whistleblowing hotline, is in fact riddled with complexity and contradiction, which in turn creates a series of dilemmas and limitations related to aim and function the hotline. The analysis thus shows how the internal whistleblowing hotline can take different forms depending on the dispositive permeating it.

Literature adopting a relational view, however, has offered a way out of this opposition, by embracing the multiplicity of beings that may make up organizations. We extend this approach by engaging with French philosopher Étienne Souriau’s discussion of modes of existence to suggest that organizations are “synaptic,” which means they exist in the passages between modes, as they articulate the actions of entities existing under different modalities. By analyzing the case of a hospital merger in Denmark, we show that this work of articulation amounts to organizing, and that viewing organizations as synaptic recognizes not only their ontic pluralism, but also their existential pluralism.

While previous work has focused on decision rules based on adaptive expectations, the present work expands this analysis by explicitly incorporating customers’ attitude toward risk to study the impact of risk aversion on the collective behavior and the average system sojourn time. The customers’ decision process is modeled using adaptive expectations and incorporating the uncertainty involved in these expectations. Customers update their expectations based on their own experience and that of their neighbors. Simulation analysis is used to compare the aggregated behavior for different degrees of customer risk aversion. Risk-neutral customers base their decisions only on their expected sojourn time, while risk-averse customers account for uncertainty by estimating an upper bound of the sojourn times. The results indicate that the more risk-averse the customers, the longer the transient period, and the more slowly the system converges to an almost stable average sojourn time.

The objective of this study was, therefore, to examine line managers' use of violence preventive practices in high-risk sectors. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed three different sources of data (semi-structured interviews and field notes from both leadership seminars and coaching sessions) that were collected in the context of an intervention study in Denmark aimed at improving violence prevention. The authors conducted a thematic analysis of violence prevention experiences among 16 line managers – eight from the prison and probation services and eight from psychiatric hospitals. Findings: Using an existing prevention framework, the authors categorized the descriptions into three types of violence preventive practices used by the line managers across the two sectors: “preventing violence”, “managing episodes of violence” and “promoting the positive”. Especially the category “promoting the positive” is often neglected in the intervention literature. Originality/value: The study identified new aspects of managers' violence preventive practices than those included in the violence prevention climate concept. Such knowledge may help organizations devise improved systems for violence prevention in high-risk sectors. © 2021, Sofie Østergaard Jaspers, Dorte Raaby Andersen, Iben Louise Karlsen, Lars Peter Sønderbo Andersen, Paul Maurice Conway, Johnny Dyreborg and Birgit Aust.","Management; Managers' work environment; Prison and probations services; Psychiatry; Violence prevention; Violence prevention climate; Workplace violence","article; correctional facility; Denmark; human; intervention study; leadership; manager; mental hospital; organization; probation; psychiatry; semi structured interview; thematic analysis; violence; work environment; workplace violence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129198266

To offer a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships, the moderating role of technological reflectiveness and business moral values is also accounted for. Design/methodology/approach: A scenario-based experimental study to test the impact of corporate support programs on environmental and social innovation behaviors is also adopted. After running a pretest to verify the effectiveness of alternative scenarios through 100 respondents with managerial experience residing in the UK and EU countries, we collected data from a sample of 220 senior managers of firms from the Australian food and beverage industry for the main study. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's test to investigate direct relationships and the PROCESS Model to test the moderating role of technological reflectiveness and business moral values were used. Findings: The findings reveal time provision, budget provision and advice provision as salient forms of corporate support programs that positively impact managers' environmental and social innovation behaviors. It is found that technological reflectiveness positively moderates the link between time provision and managers' social innovation behavior and negatively moderates the link between advice provision and managers' social innovation behavior. Furthermore, it is found that business moral values positively moderate the relationships between time and budget provisions and managers' environmental innovation behavior and between budget and advice provisions and managers' social innovation behavior.

Some chemical substances are controlled by international or European guidelines and policies, which are continuously updated to control new substances or apply different threshold limits in newly marketed electronic equipment. Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that e-plastics still contain several problematic compounds, which are not yet restricted. Additionally, the continuously increasing number of regulations on products and waste recycling, and the ambiguous regulations on additives, created a challenging situation for e-plastics recycling. This paper is a literature review of commercial additives in e-plastics, which presents an inventory of 145 hazardous and high-concern additives, with cross-reference to their types, polymer of application and the relevant regulations and policies. The study also offers a comprehensive overview of the existing measures, legislations and activities related to e-plastics recycling, with the aim of understanding future trends, gaps, and limitations of the European regulatory framework. Additionally, the review highlighted additives which can be new candidates for restriction, by analyzing their hazardous effects. The outcomes confirm that phthalate plasticizers, and pigments are well regulated, yet, most additives and mainly organic flame retardants are still candidates for future restrictions or are not yet considered.

This is most relevant in emerging economies such as India, as the sustainable growth of the food supply chain (SC) is predominantly dependent upon its multiple tiers of suppliers. Regrettably, the most impactful tier of suppliers, which are the grass-root suppliers, lie outside the reach of the sustainable efforts of the FMC. Significantly, the incorporation of the sustainability initiatives needs consistent and coordinated efforts of all the tiers of suppliers and stakeholders, especially in the current situation where a global pandemic badly hits farmers. This can be achieved by adopting Collaborative Sustainable Practices (CSPs) for channelization of joint efforts of FMC and stakeholders towards sustainability of grass-root suppliers using supply chain practice view. However, minimal documentation exists regarding the same, and the present study intends to fill this gap. Based on a case study of an Indian flour milling company, the focus of the research work is (1) identifying CSPs that FMC can adopt, (2) ascertaining the role of interim suppliers for ensuring sustainability up to the last tier of suppliers, and (3) developing a structural model utilizing combined efficiencies of Total Interpretive Structural Modeling technique and Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis, which the FMC can adopt for effectively implementing both the traditional practices as well as the CSPs. Through the result findings, decision-makers can visualize the impact and strength of each CSP and its interactions with other CSPs. It can enable them to cascade effective managerial responses into the respective tiers of SC for successful implementation of the CSPs and transmission of sustainability benefits to include the grass root suppliers. The study provides significant theoretical implications contributing to the existing literature on sustainability in a multi-tier food SC. Further, inputs to policy formulators for enhancing sustainability of farmers are outlined. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Collaborative sustainable practices; Food supply chain; Integrated TISM-Fuzzy MICMAC Model; Lower tier suppliers; Supply chain practice view","Agriculture; Decision making; Food supply; Supply chains; Collaborative sustainable practice; Food manufacturing; Food supply chain; Grass roots; Integrated TISM-fuzzy MICMAC model; Low tier supplier; Manufacturing companies; Supply chain practice view; Supply chain practices; Sustainable practices; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128228125

Although this is the case in Lebanon, Lebanese political activists and youth movements advocate for secularism as the only alternative to the present consociational political system. The article introduces the worldview theory of the German philosopher Karl Jaspers and deconstructs the concept of secularism by focusing on philosophical and anthropological academic debates on the topic. The goal is to discover why Lebanese support of secular movements and parties is remarkably limited despite the massive support of civil society for a radical critique of the present political system. The article ends with a discussion of two concepts: “radical secularism,” coined by the philosopher Charles Taylor; and “asecular power,” introduced by the anthropologist Hussein al Agrama. It concludes that the Lebanese case teaches us that the relation been worldviews and secularism must be reformulated in new ways to solve the secularism dilemma. © 2022 The Author.

The pandemic of the last two years has accelerated the growth and importance of digital media and sales channels – another typically siloed team – in how customers research, consider and buy. Change is not only taking place in more obvious consumer markets, but also in B2B, where both customers and suppliers have been forced to move more of sales and service processes online. This is delivering surprisingly positive outcomes in many cases, with McKinsey’s research showing that buyers and sellers alike prefer the new digital reality.2 As the need to connect ‘base nurturing’ activities (which tend to be owned by sales departments) and ‘growth activities’ (usually led by marketers) becomes clearer and as the digitalisation of both sale and marketing becomes more mainstream, we are seeing the re-birth of the ownership of ‘line of sight to results’ across functional silos. This is happening with the creation of roles such as Chief Growth Officer, Chief Customer Officer and new-style CMOs or CSOs who take a data-first approach and tend to look further than their own discipline along the entire value chain for the customer. This hybrid position bridges traditional departmental silos such as business development, sales, marketing, operations, customer support and information technology. While those organisations are striving to understand their customers’ omni-channel jouneys and add value all the way across this complex ecosystem of interactions, some historical models of analysis may no longer be able to cope with today’s cross-silo, omni-channel reality that requires end-to-end insights for many teams across the business. In this article we examine various useful, relevant, data science based approaches on which modern executives can rely to understand this new interconnected reality, allowing them to understand, nurture and grow their customer relationships, even in times of uncertainty and rapid change. We use examples of how traditionally marketing department-led activities such as customer segmentation and marketing investment analysis can evolve into a more cross-functional approach delivering better insights and, importantly, more value to the business. © 2022, Henry Stewart Publications.

Sustainability creates an important driver for organizational design: the way organizations operate and the way they should be designed. New thinking is required for designing organizations focusing on: strategy, structure, processes, and human skills and values to create a sustainable organization for the future. Sustainability must penetrate all activities and all relations in the firm. Integrating such a perspective into production, communication, supply chain, marketing, as well as in strategy, structure, processes, resources, products, and customer relations takes appropriate incentives and understanding of what drives people to create impact and change the way they do things. It all comes down to: how can we create Incentives to stimulate Innovation through the Integration of sustainability in a way that creates the biggest Impact? In this point-of-view paper, we make three points: (1) Sustainability will be a major driver for business strategy now and in the future.

The journey toward change commenced in mid-2019 when the company scrutinised how influencer marketing was being approached across the business. One of the initial observations was that the data trail was very limited, which made it impossible to quantify the value, if any, it was having on the business. In response to this discovery, the organisation formalised a workflow to tighten its influencer marketing efforts. Since then, Bang & Olufsen has taken a far more effective approach to working with influencers across local markets, developing guidelines as well as more stringent review and reporting processes.

We observe that heterogeneous technologies create workflow gaps within which health professionals adapt technology use to contingencies and local needs, prioritize interventions, and identify problems before they become detrimental to patient care. These adaptations provide opportunities for health professionals to continuously align work across heterogeneous technologies and to accomplish broader professional and ideological goals. Our analysis shows that health professionals use three coordination practices when working across heterogeneous technologies: controlling and enhancing information, reconstructing workflows, and circumventing requirements. We theorize how these practices address coordination needs associated with heterogeneous technologies and discuss implications for knowledge work.

However, despite the growing market for mobility-on-demand (MOD), empirical studies on the operational characteristics of ride-sourcing systems are sparse. This paper provides an exploratory analysis of the operations of ride-sourcing using large-scale dis-aggregate mobility service data and documents the findings. From a case study in Singapore, we found that the demand follows reproducible patterns, which allows for realistic estimates of fleet operations over time and space. High travel demand during peak periods is observed along with a surge in prices (by 1.6 times on average). Shift behavior such as number of shifts, shift duration, and choices of shift start and end time affect fleet operations and fleet utilization rate. From the user metrics, we found that passengers may experience higher waiting and travel time due to the longer distance required to pickup in residential areas, the network congestion in commercial and business districts, and the detouring effects for sharing. Finally, the driver's total and marginal revenue were analyzed, which indicated a lower average revenue per unit time, distance, and service item in a shared ride compared to a single ride. These empirical observations can help understand the spatio-temporal characteristics of ride-sourcing operations in an urban area and provide insights for transportation planning and operations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Big mobility data; Mobility-on-demand (MOD); On-demand fleet operation; Ride-sourcing; Transportation Network Company (TNC)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129947307

However, this generalisation misses the when of relations, which is a problem, as management control practices are not always related, for example, because they often have their own domain attached to an organisational entity's tasks. This paper reports on a study of a firm's (Automaker) management control of its supply chain. This was organised as two types of concern – risk and performance management – that were delegated to two organisational entities each having its associated management control practices. This organisation was a delegation of responsibilities, decision rights and control practices.

The aim of this study is to explore how action learning processes can strengthen MHP capacity within and across organizations in a community setting. We applied an embedded case study design and a realist evaluation framework to explore key combinations of mechanisms and contextual factors that generated the emergent MHP capacity outcomes of an action learning program, i.e. context-mechanism-outcome-configurations (CMO-configurations). Data consisted of 18 semi-structured face-to-face interviews, 10 telephone interviews, two group interviews, observations, and documents. Interviewees (n = 21) were participants and management employees. Our analytical provision of CMO-configurations provides insights into how contextual factors, such as participant motivation, organizational support, and existing task descriptions, in combination with certain program mechanisms, such as legitimization of specific agendas, learning-by-doing, and collaborations across organizational boundaries, explain the identified outcomes. Outcomes ranged across implementation of MHP initiatives, personal development among participants, and relational and collaborative development. Taken together, our results strengthen the notion that mechanisms of action learning hold the potential to build MHP capacity on an individual, organizational, and community level.

We designed an experiment that allows us to isolate social comparison from other channels whereby the social context can affect risk decisions. The design also allows us to find impacts of the social reference point both if the individual cares about the distance to the social reference point and if she cares about her rank. Thus, we compare risk-taking in isolation to risk-taking with various exogenously imposed social reference points.

Taking an employee-driven innovation approach, this study enlarges the lens to also include nonmanagerial employees. Compared with champions and people in promotor roles, nonmanagerial employees' championing has received little attention in research. We help in filling this gap by analysing longitudinal questionnaire data from 152 employees from a Danish branch of a global IT consultancy company, who replied to all three questionnaire waves. We investigated how stable championing is across time and examined the relationship between political skills, positive affect, championing behaviour and employee salary level. The findings reveal that employees' level of championing is rather stable. Moreover, the higher level of political skill employees report to have, the more they engage in championing. High levels of positive affect strengthen this relationship between political skill and championing. Additionally, the results reveal a relationship between the level of championing behaviour and the employee's salary band level. This study adds to the extant research in champion and promoter role theories by showing that a sociopolitical approach is also relevant for a broader range of employees. © 2022 The Authors.

The robot-mediated interview tests the concept of a fair proxy in the shape of a teleoperated social robot. In Study 1, a mini-public (n=53) revealed four factors that influence fairness perceptions of the robot-mediated interview and showed how HR professionals’ perception of fair personnel selection is influenced by moral pragmatism despite clear moral awareness of discriminative biases in interviews. In Study 2, an experimental survey (n=242) conducted at an unemployment center showed that the respondents perceived the robot-mediated interview as fairer than the face-to-face interview. Overall, the studies suggest that HR professionals and jobseekers exhibit diverging fairness perceptions and that the business case for the robot-mediated interview undermines its social case (i.e., reducing discrimination).

However, knowledge from customers and users is not always easily translated into solutions that can be commercialized. Micro-level challenges of open innovation projects that might be impeding commercialization remain under-explored in the literature. To address this research gap, we use a collaborative staging approach inspired by actor-network theory to focus on micro-level negotiations of actors' concerns at the project level.

Our findings reveal an action-oriented staging approach to collaborative open innovation efforts and selective enactment of business models depending on whether the focus is value capture or value creation. Furthermore, we point to a repertoire of staging moves that managers and designers can use to facilitate productive negotiations and network alignment as value creation opportunities co-evolve and to conceptualize value offers in collaborative open innovation processes. © 2022 The Authors.

A major challenge for an efficient and profitable integration of the organic Rankine cycle unit is presented by the highly transient nature of the waste heat during a driving cycle. In order to cope with the rapid fluctuations of the waste heat and to ensure safe operation, advanced control techniques have gained particular attention in the last decade. This paper presents novel high-order advanced feedforward control concepts for organic Rankine cycle units that improve the performance of classical proportional integral controllers. The proposed approach enables the use of high-order nonlinear models for feedforward control of organic Rankine cycle systems, therefore allowing for more accurate estimation of the desired control action. As a reference, a proportional integral controller with feedforward is presented, acting on the pump mass flow rate to control the degree of superheating at the turbine inlet, which is a key variable to ensure high power output and safe operation of the organic Rankine cycle system. Static, linear and nonlinear dynamic inversed-model feedforward controllers were integrated with a classical proportional integral controller and numerically evaluated under a realistic waste heat profile of a heavy-duty truck. The results suggest that the static and the linear feedforward concepts do not offer any advantages compared with the classical proportional integral controller, because they result in a higher absolute mean square tracking error and a higher cumulative controller effort. Instead, the high-order nonlinear dynamic inversed-model feedforward controller introduced in this work offers important advantages compared with the classical proportional integral controller by reducing the absolute root mean square tracking error from 10.8 K to 2.2 K without excessively increasing the controller cumulative effort (limited to 1.9%/s). On the contrary, the classical proportional integral controller could optimize only one of the objectives at the expenses of the other. The proposed control approach significantly improves the operation of the organic Rankine cycle unit, limiting the fluctuations of the degree of superheating and keeping this quantity within ±7 K of the desired set point. Thus, the novel feedforward concept will be highly beneficial in integrating classical proportional integral control of organic Rankine cycle units that involve highly transient heat sources. © 2022 The Authors","Advanced control; Feedforward; Heavy-duty vehicle; Organic Rankine cycle","Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Feedforward control; Proportional control systems; Rankine cycle; Solid wastes; Two term control systems; Vehicles; Waste heat; Advanced control; Cycle systems; Driving cycle; Feed forward; Feed-forward controllers; Heavy duty vehicles; High-order; Higher-order; Proportional integral controllers; Safe operation; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127493298

To investigate the factors affecting the distribution of metal(loid)s, various physicochemical and microbial properties were analyzed in 70 soil and water samples taken from a waste rock pile field. The results were analyzed using different methods, such as interpolation and multivariate statistical analyses. The results showed that the distribution of metal(loid)s in the topsoil (0–20 cm) was characterized by large variations in Cu (38.33–5834.18 mg/kg), Cd (0.14–29.29 mg/kg), Cr (7.08–326.16 mg/kg), and As (3.68–91.06 mg/kg). The mean pH value of the soil in the waste rock pile field was 3.85, while it was 5.03 outside of the rock pile. The Shannon–Wiener diversity and Chao's richness indices decreased from 5.46 and 1855.62 outside of the rock pile to 3.95 and 817.82 inside the rock pile, respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis indicated that significant spatial heterogeneity in the soil properties led to differences in the metal(loid) fractions, and the residual fraction of different metal(loid)s varied from 20.69% to 99.98%. Acidification of the media and increasing the number of acidophilic bacteria mobilized Cu and Cr but did not affect As. Mobilization of Cu/Cr iron oxides and organic matter (OM) on As was detected in situ compared with previous studies. The results of this study can provide useful reference data for the remediation of metal(loid)–contaminated soil in acidic waste rock pile fields. © 2022","Acidophilic bacteria; Contamination distribution; metal(loid) fraction; Polymetallic sulfide mine; Waste rock pile field","Bacteria; Chromium; Copper mines; Copper oxides; Heavy metals; Iron oxides; Physicochemical properties; Piles; Remediation; Rocks; Soil pollution; Soils; Zinc sulfide; Acidophilic bacteria; Contamination distribution; Distribution of metal; Metal(loid) fraction; Metal(loid)s; Polymetallic; Polymetallic sulphide mine; Rock pile; Waste rock pile field; Waste rocks; Multivariant analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127365987

Recent experimental work suggests that behavioural insights-based interventions in the immediate choice context may create opportunities for sustainable food-behaviour change. Among the many actors and elements of a complex food system, supermarkets are in a unique position as main gatekeepers to curate the interface between supply and demand and steer both in more sustainable directions. Sustainability-oriented retailers can use innovative behavioural tools to promote healthier and climate-friendlier foods (such as vegetables) while meeting the “triple bottom line”. A real-life supermarket trial in Denmark tested if multi-layered nudges can increase the purchase of fruit and vegetables. The intervention led to small increases in sales. These findings showcase the possibility that supermarkets, in principle, have agency and ability to nudge consumers towards more sustainable diets. To meaningfully shift consumers’ consumption patterns, supermarkets need an open sharing of best practices and the use of a sound methodology to better understand and effectively change consumer behaviour. In partnership with stakeholders, supermarkets could play a more active role in fostering a sustainable food transition by employing “nudges for good”. © 2022","Behavioural interventions; Behavioural sustainability innovation; Fruit and vegetable consumption; Healthy and sustainable diets; In-store promotion; Sustainable retail","Fruits; Purchasing; Retail stores; Sustainable development; Vegetables; Behavioral interventions; Behavioral sustainability innovation; Behaviour changes; Complex food system; Fruit and vegetable consumption; Fruit and vegetables; Healthy and sustainable diet; In-store promotion; Sustainable retail; Triple Bottom Line; Sales; food consumption; food supply; innovation; sustainability; sustainable development; technological development; vegetable",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126523466

However, little attention was given to large urban freight traffic generators, e.g., shopping malls and commercial buildings with offices and retail. These pose different challenges to manage freight vehicle parking demand, due to the limited parking options. To study these, we propose an agent-based simulation approach which integrates data-driven parking-choice models and a demand/supply simulation model. A case study compares demand management strategies (DMS), influencing parking choices, and their impact in reducing freight vehicle parking externalities, such as traffic congestion. DMS include changes to parking capacity, availability, and pricing as well as services (centralized receiving) and technology-based solutions (directed parking). The case study for a commercial region in Singapore shows DMS can improve travel time, parking costs, emission levels and reducing the queuing. This study contributes with a generalizable method, and to local understanding of technology and policy potential. The latter can be of value for managers of large traffic generators and public authorities as a way to understand to select suitable DMS. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based simulation; City logistics; Demand management strategies; Freight parking; Parking choice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126366984

Or, in cases where the state enjoys high capacity, the state instead compensates for liberalization but ends up crowding out employer coordination. In both cases, the result is decreasing employer coordination. We argue that in CMEs, the state may also play the role of “orchestrator” by supporting the revitalization of employer coordination. It does so through the deployment of ideational and institutional resources that mobilize employers’ associations on a voluntary basis.

This is a challenge for educators as it is difficult to develop instructional strategies to foster students’ EM when there is no clarity about what this mindset is. The purpose of the article is to address this challenge. It does so by analysing and synthesizing current literature in the field of entrepreneurship education in HEIs and develops a taxonomy that depicts three dominant conceptualizations of EM, their theoretical origins and the type of attributes typically associated with each conceptualization. The article goes beyond the integrative literature review by reflecting on the consequences for the design of entrepreneurship education of the simultaneous existence of these three dominant conceptualizations. The author develops a typology for aligning instructional strategies with the EM conceptualizations and thus contributes to practice by providing a better understanding of how to achieve coherence between learning outcomes and instructional choices.

In the world of patent litigation, however, one of the most important remedies is the preliminary injunction (PI), whereby an allegedly infringing competitor is forced to stop selling the goods in the market in the interim period before the court reaches its final decision on the merits. In spite of this, the economic literature has afforded little attention to PIs. This article uses a simple economic model to investigate how a Patent Holder and an Alleged Infringer will behave with and without the PI instrument. We show that party behavior depends on the probability that the Patent Holder does indeed have a valid patent and will prevail in a final court decision and on the extent to which courts can determine damages correctly. We find that while patent rights benefit the Patent Holder, the PI instrument to a large extent benefits the Alleged Infringer. It does so by insuring him against large damages payments and allowing him to receive compensation for actions not taken, i.e. for not being on the market in the interim period before the final court decision.

This new wave of scholarship mitigated some of the problems of the original, theory-driven discussions from the 1970s and 1980s. But despite significant advancements in the empirical identification of business power, we lack a unified framework for studying its working mechanisms. So-called hybrid approaches, drawing on instrumental and structural power for their analyses, display high potential for such a unified and easily applicable framework. We build on this hybrid tradition and propose a novel model that integrates instrumental and structural power analysis into a basic framework. With this, we recalibrate the often rigid division between instrumental and structural power forms and emphasize the role of perceptions as key for understanding the dynamics of business power over time. We illustrate this parsimonious framework by an analysis of the plans of the Dutch government to abolish a dividend tax in 2018 that would have benefited a number of large multinationals but collapsed before implementation.

This study takes leadership practice, not the classroom, as its point of departure. Leadership studies have demonstrated the romance in leadership theory of an individual, stable, and coherent leadership figure, even if this figure does not connect to actual practices. In other streams of research, practice increasingly appears to be a resource for less presumptuous theorizing about leadership. These more situationally sensitive approaches call for equivalent leadership development practices, and extant literature in particular has escaped the confines of the executive management classroom to only a limited extent. While experiential learning has proved an efficient means of instigating and harvesting in-classroom experiences for subsequent reflection and learning, translating these experiences into (later) leadership practice has proved problematic. The mundanity of practice rarely corresponds to the theoretical exposés emanating from classrooms. Using a leadership development program (LDP) as our case, we explore accounts from managers carrying out in-practice experiments and analyze these processes in light of Dewey’s notion of experimentalism. Identifying a series of attributes associated with the experimental intervention, we illuminate some future avenues for situated leadership development as well as offer considerations for leadership development practice. © The Author(s) 2021.","Dewey; experiential learning; experimentalism; leadership development; post-heroic leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122092717

We also examine the degree to which the MNC can facilitate best practices in their plants by allocating organizational and human resources. We test our hypotheses using survey data from subsidiary managers and secondary company data (n = 129), supplemented with manager interviews (n = 14), collected from European, U.S., and Asian MNCs with subsidiary plants in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and North Macedonia. Results indicate that the subsidiary plants adopt practices that are common in the MNC home country. They do so to a greater extent when the MNC commits organizational resources to the plants, such as codified written procedures and trainings. Contrary to our expectations, there is no benefit to allocating human resources, such as expatriates and business travelers.

Market characteristics such as time resolution, the time of market offering and the information available at this time, price elasticities of demand and the number of market participants, allow producers to exercise market power to different degrees. To capture this, we study oligopolistic spot and balancing markets with Cournot competition, and formulate two stochastic equilibrium models for the sequential markets. The first is an open-loop model which we formulate and solve as a complementarity problem. The second is a closed-loop model that accounts for the sequence of market clearings, but is computationally more demanding. Via optimality conditions, the result is an equilibrium problem with equilibrium constraints which we solve by an iterative procedure. When compared to the closed-loop solution, our results show that the open-loop problem overestimates the ability to exercise market power unless the market allows for speculation. In the presence of a speculator, the open-loop formulation forces spot and balancing market prices to be equal in expectation and indicates substantial profit reductions, whereas speculation has less severe impact in the closed-loop problem. We use the closed-loop model to further analyse market power issues with a higher time resolution and limited access to the balancing market. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Complementarity modelling; Cournot competition; Electricity markets; Market power; Stochastic programming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119301617

Offering advanced services requires companies to engage in and manage win–win collaborations with a diverse set of service network partners. However, there is currently a lack of insights into the value co-creation challenges faced by manufacturers’ R&D units and their service network partners. Equally, there is a pressing need for roles to be properly aligned when offering advanced services in global markets. Based on 34 exploratory interviews with respondents from two manufacturers and their six globally dispersed front-end service network partners, this study identifies diverse co-creation challenges related to the provision of advanced services in global markets. The results show that complex collaborations of this nature often do not lead to win–win relationships but rather to less understood win–lose or lose–win scenarios. Our proposed framework unpacks how to manage value co-creation challenges and establish win–win relationships through role alignment. This study’s findings show that the successful provision of advanced services requires manufacturers to play the role of global service orchestrators and service network partners to act as global service integrators. Thus, role alignment provides greater latitude to establish a joint sphere of value co-creation for back-end and front-end actors. We conclude by discussing this paper’s theoretical and practical contributions to the emerging literature on servitization in global markets and global service networks. © 2021 The Authors.

Nevertheless, most research treats this dissolution with a sense of finality. Using the Danish Integrated Database for Labor Market Research (IDA), we explore the persistence of cofounders and early employees to continue their work relationships after the dissolution of the new venture. We investigate where these team members continue their career and whether they pursue entrepreneurship together in another new venture. Overall, over 18.3% move jointly, and comobility is more prevalent among new venture team members who worked jointly prior to founding the new venture and among those new venture teams demonstrating high levels of homogeneity. Moreover, comovers tend toward small firms, and comobility occurs largely in similar industry. A large share of comovers move to new ventures, which is indicative of serial or habitual new venture teams.

This research seeks to understand how the COVID-19 event leads to impacts, lessons, and proposed solutions for the operations of global supply chains. This study is based on a structured review of publications released on or before 31 December 2020. It includes established academic publications but also those emerging primarily from academic institutions in trade magazines and on the wider internet. Specifically, four research questions are addressed: How and where are disruptions caused by COVID-19 understood to impact global supply chains? How does the literature portray supply chain lessons from the COVID-19-related disruptions? How does the literature portray the suggested resilience-driven solutions for the future operation of global supply chains? Finally, how are digital technologies proposed as part of resilience-driven solutions to the future operation of global supply chains? Concerning the findings, the study contributes by developing a new theoretical understanding of the ongoing collective supply chain lessons of the COVID-19 disruption. Six supply chain vulnerabilities, six solutions or resilience capabilities and seven technology clusters deemed particularly useful in mitigating future pandemic disruptions are identified. In addition, the interrelationships between the different elements are explored and understood as an ongoing learning process comprising a process of evoking vulnerabilities, a process of reacting and devising change and a process of implementing change. Based on these findings, a set of managerial implications and avenues for future research are proposed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112312100

In this study, we examine organizations’ efforts to manage their stakeholders’ impressions of their possible guilt in this period of uncertainty. The study examines the discursive guilt-management strategies organizations employ in such situations to embrace the paradoxical tensions that emerge between their routine, positive self-presentations as responsible organizations and their communication about their possible guilt. Taking departure in impression management and a paradox perspective, we conceptualize guilt management as a discursive practice enacted in times of uncertainty. Specifically, we conduct a microlevel discourse analysis of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports published by large US banks after the financial crisis and analyze how these banks managed impressions of their possible guilt, before they eventually agreed to legal settlements. We identify amending, bracketing, shifting locus of control, implicating, as well as reattributing and extending moral agency as central guilt-management strategies that embrace the paradoxical tensions between the banks’ positive self-presentations and their communication about their possible guilt.

One reason for this is due to difficulties coordinating actors’ efforts to address socially responsible outcomes. Drawing on theories of bounded ethicality and incorporating work on communicating shared values in coordinating action this paper outlines the lack coordination as a matching issue, one complicated by underlying heterogeneity in actors’ moral values and thus motivation to address socially responsible outcomes. Three factors contribute to this matching problem. First, we argue it is not actors’ simple cognitive awareness, but their moral awareness of social issues that explains why certain actors move to address problems while others do not. In other words, actors may recognize sustainability problems, but are not motivated to solve them as they are not understood as moral problems. Second, we posit that progress requires alignment in issues that some actors find worth addressing whereas others do not, thus explaining how heterogeneity in moral perceptions interrupt coordination towards socially important goals. Finally, we propose that progress is undermined if actors myopically focus on level-specific outcomes in ways that elucidates why institutional responses often fail to address individual outcomes and vice versa. We use the existing literature on the socially important issue of food waste to examine our theoretical contribution and develop a typology that explains conditions that inhibit (or promote) coordination. Thus, our work proposes a psycho-structural view on matching and coordination toward sustainable outcomes, highlighting how psychological and structural constraints prevent effective coordination in addressing sustainability goals. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Bounded ethicality; Coordination; Food waste; Matching; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105453702

While most studies focus on how travelling ideas translate into organizational practices, we lack insights into the broader issue of how ideas translate as they move among heterogeneous actors across the field. To explore this multidirectional travelling of ideas, we build on the notion of translation ecology to capture the ongoing interactions among field members as they are involved in translation work within and outside adopting organizations. To develop our argument, we draw from a longitudinal, 20-year case study of a public sector digital transformation programme in Denmark through which ideas about mobile technology use for caregivers spread across the entire homecare field. By following the mobile technology initiative over time, we show how ideas travelled in multiple directions as adopting organizations and other influential field actors participated in and contributed to diverse practices across organizations. Based on our analyses, we identify three distinct forms of multidirectional idea travelling – reinforcing, complementing and polarizing – and describe how they together shape the morphing of ideas as they move among heterogeneous actors in a translation ecology. As a result, we advance knowledge about multidirectional idea travelling as an under-theorized and important perspective in the translation literature. © The Author(s) 2021.","digital transformation; idea travelling; multidirectional; organizational field; translation ecology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103158641

It thereby conceptualizes business students’ disciplinary specializations as a key dimension of the business school responsibility learning environment. Students use four main rationalizations to displace responsibility variously away from their own disciplinary specializations, to claim responsibility as the prerogative of their specialization, and to shift irresponsibility onto disciplinary out-groups. Yet despite their disciplinary identifications, students largely rationalized that their sense of responsibility was an individual matter that was unlikely to be affected by contextual influences, and they attributed irresponsible behavior to incorrigible ‘bad apples.’ A theoretical model is offered which illustrates these dynamics by combining Bandura’s social cognitive theory with social identity theory. The research is based on secondary data, specifically focus-group interviews conducted with undergraduate students at a major Scandinavian business school in connection with the implementation of the UN Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative. The implications for management education include the need to strengthen students’ ‘disciplinary reflexivity,’ and to explicitly address the tension between students’ disciplinary solidarities and their faith in their own individual moral infallibility. © 2021, The Author(s).","Business students; Disciplines; Management education; Moral disengagement; Moral reasoning; Personal responsibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101508586

There is, however, limited effort to synthesize current evidence on the mechanisms through which these businesses create social value. We systematically review the literature on BoP businesses, covering 110 studies published in business and management journals. We start by using bibliographic analysis to map the broad contours of the literature in terms of its common theoretical and empirical approaches, intellectual core, and evolution in time. We subsequently conduct a qualitative content analysis on the identified articles to synthesize their main findings. The analysis leads to a conceptual framework that explicates the antecedents, constraints, capabilities, and contingencies that drive social value creation. In addition to providing a rich and systematically organized account of the evidence, our analysis provides a critical reflection on the ethical dilemmas of social value creation efforts for the BoP, and outlines promising avenues for future research. © 2021, The Author(s).","Base of the pyramid (BoP); Ethical dilemmas; Social value; Systematic review",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099088266

Consistent with dynamic capabilities view and upper echelons theory, we suggest that GDMC leads to global asset orchestration, which in turn, results in superior company performance in a two-stage process. First, GDMC leads companies to adopt global strategies that spread the risk of internationalizations across different entry modes and geographic regions. Second, the (re)configuration of global assets positively influences subsequent firm performance and thus mediates the relationship between GDMC and performance. Recognizing the triad of factors that form global dynamic managerial capability is crucial when selecting future managers of multinational corporations. Hence, firms with increasing international exposure – both domestically via foreign competition and internationally via foreign market presence – may seek to compose their upper echelons with a suitable combination of international human and social capital as well as internationally diverse cognitions in the pursuit of sustained competitive advantage. © 2020, Academy of International Business.","dynamic managerial capabilities; global asset orchestration; international human capital; international managerial cognitions; international social capital; nationality diversity; performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086778477

However, many athletes continue to throw, despite pain in the shoulder. This study investigated upper body kinematics and muscle activation while throwing in female elite handball players with and without shoulder pain. Thirty female elite team handball players, 15 with pain (age 22.2 ± 2.9 yrs.) and 15 without pain (age 20.4 ± 2.6 yrs.) performed five standing throws in which joint kinematics and muscle activity were measured in the following muscles: pectoralis major, infraspinatus, serratus anterior, latissimus dorsi, and upper-, middle-, and lower trapezius. The main findings revealed that peak joint angles and angular velocities were not different between groups; however, group differences were observed in earlier timing of position and longer time spent in maximal shoulder extension and external shoulder rotation in the pain group compared with the no pain group. The pain group also revealed a significant lower muscle peak activity in the serratus anterior during the cocking phase compared to the no pain group. After the cocking phase and at ball release, the groups had similar activation. In conclusion, the present study showed group differences in appearance and time spent in maximal humerus extension and external rotation and a different serratus anterior muscle peak activity between elite handball players playing with and without shoulder pain, which are identified as possible mechanisms of adaptation to avoid pain.

Among the very first to address the issue of modelling adult mortality in small populations was the SAINT model, which has been used for pricing, reserving and longevity risk management by the Danish Labour Market Supplementary Pension Fund (ATP) for more than a decade. The lessons learned have broadened our understanding of desirable model properties from the practitioner's point of view and have led to a revision of model components to address accuracy, stability, flexibility, explainability and credibility concerns. This paper serves as an update to the original version published 10 years ago and presents the SAINT model with its modifications and the rationale behind them. The main improvement is the generalization of frailty models from deterministic structures to a flexible class of stochastic models. We show by example how the SAINT framework is used for modelling mortality at ATP and make comparisons to the Lee-Carter model. ©","EM algorithm; frailty; Lee-Carter model; mortality modelling; multi-population modelling; SAINT model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124214659

Design/methodology/approach: The change between three different reservation and distribution systems in an airline company was assessed over 20 years based on qualitative data collected while events unfolded and interviews that traced events retrospectively. Findings: This study finds that data integration challenges affect the capacity to use revenue and sales data for control purposes and integrating with suppliers and customers. The systems either facilitated the ability to integrate sales and accounting data or enabled integration in wider supplier and customer networks. The implementation of different reservation and distribution systems resulted in a trade-off between integration within the firm and into wider customer and supplier networks.

More precisely, the aim of this article is to critically assess the claim that esports fails to be sports because it is never properly “direct” or “immediate” compared to physical sports. To do so, I focus on the account of physicality presented by Jason Holt, who provides a theoretical framework meant to justify the claim that esports is never properly immediate and therefore never sports. I begin by motivating Holt's account of physicality by contrasting it with a more classical way of discussing physicality and sports, namely in terms of physical motor skills. Afterwards, I introduce Holt's account of physicality as immediacy and engage with its assumptions more thoroughly to problematize the claim that esports is fundamentally indirect. Lastly, I argue that the assumption that esports necessarily lacks immediacy is based on a narrow understanding of body and, consequently, of space. In response, I offer a different way of thinking about body and space, focusing on the subjective, bodily engagement of the esports practitioners with their practice, whereby physical space and virtual space can be appreciated as immediately interconnected during performance in a hybrid manner. In providing such an account, the article contributes directly to the broader, growing discussion on the relationship between physicality and virtuality in an increasingly digital world.

Inspired by a recent Danish community project called Your Health, this paper sheds light on the nexus of health promotion, sport and well-being, and how an increased focus on synergies can improve public health capacity in the future. Design/methodology/approach: The three areas of interests are presented, and challenges and opportunities are discussed along with the lessons learned from the Danish community project serving as an example of an integrated approach. The project was hosted by a sports club with the aim to enhance the health and well-being of new members, engage volunteers as health motivators and develop new activities in partnership with community organizations. Findings: The discussion on creating synergies between sport, health promotion and well-being inspired a new model encouraging moving away from silo-thinking towards the sweet-spot where all three perspectives are represented. In this way, public health can be developed to the next level, in particular with regards to actions taking place outside the health sector. Research limitations/implications: More research is warranted to develop the evidence that can push for a changed policy agenda and showcase the social and economic return on investments. Practical implications: There is a growing interest to support health and well-being. Capacity building is needed to engage non-health stakeholders actively in the health agenda. Originality/value: Despite the need for progress, research is still scarce. Thus, it is important to create a new momentum among relevant stakeholders to facilitate the integration of sport, health promotion and well-being to qualify and expand public health capacity, create better health for all and bridge inequity. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioral; Communication; Determinants of health; Organization; Political strategy; Public health; Social or mental health issues","adult; article; capacity building; community; female; health promotion; human; human experiment; investment; male; mental health; public health; sport; thinking; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127229342

The reputation of a denomination will thus be an important guide for consumers when assessing individual wines. Design/methodology/approach: The price–quality relationship is studied in a fairly homogenous geographical area where a large number of wine types is present. This is done by using a simple ordinary least squares (OLS) analysis on a database of more than 2,000 different red wines produced in a period of just four years in only one Italian region. Findings: The results show that some denominations have a lower average quality score and that price differentials between denominations are linked to differences in average quality, although consumers tend to exaggerate the quality gap between prestigious denominations and others. Research limitations/implications: A producer in a prestigious denomination benefits from a substantial mark-up relative to an equally good producer from another denomination. Furthermore, denomination neutral wines have a stronger price–quality relationship than denomination specific wines. Practical implications: Consumers should not be misled by what is on the bottle, but should rather consult wine guides to become better informed before purchasing. Social implications: The fact that quality and sensory characteristics often play a minor role in determining the price of a commodity is not immediately compatible with the postulate that consumers are well informed. Originality/value: Unlike previous work, this paper investigates a limited area (Tuscany) and only red wines, thus making it possible implicitly to control for many other factors which might otherwise confound the price–quality relationship. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Italy; Price-quality relationship; Wines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118151919

Various underlying causes of LEA have been reported, including disordered eating behavior (DE), but studies investigating the association with exercise addiction and food intolerances are lacking. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between DE, exercise addiction and food intolerances in athletes at risk of LEA compared to those with low risk. Female endurance athletes, 18–35 years, training ≥5 times/week were recruited in Norway, Sweden, Ireland, and Germany. Participants completed an online-survey comprising the LEA in Females Questionnaire (LEAF-Q), Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), and questions regarding food intolerances. Of the 202 participants who met the inclusion criteria and completed the online survey, 65% were at risk of LEA, 23% were at risk of exercise addiction, and 21% had DE. Athletes at risk of LEA had higher EDE-Q and EAI scores compared to athletes with low risk. EAI score remained higher in athletes with risk of LEA after excluding athletes with DE. Athletes at risk of LEA did not report more food intolerances (17 vs. 10%, P = 0.198), but were more frequently reported by athletes with DE (28 vs. 11%, P = 0.004). In conclusion, these athletes had a high risk of LEA, exercise addiction, and DE. Exercise addiction should be considered as an additional risk factor in the prevention, early detection, and targeted treatment of RED-S among female endurance athletes.

In response, numerous models have been advanced to predict and explain people’s choices between gambles. Although some of these models have had a great impact in the behavioral, social, and management sciences, there is little consensus about which model offers the best account of choice behavior. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale comparison of 58 prominent models of risky choice, using 19 existing behavioral data sets involving more than 800 participants. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate models in terms of individual-level predictive performance across a range of different choice settings. We also identify the psychological mechanisms that lead to superior predictive performance and the properties of choice stimuli that favor certain types of models over others. Moreover, drawing on research on the wisdom of crowds, we argue that each of the existing models can be seen as an expert that provides unique forecasts in choice predictions. Consistent with this claim, we find that crowds of risky choice models perform better than individual models and thus provide a performance bound for assessing the historical accumulation of knowledge in our field. Our results suggest that each model captures unique aspects of the decision process and that existing risky choice models offer complementary rather than competing accounts of behavior. We discuss the implications of our results on theories of risky decision making and the quantitative modeling of choice behavior.

This paper investigates the use of consumption ""subaggregates""instead. The use of consumption subaggregates is theoretically justified if and only if all Engel curves are linear for any realization of prices. This is very stringent. However, it may be possible to empirically identify certain goods that happen to have linear Engel curves given prevailing prices, and when the effect of price changes is small, such a subaggregate might work in practice. The paper constructs such linear subaggregates using data from Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. The findings show that using subaggregates is ill advised in practice as well as in theory. This also raises questions about the consistency of the poverty tracking efforts currently applied across countries, since obtaining exhaustive consumption measures remains an unmet challenge. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

The response rate of these campaigns is the result of the complex interaction between several factors, such as the theme of the campaign, the month in which the campaign is launched, the history of past donations from the potential donor, as well as several other variables. This work, applied on relevant data gathered from the World Wide Fund for Nature Italian marketing department, undertakes different data mining approaches in order to predict future donors and non-donors, thus allowing for optimization in the target selection for future campaigns, reducing its overall costs. The main challenge of this research is the presence of thoroughly imbalanced classes, given the low percentage of responses per total items sent. Different techniques that tackle this problem have been applied. Their effectiveness in avoiding a biased classification, which is normally tilted in favor of the most populated class, will be highlighted. Finally, this work shows and compares the classification results obtained with the combination of sampling techniques and Decision Trees, ensemble methods, and Artificial Neural Networks. The testing approach follows a walk-forward validation procedure, which simulates a production environment and reveals the ability to accurately classify each future campaign. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","direct marketing; machine learning; target selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129289862

We exploit blockchain transaction transparency to map millions of transfers for hundreds of large on-chain service providers. The mapped data set permits us to empirically conduct several analyses. First, we analyze abnormal transfer volume in the vicinity of large-scale highly visible terrorist attacks. We document evidence consistent with heightened activity in coin wallets belonging to unregulated exchanges and mixer services—central to laundering funds between terrorist groups and operatives on the ground. Next, we use forensic accounting techniques to follow the trails of funds associated with the Sri Lanka Easter bombing. Insights from this event corroborate our findings and aid in our construction of a blockchain-based predictive model. Finally, using machine-learning algorithms, we demonstrate that fund trails have predictive power in out-of-sample analysis.

As a portfolio, M&A management is part of the ongoing integration efforts within organisations that have grown via M&As.

Such variability might manifest as schedule variations, which can jeopardize the project performance, especially when using deterministic scheduling. Current scheduling techniques fail to efficiently tackle variability and rely on deterministic approaches. Therefore, this study fills the gap by developing a discrete event simulation model, where activity durations are modeled using beta distributions and program evaluation and review technique assumptions. By applying the Spearman correlation coefficient, activities with higher influence on the schedule were identified, highlighting where to reduce variability. An application example was conducted involving a critical path method (CPM) network containing 11 activities. Two types of waste emerging due to variability were identified as waiting time and variation gaps. Out of the 11 activities in the example network, two sets of critical activities were identified. Results revealed that an 80% reduction in variability in these critical activities led to a 51.9% increase in likelihood of completing the project on schedule, 30% decrease in waiting time, and 28.6% decrease in variation gap. An important implication of this research is that near-critical paths could become critical based on the amount of variability contained in the activities lying on each path. Acquiring such information early on during planning provides proactive, eye-opening insights into potential problematic scheduling areas. The study's contributions include investigating the variability effect on two types of waste in production and providing project planners with a stochastic approach to manage the hidden waste in production systems; the approach examines the effect of reducing variability on the overall project performance characterized by meeting deadlines, avoiding trade idling (reducing waiting time), and exploring potential opportunities for enhancing performance (reducing variation gaps). © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Construction industry; Discrete event simulation; Stochastic systems; Turnaround time; 'current; Construction activities; Critical activities; Critical Paths; Deterministic scheduling; Flow variability; Project performance; Resources inputs; Simultaneous integration; Waiting time; Scheduling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127036519

In order to develop a conceptual framework to capture the market-shaping potential of a crisis, we integrate insights from risk management and strategic management, and discuss their implications for market shaping. As such, this paper builds a bridge between the reactive nature of crisis management during a crisis and proactive market shaping, and offers new insights into market shaping based on an underutilized source of inspiration, namely crisis management. Based on resilience (from risk management) and responsiveness (from strategic management), we propose four market-shaping opportunities.

Despite the need for communication in such situations, team members often fail to share essential information. To examine why team communication and coordination fail, we develop a formal model with boundedly rational team members that links team size with the incentives to coordinate and the costs of communication. We show that even very small communication costs are enough to offset the expected individual benefit of sharing information with the team. Absent effective routines, the least efficient outcome is the most likely in the short and long run. Further, simulations lend support to a number of organizational routines and responses: mandating communication improves coordination and more so if the mandate recurs periodically. Increasing the incentives to coordinate is more important than subsidizing communication costs, which often adds little value unless the subsidies cover the costs completely. The results match a broad range of findings from the experimental and organizational literature, help to explain and provide a theoretical foundation for why team collaborations involving several organizational units often fail, and suggest new tests for promising communication routines. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Authority; Communication; Coordination; Routines; Teams",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126908130

We contribute by drawing on activity theory to explain the development of autonomous solutions as epistemic objects.

Furthermore, we explain how epistemic objects, mediated by using tools, enable the move toward autonomous solutions that create value. In so doing, we argue that ‘autonomous’ solutions are never completely autonomous in the sense that they can exist on their own as objects; they require many other mediating tools to bring them into existence and through which they evolve.

This linear focus on the net effects for single stakeholders, such as farmers and producers, local communities and ecosystems, falls short of adequately capturing the broader impact of certifications across social and ecological dimensions. Inspired by theories on complex systems thinking, we present a framework based on a systems-based impact logic that better captures and assesses the impacts of certification standards within broader social-ecological systems.

The prioritization of circular economy (CE) adoption barriers is one such complex problem that cannot be solved using current classical methods. Hence, in this paper, for the first time, a new method, namely, FBWDS, is developed. FBWDS derives from the combination of fuzzy best–worst method (BWM), fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and Supermatrix structure. This proposed method establishes weights of the intertwined factors in hierarchical networks under uncertainty; these weighted factors and their interdependencies are calculated using the fuzzy BWM and fuzzy DEMATEL techniques, respectively. In addition, the Supermatrix structure is applied to integrate the results of these two techniques. The proposed approach efficiency is evaluated in the field of the CE adoption barriers using data from a cable and wire industry in Iran. The results showed that “high setup costs,” “financial limitations,” and “absence of public awareness about CE” rank as the most challenging barriers, and “lack of standards for designing recycled products” and “absence of standard system to evaluate performance” are the least important barriers to CE adoption in the cable and wire industry. © 2022 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","best–worst method; circular economy adoption barriers; DEMATEL; fuzzy theory; multi-criteria decision-making","decision making; fuzzy mathematics; manufacturing; matrix; multivariate analysis; sustainability; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125375468

In China, green rewards significantly increased recycling intentions via introjected motivation. In the USA, rewards improved intentions mainly via extrinsic motivation. In Germany, green appeals appeared to be the best strategy. Extrinsic rewards are expected to reduce perceived autonomy support, but only did so in the USA.

However, this crowd involvement tends to be confined to empirical work and it is not clear whether and how crowds can also be involved in conceptual stages such as formulating the questions that research is trying to address. Drawing on five different “paradigms” of crowdsourcing and related mechanisms, we first discuss potential merits of involving crowds in the formulation of research questions (RQs). We then analyze data from two crowdsourcing projects in the medical sciences to describe key features of RQs generated by crowd members and compare the quality of crowd contributions to that of RQs generated in the conventional scientific process. We find that the majority of crowd contributions are problem restatements that can be useful to assess problem importance but provide little guidance regarding potential causes or solutions. At the same time, crowd-generated research questions frequently cross disciplinary boundaries by combining elements from different fields within and especially outside medicine. Using evaluations by professional scientists, we find that the average crowd contribution has lower novelty and potential scientific impact than professional research questions, but comparable practical impact. Crowd contributions outperform professional RQs once we apply selection mechanisms at the level of individual contributors or across contributors. Our findings advance research on crowd and citizen science, crowdsourcing and distributed knowledge production, as well as the organization of science. We also inform ongoing policy debates around the involvement of citizens in research in general, and agenda setting in particular. © 2022 The Authors","Agenda setting; Citizen science; Crowd science; Crowdsourcing; Organization of science; Problem finding; Problem solving","Professional aspects; Agenda settings; Citizen science; Crowd science; General publics; Medical science; Organization of science; Problem finding; Problem-solving; Professional systems; Research questions; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123927970

These radical forces appear to increase the pressure on internal and external organizational stakeholders to recognize, adopt and adapt to new technologies in order to sustain organizational competitiveness. This research subsequently investigates the key drivers in the organizational adoption of 3DPT to identify whether adoption is driven by a desire for homogeneity, or by a purely rationalistic evaluation of the perceived intrinsic value of the technology for the organization. This research surveyed 114 manufacturing firms operating in the Mexican footwear cluster to identify the impact of complex institutional forces on the adoption of radical 3DPT technologies. Data was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling, concluding that mimetic, alongside normative, isomorphic pressures, exerted a substantial impact on the 3DPT adoption decision. While competitor behavior appeared to represent significant driver for adoption, our results also indicated that normative forces acted decisively on evaluations of the technology's perceived value. We found no evidence of coercive pressures, also noting a negative relationship between low adoption rates and institutional potential. The study concludes with an observation that isomorphism can be leveraged to actuate adoption rates, with recommendations for further research identified and research limitations addressed. © 2021 The Authors","3d printing; Additive manufacturing; Institutional theory; Mediation; Mexico; PLS-SEM; Radical technology; Technology adoption","Industrial research; Least squares approximations; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Institutional theory; Me-xico; Mediation; Organisational; PLS-SEM; Printing technologies; Radical technology; Technology adoption; 3D printers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119598284

Addressing the interplay between the consistency and individualization perspectives in a sample of 870 employees nested in 36 firms, we present evidence suggesting that individualized HR decisions positively affect firm performance only in the presence of strong firm-level HR practices.

Psychological and sociological research suggests that homophily is most pronounced along ideological lines, with conflicting evidence as to whether this tendency is higher among individuals who hold liberal or conservative beliefs. Based on this literature, we conduct the first study of ideological homophily in two key organizational networks: the intrafirm connections among directors on the board and the interfirm connections created by board interlocks. Research insights: In a panel of 408 U.S. firms between 2000 and 2020, we find that liberalism increases homophily both within and between boards. Furthermore, we find that homophily has decreased over time but that this has been driven by conservative boards while the effect of liberalism has strengthened in recent years. These findings provide the first evidence for an ideological component in the composition of intra- and interorganizational networks. Academic implications: Most research on director selection and interlock formation has focused on situational or demographic antecedents. Our findings contribute to the development of a broader theoretical framework that accounts for individual dispositional factors in these processes. Practitioner implications: Our findings bring attention to the issue of ideological homogeneity in firms. Given the growth of homophilic tendencies among liberal directors in recent years, we suggest that it may be increasingly important for directors to become aware, and mitigate the effects, of their ideological biases in order to maintain cognitive diversity in information networks and decision making. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","board interlocks; boards of directors; corporate governance; homophily; social networks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117201878

While the existing literature provides significant intuition regarding the factors that influence these choices, it often assumes that governance and location choice are independent from one another. This article tests the veracity of this assumption in the global semiconductor industry. We report evidence of significant correlations across choices regarding how to govern and where to locate production, evidence of a reciprocal relationship between governance and location choices, and evidence suggesting how interdependence between governance and location choices affects the stability of relationships highlighted by extant theories. We conclude with implications for future theoretical and empirical research based on the existence of these interdependent effects. Managerial Summary: Managers face difficult choices when deciding how to organize the performance of an activity. They must choose whether to outsource an activity by balancing the potential benefits of a supplier's lower costs or knowledge against the costs of diminished coordination and control. They must also choose where to perform an activity by considering the benefits of locally bound expertise as well as potential costs associated with cultural, legal, and social barriers. While prior research has often addressed these issues by assuming that these choices are independent, this paper demonstrates that governance and location choices are interdependent and that each choice reciprocally affects the other. It concludes by suggesting managers utilize an expanded governance-location choice set when evaluating where and how to manage their core activities. © 2021 Strategic Management Society.","economic organization; governance choice; interdependence; location choice; regression analysis (2SLS)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115807213

We studied the implications of such online word-of-mouth for consumer judgement and decision-making. The case used is organic food, which is the most successful among the currently emerging, sustainability-differentiated food product categories. We first analysed the online discussion on organic food by conducting a text-mining study of reader comments (N = 63,379) from the comments section of a major German online news outlet. Topics therein are discussed with differing frequency, thereby indicating the salience of the various issues to online readers and consumers. One organic food topic of high salience (animal welfare) and one of low salience (biodiversity) were selected to investigate the behavioural relevance of salient online topics in a subsequent priming experiment (online survey of German consumers; N = 1,118). In particular, we tested whether the relative online salience of the two topics used as primes influenced the likelihood of choosing organic instead of conventional eggs and milk in a choice experiment and the acceptance of policies supporting organic farming. Although ineffective for the choice of milk, the priming worked as hypothesized regarding the choice of eggs and policy acceptance. Priming the topic with high online salience is more effective at promoting pro-organic behaviour than priming the topic with low online salience. Priming effects also depended on prime strength, attitude strength and experience with buying organic food. We discuss how insights from text mining of online word-of-mouth can be employed to promote sustainable consumption behaviour. © 2021 The Authors.

They compare two types of VET systems. Collectivist systems have high employer involvement and focus on specific skills, whereas Statist systems have lower employer involvement and focus more on general skills. Based on prior research demonstrating the importance of general skills in learning new skills, the authors hypothesize that worker adaptability will be higher in Statist VET systems than in Collectivist VET systems. Using a triple-difference model on data from the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies, they find that as age increases, a significantly steeper decline in worker adaptability occurs within Collectivist systems compared to Statist systems. Results provide an explanation behind the diminishing employment returns to employer-dominated VET systems found in prior studies. © The Author(s) 2021.","comparative political economy; education; employment; human capital; occupational skill requirements; older workers; skill training; skill-biased technical change; training; worker skills",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107613075

Our current understanding of the roles that temporal shifts play in enabling organizational change is inconclusive in terms of when and how temporal shifts contribute to the success of organizational change. We exploit an in-depth case study of a new digitalized design approach implemented at Advanced Construction to demonstrate how a temporal shift can increase temporal awareness, among organizational members, of the salient and differing temporalities involved. In this case, the increased temporal awareness facilitated improved temporal coordination, which in turn figured prominently in making actual change possible. Our study identifies three complementary roles of change-inducing temporal shifts—namely, in connection with past experience, current activities, and future directions. Thus, we develop a deeper understanding of the relation between temporal shifts and organizational change, and offer a novel account of how the establishment of a temporal zone harbors those three roles of temporal shifts. © The Author(s) 2021.","case study; organizational change; temporal shifts; temporality; temporary organizations","article; awareness; organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102725771

Soccer is a glycogen consuming activity due to its high-intensity intermittent nature, and muscle glycogen is a key factor associated with fatigue late in a game, as well as in determining recovery after a game or an intense training session. Low glycogen in individual muscle fibers and subcellular compartments in the muscle cell is likely to negatively affect several essential steps in the excitation-contraction coupling such as action potential propagation, calcium handling and cross-bridge cycling through reductions in muscle ATP which are suggested sites of muscle function impairment inducing muscle fatigue. Recovery of physical performance and muscle glycogen after a soccer game is a slow process, which challenges the reality in modern elite soccer with increased game and training frequency and physiological loading. We suggest a markedly higher prioritization of fitness training modalities, nutritional approaches and general recovery strategies that optimizes muscle glycogen storage prior to games and training sessions. Also, the soccer community including the governing bodies of the sport must acknowledge and plan according to the high and increasing demands of the modern game, as well as the consequences this has on fatigue and recovery. These aspects are paramount to consider in the planning of training and games, as well as in the process of structuring soccer tournaments and developing competitive regulations in the future to optimize performance and player health.

It further discusses important potential strategies, which can be useful to overcome these challenges based on a conceptual review of extant research. Design/methodology/approach: The current paper undertakes a conceptual work where multiple streams of literature are integrated to present a rather holistic yet critical overview of the relationship between AI (particularly robots) and HRM in contemporary organisations. Findings: We highlight that interaction and collaboration between human workers and robots is visible in a range of industries and organisational functions, where both are working as team members. This gives rise to unique challenges for HRM function in contemporary organisations where they need to address workers' fear of working with AI, especially in relation to future job loss and difficult dynamics associated with building trust between human workers and AI-enabled robots as team members. Along with these, human workers' task fulfilment expectations with their AI-enabled robot colleagues need to be carefully communicated and managed by HRM staff to maintain the collaborative spirit, as well as future performance evaluations of employees. The authors found that organisational support mechanisms such as facilitating environment, training opportunities and ensuring a viable technological competence level before organising human workers in teams with robots are important. Finally, we found that one of the toughest challenges for HRM relates to performance evaluation in teams where both humans and AI (including robots) work side by side. We referred to the lack of existing frameworks to guide HRM managers in this concern and stressed the possibility of taking insights from the computer gaming literature, where performance evaluation models have been developed to analyse humans and AI interactions while keeping the context and limitations of both in view. Originality/value: Our paper is one of the few studies that go beyond a rather general or functional analysis of AI in the HRM context. It specifically focusses on the teamwork dimension, where human workers and AI-powered machines (robots) work together and offer insights and suggestions for such teams' smooth functioning. © 2021, Ahmad Arslan, Cary Cooper, Zaheer Khan, Ismail Golgeci and Imran Ali.","Artificial intelligence; e-HRM challenges; HRM strategies; Human–robot interaction; Teamwork",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111548576

Thereby, the purpose of the study is to cover the main contributors in the research field of hypercompetition and explore their findings and different views on hypercompetition. Design/methodology/approach: Systematically review 131 conceptual and empirical studies published or presented at a conference in the past 25 years, with the focus on the definitions, causes and consequences (or presumed effects) of hypercompetition. In the paper, I follow the well-known systematic literature review method by Tranfield et al. (2003). Findings: The contribution of the study is to advance the knowledge of researchers and managers, in such a way that it becomes easier for them to select relevant variables to measure hypercompetition and identify strategies for gaining temporary competitive advantages in hypercompetitive environments. The construct of hypercompetition required a consolidation of commonalities in the definitions and characteristics used by scholars, to ensure that proper assumptions and variables are being used to measure hypercompetition in future research. Several ways to measure the effects of hypercompetition on firms, industries and individuals have been proposed, but the field still lacks of a clear definition on how to directly measure the construct. Practical implications: In this paper, I highlight three managerial implications of hypercompetition as follows: action-based strategy, the determinants of hypercompetition and the importance for managers of accurately establishing their firm’s competitive situation. Originality/value: Previous reviews in the area have either focussed on specific components or effects of hypercompetition. The present study collectively takes into consideration the definitions, causes and consequences of hypercompetition on firms, industries and individuals.

Design/methodology/approach: The research draws on 10 semi-structured interviews and correspondence, with six English universities in the context of their relationship with three PABs to build an extended analytical structure to understand the nature and extent of the accreditation system in light of COVID-19. Findings: The study shows that COVID-19 has highlighted pedagogical and ideological conflicts within the PAB–university relationship. The analysis shows that, in an attempt to resolve these conflicts, universities demonstrate “unrequited love” for PABs by limiting changes to assessments to meet the PABs’ criteria. Indeed, PABs face very little resistance from universities. This further constrains academics by suppressing innovation and limiting their scope to learn and adopt new skills, habits and teaching styles. Originality/value: The paper highlights the weakness of the PAB–university relationship. Moreover, it shows that rather than using the pandemic crisis to question this relationship, PABs may seek to promote their accounting pedagogy and retain greater control of the accounting curriculum. This can entail the transformation of academics into translators of PABs’ accounting pedagogy rather than exercising academic freedom and promoting critical thinking. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accounting education; COVID-19; Crisis; Higher education; Pedagogy; Professional accounting bodies; UK higher education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117484355

Some authors have found RMS as an enabler for sustainable manufacturing, however, this needs further investigation. This paper aims through a literature review at describing and summarizing the hitherto conducted research on RMS and sustainability. A literature review in the database Scopus was carried out and a total of 265 papers were initially reviewed. Two categorizations of prominent papers were carried out: an initial categorization and a categorization according to the triple bottom line of sustainability.

The empirical data include 12 in-depth interviews as well as documents related to the revision process. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Findings: The paper identifies and discusses strategic dilemmas arising from incorporating digitalization into planning doctrine. Two major areas of concern are addressed. The first involves considerations about the extent of digitalization, including concerns about risk and issues of timing regarding choices of specific digital solutions. The second involves potential limits of digitalization in relation to military notions of the role and identity of the commander. The article suggests that digitalization may impact on professional roles and identities and that strategic knowledge management developers need to be cognizant of this.

Despite the recognized benefits of CE, the intended outcomes are not always achieved due to the occurrence of rebound effects. The lack of consideration of potential rebound effects triggered by CE is delaying the achievement of CE's full potential. This paper aims to further evolve the concept and mechanisms of circular rebound effects by means of a systematic literature review. In this context, this paper proposes a conceptual framework which brings together the main characteristics and mechanisms (incl. the initiating, developer, and mitigating mechanisms) of a rebound effect in the CE context. The four major lessons learned from research on the circular rebound effect were discussed, including its contextual dependencies, the need for new forms of governance, and how direct effects can overshadow the indirect effects of circularity, indicating a need for early-detection instruments. In addition to proposing six avenues of future research, the research provides clarification and a basis for integrating rebound effect concepts into the CE practice, with important implications for a successful CE transition. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Circular economy rebound; Rebound effect mechanisms; Unintended consequences","Circular economy; Circular economy rebound; Effect mechanism; Environmental performance; Rebound effect mechanism; Rebound-effect; Research agenda; Systematic literature review; Unintended consequences; Environmental management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125465757

Higher loads during everyday activities and exercise seems to be contraindicated with GT. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of exercise with low-loads concurrent partial blood flow restriction (LL-BFR) and patient education for patients present GT. Methods: Recruitment took place at three hospitals in the Central Denmark Region. The intervention consisted of daily sessions for 8 weeks with one weekly supervised session. From week three patients exercised with applied partial blood flow restriction by means of a pneumatic cuff around the proximal thigh of the affected leg. Throughout the intervention patients received patient education on their hip condition. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were collected at baseline. The feasibility of LL-BFR was conducted by adherence to the exercise protocol and drop-out rate. Patient reported outcome measures (The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Gluteal Questionnaire, EuroQol - 5 Dimensions-Visual Analogue Scale, Oxford Hip Score, Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score), maximal voluntary isometric hip abduction-, hip extension, and knee extension strength (Nm/kg) measured using a handheld dynamometer, and functional capacity tests (30 second chair-stand test and a stair-climb test) was conducted as secondary outcomes. Results: Sixteen women with a median (IQR) age of 51 (46–60) years were included. Median (IQR) Body Mass Index was 26.69 (23.59–30.46) kg/m2. Adherence to the total number of training sessions and the LL-BFR was 96.4 and 94.4%, respectively. Two patients dropped out due to (i) illness before initiation of LL-BFR and (ii) pain in the affected leg related to the LL-BFR-exercise. At follow-up both pain levels and patient-reported outcome measures improved. Isometric hip abduction-, hip extension-, and knee extension strength on both legs and functional performance increased. Conclusion: LL-BFR-exercise seems feasible for treatment of GT. At follow-up, a high adherence and low drop-out rate were observed. Further, patients reported clinically relevant reductions in pain, and showed significant increases in isometric hip and knee strength.

Design/methodology/approach: In total, the study uses 138 peer-reviewed articles on effectuation, causation, effectual/causal decision-making logics and related issues such as the impact of antecedent factors of international strategy (i.e. effectuation, causation and bricolage) on the international performance of the firm. Findings: Even though the theory of effectuation was formulated in 2001, to a large extent it has still not moved away from the realm of small entrepreneurial firms. The development of effectuation logic has accelerated in recent years, but the bulk of the research still focusses on small entrepreneurial firms rather than on the application of the theory in larger, non-entrepreneurial firms. Furthermore, effectuation theory would benefit from being developed into the realm of psychology and sociology. Originality/value: This study offers a conceptual model on how effectuation, causation and bricolage influence internationalisation strategy, which, in turn, impacts the international performance of the firm. Furthermore, the study discusses the effectual logic for larger firms. The exponential growth of studies on effectuation during recent years, i.e. 2017 to the first quarter of 2020, shows that researchers have responded to calls by leading authors stating that effectuation theory is a field with great potential for further theoretical developments.

Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test four hypotheses with survey data from 517 undergraduates in Turkey. Findings: Results show that service modularity affects the PU of e-learning programs through the PEoU. Service customization negatively moderates the effect of service modularity on the PEoU, but positively moderates the effect of the PEoU on the PU of e-learning programs. Practical implications: This study offers insights that support the decisions of policymakers and higher education institutions on how to design appealing e-learning programs cost-effectively. Social implications: This study reveals the determinants of the PU of e-learning, which could support the democratization of access to higher education in emerging countries where barriers to higher education are relatively greater than in developed countries. Originality/value: The concept of service modularity is explored in the e-learning context from the students' perspective. This study shows that the standardized interfaces across course modules increase the PU of e-learning programs by improving the ease of use. It also shows, interestingly, that service customization, enabled by modularity, is not always appreciated by service consumers, because of the potential extra effort demanded in communicating their unique needs to service providers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","e-learning; Emerging country; Higher education; Perceived usefulness; Service modularity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126289472

To solve the energy optimization problem in the time-varying smart grid, this paper proposes a multi-timescale EMS based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm and multi-neural-network fusion (MNNF) prediction technology. In detail, according to different power consumption characteristics, this paper uses fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithm to classify power users into industrial users, commercial users and residential users. Based on the classification results, an MNNF prediction method is proposed that can integrate different influencing factors to predict load consumption and renewable energy generation. Then a multi-timescale ADP optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the utilization of renewable energy on daily, intra-day and real-time (i.e., three timescales) of energy behavior. The convergence of the multi-timescale ADP algorithm is proved mathematically when the initial value is a random semi-positive definite function. Finally, the proposed ADP with MNNF energy management system is verified on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive dynamic programming; Energy management system; Hardware-in-loop; Multi-neural network fusion prediction algorithm","Clustering algorithms; Dynamic programming; Electric power transmission networks; Energy management; Forecasting; Functions; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Adaptive dynamic programming; Hardware in loop; Multi-neural network fusion prediction algorithm; Multi-neural networks; Neural network fusions; Prediction algorithms; Prediction methods; Renewable energy generation; Smart grid; Time-scales; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124076691

Design/methodology/approach: The authors apply a multi-temporal ethnography approach, including data from studies dating back to 2002. This enables us to scrutinize reconfigurations of processes of exclusion and inclusion in urban city life based on studies that in different ways feed into the broader picture of how socially marginalized citizens are included and excluded in urban space. Findings: The municipality of Aarhus sways between strategies of dispersion and exclusion and those of inclusion of marginalized citizens. Taken together, these strategies constitute a “messy middle ground” (May and Cloke, 2014) in responses to the street people rather than either clear-cut punitive or supportive strategies. Finally, we point to the limit of inclusion in more recent strategies aimed at including marginalized citizens in urban planning of a new, gentrifying neighbourhood. Originality/value: The article builds on studies that in critical engagement with the dominating focus on punitive or revanchist approaches to regulation of homeless citizens' presence in urban space have shown how such regulating practices are rarely punishing alone. We contribute to this literature by showing how seemingly contradictory attempts to exclude, disperse and include socially marginalized citizens in different urban settings are relational rather than in outright opposition. In continuation of this, we show how dispersal strategies both depend on and are legitimized by the promotion of alternative and more inclusive settings elsewhere. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dispersion; Gentrification; Homelessness; Social marginalization; Urban space",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124912071

In the present article, the authors focus on how we are to understand a locally sensitive organization of territorial cohesion in the Danish context. Traditional sociological concepts and standardized area-types used for administrative purposes have turned out not being very helpful in understanding the interrelation between inequality, urbanization and territorial cohesion. The authors argue for a processual and relational approach to urbanization. Design/methodology/approach: The present article is based on interview material and policy documents from three Danish case studies representing urban, suburban and rural forms of settlement. The case studies are part of a cross-European research project. Findings: The authors show how territorial governance play a key role in the strategies of densification/de-densification facilitating shielding capacities of collective efficacy, and reversely that bottom-up innovations are crucial for the ability of territorial governance to mobilize territorial capital and mediate in effects of territorial inequality.

Design/methodology/approach: The article is based on the two authors' participation in the academic workshop, as well as their continued engagement with the Gellerup estate through separate project employments and ethnographic research projects in the estate, consisting of both participant observation and interviews. Findings: In the article the authors suggest that the 2015 workshop reproduced particularly the category of idle urban young men as problematic. The authors analyze this as a form of “moral urban citizenship”. The article also analyzes some of the proposed solutions to the problem, particularly architectural transformations, and connects the Danish approach to the problems of the “ghetto” to urban developments historically and on a global scale. Originality/value: Cross-disciplinary academic attempts to solve real-world problems are rarely incorporated as ethnographic data.

Nevertheless, efforts often lead to rather decontextualized concepts and generic theories that are unable to bring together the complexities of applying entrepreneurship education to particular institutional logics and local pedagogical understandings. Based on a narrow and selective literature review, this study aims to identify and reconstruct how entrepreneurship education can adjust to the disciplines in which it unfolds. To contribute to transcending this dilemma, this article raises the following question: How can entrepreneurship education be understood in a differentiated manner and contextually reconstructed to the many disciplines and professions in which it unfolds? Design/methodology/approach: The study follows the general idea of an integrative literature review, meaning that a few references, in particular Jones' work on a signature pedagogy for entrepreneurship education, led to a deeper search of the older background literature from Shulman on the idea of a signature pedagogy for professions. Findings: The authors identify three existing notions (MK-0, MK-1 and MK-2) of signature pedagogy within entrepreneurship education and propose a fourth notion that combines the established understandings into a signature pedagogy, MK-3, in which entrepreneurship education should be adjusted to the disciplines in which it unfolds, by integrating and balancing general, disciplinary/professional and entrepreneurial purposes of education. Originality/value: Accepting that context matters to entrepreneurship education creates a need for understanding the contextual influence on pedagogies. The paper contributes by establishing a theory-based framework that can help educators formulate and balance general, professional and entrepreneurial purposes of education, depending on the particular context of their educational activities. Furthermore, the paper is a call to action for additional scholarship that identifies avenues for future research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Context; Entrepreneurship education; Professions; Purpose; Scholarship; Signature pedagogy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118470621

The importance of digital readiness for digital transformations has attracted increasing interest recently in this context. However, prior research has not addressed which specific aspects of digital readiness links to digital transformation outcomes under a given context. This study contributes to filling this gap in the literature. Using a sample of 207 Danish SMEs, we conduct an ordinal regression analysis to find out which dimension(s) of digital readiness are important to digital transformation outcomes for small companies. The results show that the strategy and technology dimensions have a positive impact on the dependent variables. The results further highlight the importance of a company’s capacity for change to deploy existing resources. Our results have strong implications for practitioners, as they provide guidance on what to focus on with respect to digital readiness at the outset of a firm’s digital transformation journey. © World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","capacity; digital readiness; Digital transformation; SMEs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135809048

However, it is unclear how outsourcing influences the public workforce, and little is known about the effect on employees who change from working for the government to working for the vendor receiving the outsourcing contract. In this article, we theoretically argue that the introduction of competition and private ownership in public service delivery may have negative consequences for employees' remuneration, employment, and health outcomes. We assess these arguments using unique individual-level register data of 1,478 Danish relatively low-skilled employees who changed job from public to private employment due to government outsourcing. Using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, we estimate the effect on employees' remuneration, employment and income transfers, and use of health services compared to an exact matched control group of public employees who did not experience outsourcing. Our findings suggest that outsourcing significantly decreased employee remuneration and employment and increased public income transfers, while the effect on health services use was marginal and transitory. Potential mechanisms explaining these findings include the vendor's incentive to reduce the workforce and increase productivity, the stress of changing jobs, and poorer person-environment fit. The results suggest that outsourcing has high costs for employees, some of which are passed on to the government itself through increased expenditure for public income transfers. We propose pathways for further theoretical and empirical research on employee consequences of government outsourcing. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Why do some bureaucrats engage in voice and guerrilla sabotage to thwart policies against the public interest under ""unprincipled principals,""yet others do not? Despite its centrality in contemporary governance, this conundrum has not seen quantitative research. We address this gap with survey evidence from 1,700 Brazilian public servants during the Temer Presidency, widely perceived to lack democratic legitimacy and integrity. We focus on one key explanator: public service motivation (PSM). We argue that bureaucrats with greater PSM are more likely to engage in voice and sabotage of ""unprincipled policies,""and exit to avoid implementing ""unprincipled policies.""Structural equation models support these hypotheses. Public service-motivated bureaucracies are thus short-run stalwarts against ""unprincipled""political principals.

Despite the amount of research that has been conducted on the prioritization process, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the underlying comparison. Drawing on insight from the street-level bureaucracy literature, this study suggests that the administrative grouping of citizens in public service agencies influences the comparison so that the allocation of public services not only depends on a citizen's need, but also on the needs of the other citizens assigned to the same agency. In a fixed effects analysis, based on registry data on more than 300,000 students, this study exploits the as-good-as-random assignment of students to classes within schools to analyze the influence of classroom composition on referrals to special education in Danish primary school. The result shows that students with better-performing peers are considerably more likely to be referred to special education than equally low-achieving students in lower-performing classes. This finding substantiates the argument of frame of reference effects in street-level bureaucracy and illustrates an unwarranted distributive consequence of the administrative grouping of citizens, thereby initiating a theoretical discussion of how such an influence can be mitigated. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

Method: The framework was developed using mixed methods over four phases, including i) a targeted literature review of KT networks, activities and indicators, ii) two scoping reviews to further enhance the set of indicators, iii) peer-reviews by international KT experts and an online expert consultation, and iv) piloting. Results: A comprehensive theory of change (ToC) and indicators, both for the Network Secretariat and its participating member countries, were identified to develop the monitoring and evaluation framework. The framework includes (i) a ToC, including three key indicator domains across the results chain (outputs, short term outcomes, intermediate outcomes), and (ii) indicators for the three key domains, that can be selected depending on the stage of network maturity, along with suggested data collection methods. The three key indicator domains are 1) KT capacity and skill building; 2) network (structure, governance and leadership); and 3) KT/evidence-informed policy value and culture.

We exploit merged nurse records and administrative data and use an event study design to compare the outcomes of families, who vary in the exact timing of their nurse visit around the recommended age for infant vaccinations. We find that a nurse visit prior to the recommended vaccination age increases parents’ probability of timely vaccination adherence. In the longer run, vaccination coverage rates between treated and control parents converge, and thus our findings suggest that nurses primarily act as human vaccination reminders. However, as our heterogeneity analyses show that a timely nurse visit positively affects vaccination coverage for inexperienced parents, adequately timed nurse visits may have the potential to also increase vaccination coverage. © 2022 The Author(s)","Administrative data; Denmark; Event study; Health behavior; Nurse home visiting; Vaccination adherence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125219917

This article suggests that the practice of industrial marketing itself should be (re)conceptualized as a Bayesian process of belief-updating that entails a continuous cognitive cycle of formulation of hypotheses (i.e., beliefs about the market) and the subsequent updating of those hypotheses through exposure to market evidence (e.g., data from the market). A Bayesian perspective on industrial marketing enables a synthesis of a broad body of extant research as well as a focus on the interconnection between executives' market beliefs (theories-in-use) and belief-updating (assessing the validity of those beliefs in view of market evidence). A view of industrial marketing as a Bayesian process not only enhances our understanding in general but also fosters insights into market learning in uncertain and volatile situations. A Bayesian conceptualization suggests a new understanding of industrial marketing that also informs a typology of marketing approaches.

However, Employer-to-Employer (EE) transitions are hard to measure in widely used matched employer-employee datasets such as those available in the US. We investigate how the lack of the exact start and end dates for job spells affect the level and cyclicality of EE transitions using Danish data containing daily information on employment relationships. Defining EE transitions based on quarterly data overestimates the EE transition rate by approximately 30% compared to daily data. The bias is procyclical and is reduced by more than 10% in recessions. We propose an algorithm that uses earnings and not just start and end dates of jobs to redefine EE transitions.

However, sparse, imbalanced check-in data and diverse user check-in patterns pose severe challenges for POI recommendation tasks. Knowledge-aware models are known to be primary in leveraging these problems. However, as most knowledge graphs are constructed statically, sequential information is yet integrated. In this work, we propose a meta-learned sequential-knowledge-aware recommender (Meta-SKR), which utilizes sequential, spatio-temporal, and social knowledge to recommend the next POI for a location-based social network user. The framework mainly contains four modules. First, in the graph construction module, a novel type of knowledge graph - the sequential knowledge graph, which is sensitive to the check-in order of POIs - is built to model users' check-in patterns. To deal with the problem of data sparsity, a meta-learning module based on latent embedding optimization is then introduced to generate user-conditioned parameters of the subsequent sequential-knowledge-aware embedding module, where representation vectors of entities (nodes) and relations (edges) are learned. In this embedding module, gated recurrent units are adapted to distill intra- and inter-sequential knowledge graph information. We also design a novel knowledge-aware attention mechanism to capture information surrounding a given node. Finally, POI recommendation is provided by inferring potential links of knowledge graphs in the prediction module. Evaluations on three real-world check-in datasets show that Meta-SKR can achieve high recommendation accuracy even with sparse data. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","knowledge graphs; meta-learning; POI recommendation","Graph embeddings; Knowledge management; Social networking (online); Check-in; Embeddings; Knowledge graphs; Location-based social networks; Meta-learning approach; Metalearning; Point of interest recommendation; Rapid growth; Sequential information; Spatio-temporal; Knowledge graph",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124092927

Contextual information is modeled using Dirichlet-Hawkes processes (DHP) and used in augmenting Web search queries. The context is captured by monitoring all naturally occurring user behavior using continuous 24/7 recordings of the screen and associating the context with the queries issued by the users. We report a field study in which 13 participants installed a screen recording and digital activity monitoring system on their laptops for 14 days, resulting in data on all Web search queries and the associated context data. A query augmentation (QAug) model was built to expand the original query with semantically related terms. The effects of context window and source were determined by training context models with temporally varying context windows and varying application sources. The context models were then utilized to re-rank the QAug model. We evaluate the context models by using the Web document rankings of the original query as a control condition compared against various experimental conditions: (1) a search context condition in which the context was sourced from search history; (2) a non-search context condition in which the context was sourced from all interactions excluding search history; (3) a comprehensive context condition in which the context was sourced from both search and non-search histories; and (4) an application-specific condition in which the context was sourced from interaction histories captured on a specific application type. Our results indicated that incorporating more contextual information significantly improved Web search rankings as measured by the positions of the documents on which users clicked in the search result pages. The effects and importance of different context windows and application sources, along with different query types are analyzed, and their impact on Web search performance is discussed. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","application source; context window; contextual information; digital user behavior; query augmentation; Web search","Behavioral research; Search engines; Websites; Application source; Condition; Context models; Context window; Contextual information; Digital user behavior; Query augmentations; Search history; User behaviors; Web searches; Information retrieval",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123900630

We then analyze the external governance effects of blockchain applications, including the direct impact of blockchain applications on firms’ collaborative innovation, and the indirect impact of blockchain applications on the relationship between social trust and corporate collaborative innovation. We find that blockchain application enhances collaborative innovation and strengthens the positive impact of social trust on collaborative innovation.

However, the impact of energy endowment on energy efficiency and the moderating effects of various environmental regulations have not yet been studied in an integrated framework. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by employing a system generalized method of moments (system GMM) for China with panel data of 30 provincial regions from 2008 to 2018. The results reveal varying energy efficiency among different provincial regions in China at a medium-to-low level and confirm the existence of resource curse at the national level since the impact of energy endowment on energy efficiency is significantly negative. Whereas market-based environmental regulations had a significantly positive moderating effect on the relationship between energy endowment and energy efficiency, this effect was insignificant for command-and-control environmental regulations. These findings provide empirical evidence to support the formulation of environmental regulations that will further improve energy efficiency and carbon neutrality in China. © 2022","Command-and-control environmental regulation; Energy efficiency; Energy endowment; Market-based environmental regulation; Moderating effect","Carbon; Commerce; Environmental regulations; Method of moments; Carbon neutralities; Command and control; Command-and-control environmental regulation; Energy; Energy endowment; Energy transformation; Environmental energy; Low carbon energies; Market-based environmental regulation; Moderating effect; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy management; energy planning; environmental policy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123372206

By conceptualizing cooperative resilience according to cooperatives’ dual objectives of economic and social viability, we build an empirically grounded framework that encompasses social capital-driven mechanisms that underlie cooperative resilience. Economically, strengthening social capital (channeling) may result in organizational transparency and collaborative work, while widening social networks (targeting) develops velocity and flexibility. Socially, both mechanisms lead to the emergence of individual-level resilience capabilities.

While scholars have started to examine the influence of digitalization on various business model elements, they have so far paid little attention to its implications on the external relationships in which firms engage for value creation. Building on a qualitative analysis of seventeen interviews, this study develops a two-stage framework for the transition to digital business models. In Stage 1, retailers collaborate with specialized service providers to implement a digital business model. As firms from the retail ecosystem collaborate with firms from the digital-service ecosystem to create a value proposition for end-customers, a meta-ecosystem emerges. In Stage 2, firms (retailers) seek to differentiate themselves from their competitors in the meta-ecosystem. Physical interactions with the digital service providers, the product suppliers, and the customers are a primary means towards this end.

Using a time-lagged two-wave survey of 227 manufacturing SMEs, we tested our proposed hypotheses using structural equational modeling (SEM). Our results reveal that digital platform capability is positively associated with the agility of SMEs and that all three intellectual capital dimensions (i.e., human, organizational, and relational capital) mediate this relationship. We also found that environmental dynamism has a negative moderating role on digital platform capability and intellectual capital. Environmental dynamism curbs SMEs’ abilities to turn their digital platform capabilities into increased intellectual capital. Our results shed light on the importance of intellectual capital in creating improved organizational agility for manufacturing SMEs through digital platform capability within the boundary conditions of environmental dynamism. © 2022","Digital platform capability (DPC); Environmental dynamism (ED); Intellectual capital (IC); Manufacturing SMEs; Organizational agility (OA)","Integrated circuits; Knowledge management; Digital platform capability; Digital platforms; Environmental dynamism; Environmental dynamisms; Intellectual capital; Manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprise; Organizational agility; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Manufacture; capital; manufacturing; small and medium-sized enterprise; social change; structural change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122975350

We reason that offshoring decisions send unintended signals about job insecurity to companies’ onshore labor markets. This signaling effect implies that offshoring companies must pay higher salaries for new hires than non-offshoring companies. We tested our predictions on a sample of 7971 matched managers and professionals recently hired by offshoring and non-offshoring companies. Our results indicate a 3–7% wage penalty for offshoring companies. Thus, we conclude that not only is offshoring challenging to implement, but it can also entail a number of general ramifications for the domestic labor market. © 2021, Academy of International Business.","hidden costs; hiring; offshoring; signaling theory; wage penalty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122850129

Additionally, we posit that skeptical language embedded in a firm's decision aid will induce a skeptical attitude, which we measure in terms of auditors' beliefs and feelings (i.e., confidence and concern) associated with the reasonableness of management's estimate. We find that the skeptical language prime has a positive effect on the quality of auditors' cognitive processing and reasonableness judgments. We also find that the skeptical language keeps auditors' feelings of concern high as opposed to conventional language, which resulted in auditors feeling less concerned.

The rising incidence and global predictions are alarming since a HF is a major, and potentially fatal, trauma to the citizen, requiring acute surgery, a multimodal approach and post-operative crosssectoral rehabilitation. However, continuity of the rehabilitation program is frequently interrupted in the transition between sectors, compromising optimal recovery of frail citizens. Thus, there is a need to develop and implement optimized cross-sectoral rehabilitation after HF. The purpose of this explorative study was to develop, implement and evaluate an optimized cross-sectoral rehabilitation program (OCRP) after HF surgery using validated theoretical frameworks. OCRP was developed, implemented and evaluated in one municipality using a pragmatic user-centered approach, quantitative and qualitative data collection and theoretical frameworks including the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) and RE-AIM.

To do this, we invited community members to share their experiences of working with Mark. The resulting narratives remember Mark as a co-author, co-researcher, project manager, conference organizer, research leader, PhD supervisor, and much more. The memories cover many different aspects of Mark’s academic spectrum: from evaluation to research methods to cross-cultural management, to dynamic capabilities, naming but a few. This space for remembrance however developed into a space of reflection and conceptualization. Inspired by the range and extent of Mark’s interests, skills, experiences, and personal qualities, this essay became conceptual as well as personal as we turned the spotlight on academic careers and consider alternative paths for Management Learning scholarship today. Using the collective representations of Mark’s career as a starting point, we develop, the concept of holistic scholarship, which embraces certain attitudes and orientations in navigating the dialectical spaces and transcending tensions in academic life. We reflect on how such holistic scholarship can be practised in our contemporary and challenging times and what inspiration and lessons we can draw from Mark’s legacy. © The Author(s) 2021.","Academic holism; holistic scholarship; management learning; organizational learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117341620

We provide this foundation by showing how Mintzberg’s critique of planning and design at the level of organizational strategy is in key ways anticipated by F.A. Hayek’s critique of planning and design at the societal level. Both writers are critical of rationalist epistemology and instead stress experiential knowledge, fallibility, and unanticipated social consequences. Hayek also extends Mintzberg’s work by showing how rules in the firm capture adaptive, experiential, tacit, and dispersed knowledge in the context of dynamic environments. A framework of rules thus creates inimitable and non-substitutable resources that enable the firm to fully exploit its competitive advantage. © The Author(s) 2021.","design school; dispersed knowledge; emergent strategy; F.A.

To explore individual heterogeneity, we adopt the componential theory of creativity, which links heterogeneous features of individuals to creativity performance. We propose that these features shape individuals’ responses to unit-level practices, stimulating international knowledge sourcing and sharing. We further acknowledge that MNE units are subject to the pressures for global integration and local adaptation. Individuals’ responses to unit-level knowledge transfer practices may be inconsistent with one or both of these pressures. We explore, in a nuanced fashion, conditions that can lead to such inconsistencies, and investigate how they can be resolved at the unit level to ensure effective knowledge sourcing by the MNE. Ultimately, our model challenges the assumption that individual knowledge-related efforts automatically accrue to the MNE level. We argue that effective knowledge sourcing by the MNE is the result of successful unit-level processes in managing individual heterogeneity and ensuring consistency with global integration and local adaptation pressures. Our multi-level model contributes to both the MNE- and individual-level perspective on international knowledge sourcing, and the growing microfoundations research on the role of the individual in an MNE. © 2021, Academy of International Business.","componential theory of creativity; international knowledge sourcing; microfoundations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107414438

This study employs conversation analysis to empirically explore peer interactions in a leadership development programme for first-line managers in the public sector in Denmark. The analysis shows that a socio-moral order, that is normative expectations inherent in interactions, guide peer discussions and shape the conditions for reflection and deeper reflexivity. The socio-moral order was based on a central principle of treating each other as experts on one’s own practice. This principle allowed for reflection but turned attention away from critical reflexive practices. As a result, peer discussions took a more conservative rather than a transformational orientation. The study extends the theoretical understanding of the conditions for critical reflexivity as it demonstrates how the socio-moral order of interaction regulates engagement in critically reflexive practices. © The Author(s) 2021.","Conversation; conversation analysis; leadership development; management development; peer interaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102807954

It shows an organization logic protecting corporate practices seen as ‘normal’ from a perceived disruption that employing highly skilled migrants could possibly cause.

We use Garrett et al.’s (J Bus Ethics 8(7):507–520, 1989) framework of neutralization techniques consisting of denial, justification, concession and excuse to examine the responses. During our QCA, we observed emerging themes around self-promotion and evasive tactics. We contribute to existing literature by proposing ‘evasion’ as a novel neutralization technique, particularly in circumstances of corporate responses to accusations of wrongdoing. We argue that evasion occurs when firms refuse to engage in the debate brought forward in an accusation. In addition, we enrich our understanding of neutralization techniques by proposing subneutralization techniques in our analysis to diverge from that of other studies.

To explore this phenomenon, we conduct a large-scale, empirical study of the emergence of the chief digital officer position, potential variations of this role, and the conditions under which firms choose to have this position. Our exploratory analysis of all firms in the S&P 1500 index between 2000 and 2018 offers unique insights. In descriptive terms, we find that chief digital officers did not appear until 2003 and their prevalence has increased notably since 2010. In addition, an analysis of these executives' titles and role descriptions alludes to two conceptually different types of chief digital officers: generalists and domain specialists. In prescriptive terms, we reveal several factors related to firms’ performance, strategic leadership, task demands, task environments, and mimicry behavior that influence the likelihood of chief digital officer presence. The combined empirical insights call for nuanced theoretical explanations of the chief digital officer phenomenon. Our study informs research on chief digital officers and functional executives in general. More generally, it provides a window into the larger issue of the microfoundations of digital transformation and strategic change in large firms, and it points to new strategy actors and practices. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chief digital officer; Digital transformation; Functional executive; Strategy actors","Finance; Digital transformation; Empirical studies; Exploratory analysis; Micro-foundations; Potential variations; Strategic changes; Strategic leadership; Task environment; Enterprise resource planning; conceptual framework; digitization; empirical analysis; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087978522

A total of 567 tests obtained from the daily training environment were analyzed in 41 elite female athletes (non-injured control: n = 30, ACLR: n = 17), including n = 6 athletes with pre-injury data, between 16 and 32 years of age from alpine ski racing (n = 32) and skier cross (n = 9). Bilateral CMJ testing was conducted on a dual force plate system, and the limb-specific vertical ground reaction force (Fz) was analyzed to obtain the net eccentric deceleration impulse (Ecc), lower limb stiffness (Stiff), maximal vertical jump height (JH), peak external mechanical power (PP) exerted on the body center of mass (BCM), modified-reactive-strength-index (RSImod), and the loss in BCM velocity during the final phase of the takeoff Δ(Vmax–Vtakeoff). Eccentric and concentric phase-specific between-limb asymmetry indexes (AIs) were also calculated. Additive mixed effects models (AMMs) were used to compare the age-dependent and post-injury time course change between groups. The mean values for non-injured controls >25 years of age were used as a comparative benchmark for recovery given the absence of pre-injury data. Net eccentric deceleration impulse increased and Δ(Vmax–Vtakeoff) decreased with age for the non-injured control group (p < 0.001) while between-limb AI (mean ± SD) fell between 1 ± 5% for the concentric phase and 3 ± 7% for the eccentric deceleration phase. Between-limb asymmetry became smaller in ACLR skiers with time-from-surgery to reach non-injured control values by 2 years, but SSC function, such as JH and PP, remained depressed up to 5 years post-surgery (p < 0.01), indicating impairments in SSC function. This highlights the importance of evaluating SSC performance capacity alongside vertical jump force-time asymmetries in female ACLR alpine skiers.

The Maersk case offers hard evidence of the value of RPA that can be used as a benchmark for decision-making in companies and as a basis for further research in key areas such as change management and behavioral aspects as well as return on investment on RPA and the need for RPA capability development. Design/methodology/approach: Together with the co-author from Maersk, the authors cover a multiple year RPA program in procurements, to capture lessons learned and develop research questions for the future. The authors consider 39 generic action principles for RPA adoption in a specific procurement context. Findings: The authors find RPA for procurement to be an enabler of strategic progress and of advancing the concept of triple values (enterprise, customer and employee) in a supply chain setting. The authors offer RPA adoption scoping guidance and show how, with growth and maturity of the program, conditions such as predictability of volume become less relevant as a scoping criterium. The authors also find that RPA augments work rather than replace staff. Maersk utilizes staff time freed up by automation to focus employees on more strategic priorities. The authors consider 39 generic action principles for RPA adoption in a procurement-specific context and develop additional action principles based upon the Maersk case. Originality/value: The authors study both a unique and rich case to complement limited empirical research on RPA in procurement and supply chain management and the limited research into RPA past early stage adoptions. The authors address Hofmann et al.'s (2019) questions about the change management involved in RPA and consider generic RPA action principles from literature in this specific procurement setting.

Drawing on Mariana Mazzucato's concept of the entrepreneurial state, this article investigates the role of the public sector in the development of the Danish robotics cluster, a world-leading cluster for production of industrial robots that has developed after the closing of Maersk's shipyard in the city of Odense. In what ways did public programs and actors contribute to the development of this cluster? In what ways did public programs facilitate entrepreneurs, and when did they function as agents or perhaps even risk-Takers? To answer these questions, this article tracks three layers of public agency: The local, the national, and the European. This article concludes that there were crucial initiatives at all three levels and that these initiatives were not coordinated, but nevertheless connected by a certain zeitgeist-the idea of public institutions taking responsibility for the competitiveness of private companies, an idea that blossomed in the period of high globalization from the late 1980s to the 2000s. In other words, what united the efforts of the public sector was not any master plan but an underlying thought collective that made the workings of the entrepreneurial state flexible and fit for the unpredictable nature of innovation. Thus, this article argues that industrial policy did not wither away in the age of neoliberalism but changed its form in an increasing complexity of state-market relations. ©","Denmark; Industrial clusters; Robotics Industry; The entrepreneurial state",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124753965

At the same time, many call for the prioritization of high-skilled immigration as they believe low-skilled entrepreneurs are not particularly innovative or high-growth-oriented. The purpose of this study is to critically review and synthesize the current literature on immigrant self-employment, paying particular attention to low-skilled immigrant entrepreneurship and the popular policy recommendation that high-skilled immigrants should be prioritized. Design/methodology/approach: The authors survey the existing literature on immigrant self-employment and discuss recurring data issues, how those issues have or have not been addressed, as well as how these data issues impact the validity of policy recommendations that favor high-skilled immigrants and disfavor low-skilled immigrants. In particular, the authors examine how length of stay in the host country and host country institutions impact immigrant self-employment, especially low-skilled immigrant self-employment. The authors also point out unintended consequences of low-skilled immigration. Findings: The authors find data issues significantly impact the potential justifications behind calls to favor high-skilled immigrants. In particular, many researchers underestimate the positive impacts of low-skilled immigrant self-employment by not accounting for institutions and length of stay in the host country. The authors conclude with policy recommendations that prioritize high-skilled immigration should be re-examined in light of recurring omitted variable biases within previous studies and evidence of a number of positive unintended consequences associated with low-skilled migration. Originality/value: The authors review current literature and discuss how important confounding variables, like the number of years an immigrant entrepreneur has lived in a host country and the institutions of a host country, make common policy recommendations suggesting prioritization of high-skilled immigration problematic.

The hourly variation of performance, economic, and environmental metrics is evaluated to investigate the proposed system's feasibility for a case study building in India. The effect of significant operational parameters on the system's performance is assessed by observing their influence on levelized cost of energy, biomass effectiveness, solar and biomass heat load ratios, and levelized carbon dioxide emission. The optimum design and operating conditions are ascertained through a genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization approach contemplating techno-economic-environmental facets to be satisfied simultaneously. According to the results, the highest monthly heat and electricity produced by the CPVT system are 521.8 kWh and 593.4 kWh in May. The results further reveal that sugarcane baggas is an excellent option compared to the most commonly used biomass in India because of the lowest price sensitivity. The parametric study results show that increasing the generator temperature leads to a favorable techno-environmental condition. Besides, the results reveal that the increase in solar panels is not economically suitable due to a higher levelized cost of energy. The optimization outcomes demonstrate that the optimum values of levelized cost of energy, biomass effectiveness, and levelized carbon dioxide emission are 58.1 USD/MWh, 3342.3 MWh, and 233.6 kg/MWh, respectively. Eventually, it can be observed that the chiller size and mass flow rate entering the CPVT panels are sensitive parameters and the optimum range of the generator temperature is between 91 °C and 95 °C. © 2022","Biomass-driven heater; Building cooling and power sysem; Concentrated photovoltaic thermal; Genetic algorithm approach; Techno-economic-environmental analysis","Absorption cooling; Architectural design; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Genetic algorithms; Global warming; Heat storage; Refrigerators; Structural design; Biomass-driven heater; Building cooling; Building cooling and power sysem; Concentrated photovoltaic thermal; Environmental analysis; Genetic algorithm approach; Photovoltaic thermals; Power sysem; Techno-economic-environmental analyse; Techno-economics; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124259496

In this sense, Nature-based Solutions (“green” technologies) coupled with advanced technologies (“grey” technologies) constitute a promising approach for fomenting onsite water treatment and reuse in cities, while also providing multiple co-benefits. This article puts forward a conceptual advancement by providing a better understanding of coupled “green-grey”/“grey-green” technologies (CGGT). To do this, we critically discuss the main reasons for pairing these technologies instead of using them separately, as well as their treatment performance and constraints regarding data reporting issues. Moreover, the article discloses the most common treatment configurations, water quality parameters being evaluated, potential reuse schemes, costs, and energy requirements. A systematic selection and analysis of scientific articles was carried out to this end. Of 395 pre-selected articles, only 17 addressed coupled (green-grey/grey-green) technologies in the treatment of urban wastewaters for further reuse or safe discharge onsite. Despite the relatively low number of articles, 80% were published in the past five years, showing the increased interest in this novel topic. The selected articles were analysed and here we present the resulting comprehensive Excel database (343 datasets) containing detailed information about the design, operation, and performance of such systems. Green-grey technologies were found to be predominant, the configuration constructed wetlands followed by advanced oxidation process and electrochemical process being the most studied. Grey technologies are normally applied at a second stage to remove pathogens in compliance with reuse standards (normally when green technologies alone cannot deliver the standards). Meanwhile, green technologies are commonly used at a second stage to break down slowly biodegradable substances that have not been completely removed by grey technologies (normally as a polishing step following grey technology). The design parameters for combining these technologies have not yet been fully optimized, since they were mainly designed as sole technologies and forcibly put together as a coupled treatment. Hence, further studies should focus on variables and parameters influencing the functioning of coupled technologies as a whole. Finally, due to the novelty and relevance of the topic, transparency and consistency in data reporting is essential to support the optimization and competitiveness of coupled green-grey/grey-green technologies against existing decentralized/centralized approaches. © 2022 The Authors","Advanced treatments; Combined technologies; Hybrid; Joined technologies; Reclaimed wastewater; Urban","Effluents; Quality control; Regulatory compliance; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water quality; Wetlands; Advanced treatment; Combined technology; Decentralised; Green technology; Hybrid; Joined technology; Reclaimed wastewater; Reuse; Urban; Water reuse; Wastewater reclamation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124246139

Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the author reflects and debates the inspiration that Michael Power’s book The Audit Society had on the author’s own research. Findings: The author finds that this book had a significant influence on how he succeeded theorizing his studies on auditing, and how he could contribute to the audit literature. It is stunning how the book succeeded in synthesizing audit research, encouraging scholars to understand auditing as a social practice, i.e. how auditing can be theorized using various social science theories and how the book also appealed to broader social science. Research limitations/implications: This paper is a reflection that covers around a 20-year period with potential mis-representations of how exactly sequences of actions and thoughts were. Practical implications: This paper helps to clarify how it is that audit operates and influences everyday life of persons involved with auditing. Social implications: This paper casts doubts as to what actions are carried out in the name of audit and that audit is not just a value free activity but involved with political agendas.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative descriptive design was used for this study. Nineteen commuting nurses were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling and interviewed over the telephone. The interviews were analyzed using a manifest and latent content analysis. Findings: The findings showed how the participating nurses' motivations to work in the capital region far away from their home were grounded in reaching the unique opportunity for work as a part of the unique organizational conditions, the unique positions and the unique work environment. The analysis showed how the nurses believed in better possibilities for themselves regarding opportunities for careers, specialized positions, development and education, as well as a lower hierarchy in management. Research limitations/implications: Studies of commuting among nurses are sparsely investigated in the literature and especially through the lens of motivation. The few existing studies report on cross-sectional data, and to the authors’ knowledge, no studies have been investigated using a qualitative design. For future research, it would therefore be relevant to investigate nurses' motivation to commute to work in other countries in a larger sample and perhaps with larger commuting distances. This could contribute to a broader and more nuanced understanding of the factors that motivate nurses to commute long distances to work, not just nationally but also internationally. Practical implications: The authors have conceptualized which factors most affect nurses' motivation to commute to work from a rural to more populous capital region in Figure 2. Here, the findings of the study are presented alongside the two theoretical perspectives used to frame the study. The figure can be used as a benchmark for organizational leaders who are interested in recruitment and retention of nurses, and in particular whether they are interested in the specific factors affecting nurses' motivation to commute to work. Based on the study findings, the authors suggest that rural hospital organizations can benefit from focusing on building their reputation and including what factors make them unique and desirable. However, this is a balancing act for organizational leaders, as they must deliver on promises made to nurses when they are engaged in recruitment. If they fail to do so, as indicated in the findings, nurses are likely to leave the organization for other job opportunities. Originality/value: This study contributes to new knowledge on why nurses decide to commute to work from rural areas to more populated areas. Looking at the nurses' reasons and perspective for commuting, the authors must acknowledge the difficulties in retaining nurses in rural regions. From a recruitment and retention perspective, nurse employers in rural regions must increase their offerings of unique work opportunities, including maintaining competitive pay and offering career, development and educational opportunities. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee turnover; Motivation; Qualitative research; Recruitment; Retention; Work analysis; Work values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122196872

Design/methodology/approach: This study traces the lifecycles of the following fads in practitioner-oriented and academic journals over more than 50 years: balanced scorecard, business process reengineering, design thinking, knowledge management, learning organization, management by objectives (MBO), matrix organization and total quality management (TQM). Findings: Contrary to the academic–practitioner gap lamented in the literature, this study indicates no such gap regarding these fads in general, but finds differences in the intensity with which the fads are dealt with. The two communities stimulate, sustain and abandon fads collectively, as the lifecycles of most of the fads were found to mirror each other in both communities.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a one-year ethnography of how employees achieve to qualify their work as “good work” in situations with several and sometimes conflicting ideals of what “good work” is. Fieldwork material was collected by following casework activities across organizational boundaries. By combining accounting literature on hybridization with literature on practices of valuation, the paper develops a novel theoretical framework which allows for analyses of the various practices of valuation, when and where they clash and how they persist over time in everyday work. Findings: Throughout the study, four distinct registers of valuation were identified: feeling, theorizing, formalizing and costing. To denote the meticulous efforts of pursuing good work in all four registers of valuation, the authors propose the notion of sequencing. Sequencing is an ongoing process of moving conflicting registers away from each other and bringing them back together again. Correspondingly, at the operational level of a hybrid organization, temporary compartmentalization is a means of avoiding clashes, and in doing so, making it possible for different and sometimes conflicting ways of achieving good results to continuously hybridize and persist together. Research limitations/implications: The single-case approach allows for analytical depth, but limits the findings to theoretical, rather than empirical, generalizability. The framework the authors propose, however, is well-suited for mobilization and potential elaboration in further empirical contexts. Originality/value: The paper provides a novel theoretical framework as well as rich empirical material from the highly political field of child protection work, which has seldomly been studied within accounting research. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethnography; Hybridization; Performance evaluation; Social services; Valuation practices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108641056

For games with discounted payoff, the result is known to hold for a specific class of games-essentially generalizations of Prisoner's Dilemma-but until now, no necessary and sufficient condition is known. To be of any value, the computable strategy having no computable best response must be part of a subgame-perfect equilibrium, as otherwise a rational, self-interested player would not play the strategy.We give the first necessary and sufficient conditions for a two-player repeated game to have such a computable strategy with no computable best response for all discount factors above some threshold. The conditions involve existence of a Nash equilibrium of the repeated game whose discounted payoffs satisfy certain conditions involving the min-max payoffs of the underlying stage game.

However, this transformation is complex because it requires companies to rethink and redesign their supply chains by considering the involvement of new stakeholders, the introduction of waste and their impact on product development, economic investments, and technological resources. As a result, companies need innovative modelling tools able to capture, investigate, and quantify the results of these changes and to work on the strategic planning, design, implementation, and management of their industrial symbiosis networks. This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate the most used modelling approaches to analyse industrial symbiosis, and to research their characteristics in terms of simulation methods, interaction mechanisms, and simulations software. Findings from our research suggest that an Agent-Based System Dynamics hybrid approach is an appropriate method for industrial symbiosis design and analysis. The paper also presents a theoretical framework that aims at supporting researchers and practitioners approaching industrial symbiosis and, in conclusion, a research agenda is suggested for scholars. © 2021 The Authors","Agent-based modelling; Hybrid modelling and simulation approach; Industrial symbiosis; Literature review; Research agenda; System dynamics",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127439319

In this editorial and the five articles comprising this special issue, not only are the challenges to such an endeavor explored, but also the achievements in the present and emerging imaginaries of organizing solidarity beyond an exploitative understanding of difference. The perspectives this special issue brings together include re-centering the Eurocentric concepts of organizing and solidarity, solidarity in research, solidarity as affective practice as well as the political and socio-economic relations that frame them. In addition to promoting an understanding of subjectivity shaped by power relations embedded in multiple social experiences, the articles in this special issue elaborate on solidarity in difference rather than a benevolent solidarity with difference and contribute, accordingly, to an understanding of organizing solidarity that starts from principles of radical interdependence, mutual recognition, and universal participation. Without neglecting the pitfalls and obstacles to organizing solidarity, this special issue hopefully sparks new debates on and informs new practices of solidarity in difference as there cannot be one single way to achieve this. © The Author(s) 2022.","alternative organizing; critical diversity; difference; solidarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127303556

(2011) is essentially the first study that explores the in-sample predictive impact of the price of crude oil on the U.S. industrial production index. To date, almost nothing is known about the nature and degree of the out-of-sample predictive impact of the price of crude oil on the U.S. industrial production index. This study fills the gap. Using various nonlinear transformations of the price crude oil widely employed in the crude oil price/GDP predictability literature as well as crude oil price volatility measures, we document (rather surprisingly) that the form of nonlinearity that delivers the most consistent pattern of out-of-sample population-level predictability gains relative to the benchmark when forecasting ex-post revised as well as real-time U.S. industrial production has to do with crude oil price decreases below the minimum price in recent memory. In contrast to the GDP predictability literature, crude oil price increases beyond the maximum in recent memory do not afford any predictive power. On the contrary, they deteriorate relative forecast performance. These results go directly against a distinct sense of déjà vu that one would expect given the degree of affinity between industrial production and GDP. The predictive power afforded by crude oil price net decreases also translate into economic gains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Crude oil price; Nonlinearity; Out-of-sample population-level predictability; Realized volatility; U.S. industrial production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127224407

We detail a bottom-up approach to scenario development for tourism, with local stakeholders developing local scenarios within the boundaries provided by the locally extended Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), widely used in climate research. As a demonstration of the approach, a group of invited stakeholders developed locally extended scenario narratives and the adaptation plans for blue tourism for coastal areas surrounding the Helsinki metropolitan area in Finland. The co-creation process yielded several recommendations for immediate action concerning protection of the coastal environments, land use planning, internal communication with the sector and coordinated monitoring of economic, ecological, social and cultural sustainability indicators.

Using factor analysis, a composite index of entrepreneurial ecosystem is constructed. The empirical results reveal that institutional transparency catalyzes the positive effect of entrepreneurial ecosystem index on the start-ups. Nevertheless, when the individual effects of entrepreneurial ecosystem’s elements on start-ups are analyzed, the composite index of institutional transparency reveals to be non-linearly related with the output of the entrepreneurial ecosystem, denoting a negative coefficient, in the linear form, and a positive coefficient, in the quadratic form. In addition, increases in financial and economic transparency and the transparency in urban planning deter the new business formation in a municipality, whereas the municipalities where public procurement is relatively transparent are found to be attracting more start-ups. Results also suggest that by increasing the transparency in public procurement, the government can raise the number of start-ups in a municipality. The empirical findings also corroborate the thesis that the presence of higher education institutions in a municipality help to attract more start-ups. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Eurasia Business and Economics Society.","Entrepreneurial ecosystem; Public procurement; Start-ups; Transparency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125491333

Dual cycling, in which loading and discharging processes are carried out simultaneously, achieves this goal by reducing the turnaround time of vessels in port and thus the CO2 output of handling equipment in port and fuel consumption through slow steaming at sea. Optimizing the dual cycling operations on RoRo vessels has not yet been investigated in the literature. This paper presents the novel RoRo dual cycling problem (RRDCP), and formulates it using integer programming (IP) with the objective to minimize the total makespan of discharging and loading operations. We further prove that the RRDCP is NP-complete by a reduction from a general machine scheduling problem, and introduce a novel heuristic to solve the problem called a generalized random key algorithm (GRKA). We evaluate the IP model and GRKA approach on both generated and industrial instances, showing that the GRKA heuristic finds optimal or near-optimal solutions to real-world problems in just seconds. We provide managerial insights on industrial instances, which indicate that our approach leads to a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of up to 25% for RoRo operations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dual cycling; RoRo shipping; Scheduling complexity","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; fuel consumption; shipping; vessel; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125482543

Projected climate change impacts will aggravate water availability, as well as flood risks, especially in urban areas. Nature-based solutions (NBS) have been identified as key concepts to defuse the expected tensions within the Water-Energy-Food (W-E-F) nexus due to their multiple benefits. In this paper, the authors outlined the theories and concepts, analyzed real-life case studies, and discussed the potential of NBS to address the future W-E-F nexus. For this purpose, we performed a systematic literature review on the theories of NBS that address the W-E-F nexus, and we summarized 19 representative real-life case studies to identify the current knowledge gaps and challenges. The quantitative and qualitative data was used to differentiate and discuss the direct and indirect potential benefits of NBS to the W-E-F nexus. The study further expanded on the challenges for the implementation of NBS and highlighted the growing possibilities in the context of circularity and the implementation of NBS in urban planning. It was concluded that the potential impacts of NBS on the W-E-F nexus have been identified, but the quantitative effects have not been analyzed in-depth.

Although short-term, face-to-face interactions can offer cost-savings by reducing the sales cycle length or by developing closer ties with strategic partners, questions remain regarding firms’ expectations of TS participation. For example, what are the drivers of business-to-business (B2B) TS participation and total investment? This four-study research evaluates the total investment of prospective exhibitors in relation to the rationale for exhibiting at a TS and adopts the organizer's view as the main interpretative lens. The data analysis entails Tobit modeling, replication, and difference-in-differences modeling. The results suggest that exhibitor participation is related to performance expectations. By incorporating the means-end theory, this study examines the role of intangible long-term expectations (image-building, relationship-building, motivation-enhancing) versus tangible short-term expectations (sales-related, information-gathering) in determining TS investment (as a proxy of perceived value). © 2022 The Author(s)","Difference-in-differences; Field experiment; Marketing budget; Means-end theory; Tobit model; Trade shows",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123632427

The focus of the present analytical endeavour is on the dissemination of knowledge of academics from the domain of business and management to professionals and other non-academic communicative partners in the context of the Harvard Business Review journal. The central empirical material is constituted by a cluster of videos selected from the Facebook context of the journal whose intention is to function as a bridge between academia and enterprises. For this bridging effort, a number of video genres which are not traditionally used for scientific knowledge communication in academic contexts (e.g., Quick Study, Explainers, Tips & Ideas, etc.) are employed. Furthermore, in accordance with the Facebook context, the videos are accompanied by users’ commentaries that evaluate the knowledge provided or/and contribute to communicating and co-constructing new knowledge. Finally, we include the articles, books and special issues to which the videos refer in the empirical study. This hybrid knowledge-communication setting is studied from a multimodal perspective in order to address the new ways in which semiotic modes and sub-modes enter into a meaning-making interplay at the level of each video and when users comment on the respective videos. The main analytical tools are the concepts of knowledge expansion and knowledge enhancement that characterize the interaction of modes in the knowledge-building process. Across the video genres that have been investigated, we see a tendency towards engaging users of the videos through diminishing the distance to the viewers. As a consequence, the videos have a high number of views, but at the same time there are few comments and hardly any comments engaging in mutual knowledge building. This paradox is discussed in more detail in the concluding section. © 2022 by the authors.

By drawing on organizational institutional theory, the article proposes that site-specific institutionalized norms can structure the nature and extent of business power. The article illustrates the value of this perspective through an illustrative case study of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) through interviews and participant observation of on-site dynamics during negotiations on environmental shipping regulation. The article shows how, in the case of the IMO, specific institutionalized norms and beliefs structure private actors’ possible influence and their claims to authority. In particular, strongly held beliefs about the nature of political deliberation in the IMO both constrain and enable business interests, sometimes overriding the general structural power of the shipping industry. This research implies that future scholarship of business power and lobbying should be attentive to specific institutionalized ideas structuring business actors’ range of legitimate activities, in particular in international institutions where individual negotiation sites can develop idiosyncratic norms and beliefs about the legitimacy of private actor participation.

We employ an event study methodology to detect abnormal stock reactions for the affiliated organization. The results indicate that #MeToo accusations substantially harmed the stock returns of the organization despite the accusation relating to an individual's misconduct. We discover significant results only for executives who are employed at the parent organization. Therefore, we first provide evidence that misconduct by individuals matters for organizations. We demonstrate that executive misconduct becomes particularly relevant when the executive assumes a leading position at the parent organization.

We implement a range of unsupervised algorithms, and we identify and validate three internally stable classes of decision-makers. One category corresponds to the classical style of satisficers; the other two subcategorize the maximisers' classical style. The customer’s entry channel preferences and movement patterns provide compelling support for the style's predictive validity.

Recent reviews have set out to clarify the conceptual boundaries between ecosystem concepts. Yet there is still a lack of clarity when it comes to which ecosystem types can best help organisations achieve various goals. This systematic literature review advances our understanding of the conceptual boundaries between different ecosystems and, more importantly, identifies which types of ecosystems are suitable for achieving the goals. We focus on four commonly studied ecosystem types: business, innovation, entrepreneurship and knowledge ecosystems. The key findings centre on systematically demarcating the ecosystem types by accounting for (and distinguishing between) their conceptual boundaries and goals. The results show how multifaceted ecosystem goals are and reveal several shifts in the literature on ecosystem types over time.

Today, the ongoing digital platforms revolution is facilitating these networked relationships. Nevertheless, despite recent technological advancements facilitating business interactions, there is a considerable lack of clarity about how and why offline B2B networks implement digital platforms solutions. In addition, the antecedents and determinants that drive their engagement are poorly understood in the literature. To address these challenges, this article examines the antecedents and determinants influencing the decisions of 1,704 offline networks (business associations, chambers of commerce, and employer's unions) to implement a new multisided digital market platform (MDMP). Mixed methods research, including semi-structured interviews and a large-scale survey were conducted. Overall, findings unveil that the knowledge on digital platforms’ potentials and acceptance levels remain limited. Shared and unique antecedents and determinants for MDMP implementation by business associations, chambers of commerce, and employer's unions emerged. The article also proposed a novel conceptual framework representing the mechanisms influencing the implementation of MDMPs. Grounded in the large-scale survey, we develop substantive theories on the factors influencing the decision of business associations, chambers of commerce, and employer's unions to implement MDMPs. These theories identify and describe the interrelated paradoxes that these three categories of B2B networks need to address when moving towards the digital platforms revolution. The new managerial, theoretical, and policy insights originating from this study advance the general knowledge in the field. © 2021","B2B networks; Business networks; Digital platform; Digital transformation: multisided market platform; Digitalization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122251136

When earnings management is possible, benchmarking creates stronger incentives for misreporting performance measures compared to benchmark-independent pay. The optimal contract will depend less on a correlated benchmark (e.g., a stock market index) if it is easier for the manager to misreport performance. Thus, the model predicts that firms with weak internal controls and bad auditors are less likely to use RPE, offering a theoretical explanation for the empirically observed lack of RPE use. © CAAA","CEO compensation; earnings management; relative performance evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121713515

Going back to Weber, the process toward a capable and professional bureaucracy has been viewed as driven by the entry of well-educated, professional recruits. We argue that this perspective misses important dynamics within professionalizing bureaucracies—in particular, how bureaucrats inside government react when bureaucracies professionalize. Building on this insight, we argue that incumbent bureaucrats face incentives to acquire greater expertise when educated entrants arrive, in order to remain competitive for organizational rewards (such as promotions) inside government and jobs outside government in case educated entrants “outcompete” them. We provide empirical support for these propositions with a priming experiment with 3,000 bureaucrats in Chile's central government. Bureaucrats primed about the professionalization of other bureaucrats put a greater premium on their own expertise acquisition.

Such low-leverage customers must find other ways of making themselves attractive to coveted suppliers. In this paper, we study how customers with low leverage manage the process of mobilizing supplier resources critical for innovation. We present findings from a single case study of a buying firm and show how they use five elements to gradually become attractive in the eyes of a critical supplier: proactive technological competence, canvassing and continuous communication, supplier learning, market access, and relationship maintenance. The different elements play different roles during the process of mobilizing supplier resources. We show that mobilizing suppliers in the case of low-leverage customers is a long-term process in which a number of interrelated attractiveness elements are leveraged in a complex pattern. This process is highly resource-demanding and requires substantial dedication and effort from the customer organization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Buyer-supplier relationships; Customer attractiveness; Innovation; Resource mobilization; Supplier involvement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121097192

However, little is known about business model innovation (BMI) processes and practices of small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) in their digital venturing. Thus, the aim of this paper is to address this research gap by investigating the process activities of SMEs in effectively building new business models through digitalization. Through a case study of 18 SMEs, document studies and 36 interviews, we explore the BMI processes during the case companies' digital transformation. The research results identify four critical BMI process activities: (1) assessing the environment in search of new opportunities, (2) conveying a sense of urgency, (3) exploring and testing new opportunities through experimentation and (4) handling decision-making with a combination of intuition and data. Finally, our study reveals managerial implications related to data-driven decision-making during BMI, constituting four managerial dilemmas: (1) prognosis and scenario-driven search myopia, (2) timing and sustainability, (3) radical shift from traditional experimentation to data-based methods and (4) using intuition versus data-driven decision-making. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","business model innovation; business models; decision-making; digital transformation; search behaviour; SME",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121033923

While digital champions are thriving, a large number of businesses and industries have been facing radical uncertainty, pushing some to the edge of collapse. This emergency calls for new ways to look at organizational ambidexterity and business model innovation. In this paper, we present and discuss a unique case study of a low-cost airline, AirAsia. With their fleet of aircraft grounded, and unable to pursue any incremental innovation opportunities, AirAsia decided to follow a radical ambidexterity path – focusing on exploration by building an innovation ecosystem. This case not only offers insights on a novel way to create value through open innovation but also extends the body of knowledge on entrepreneurial effectuation by introducing the concept of an ecosystem effectuation.

Simultaneously, SSOs must reflect members’ preferences in their network set-ups and governance. Yet, little is known about these preferences.

However, does this mean more ESG reporting is being done? If so, is the quality of ESG reports improving? And what about ESG performance? In this paper, we examine these three trends in ESG reporting—quantity, quality and corporate ESG performance. With a Swedish multinational corporate focus, we analyse data from Sustainalytics, corporateregister.com and the Alliance for Corporate Transparency to answer our research questions. Our analysis shows that, while the quality of ESG information in Sweden has steadily improved, performance plateaued around 2015. Mitigating problems such as the impacts of climate change and COVID-19 call for improved ESG performance, not improved ESG reporting quantity or quality. Thus, rather than focusing on improving ESG reporting regulations, we need to redirect our focus towards creating better ESG outcomes. Therefore, we argue that companies must be asked to provide data that are more timely, relevant, credible and comparable and that demonstrate improved ESG performance. With this information, financial analysts and investors can redirect and accelerate capital flows towards corporate investments that help tackle important problems related to climate crises and the reaching of a sustainable development. Our analysis reveals that we need more research focusing on consumers, investors and policymakers. Future scholars could explore how changing consumer preferences are driving improvements in ESG performance and how changing capital market allocations affect ESG performance. © 2021 The Authors.

Focusing on the fundamental leader characteristic identified in the international entrepreneurship literature, i.e., risk propensity, we develop and test an original framework for analysis, which suggests that CEOs with greater risk propensity will tend to steer their firms towards greater degrees of internationalization and towards more risky venues/locations (countries at a greater cultural distance) and vehicles/entry modes (acquisitions versus alliances). We also more precisely assess our underlying assumption of agentic CEOs affecting firms’ internationalization decisions by positing and testing additional moderator relationships, in which we suggest that the effect of CEO risk propensity on the riskiness of firms’ internationalization choices will be (1) amplified when CEOs enjoy greater power, and (2) attenuated for firms with greater internationalization experience. Empirically, our analyses show significant and robust support for both our main effect and moderator hypotheses.

Hundreds of papers in our field conceptualize responsiveness and related concepts in disconnected ways ignoring this potentially valuable foundation for investigating supply chain strategic and logistical adjustments. Although these extant studies highlight many important issues related to responsiveness, their conceptualizations and nomological networks vary considerably. This diffuse focus seriously hinders efforts to create an overarching theoretical perspective in a dynamic field without one. The result is a masking of promising research directions that could help define the discipline. Drawing from the organizational economics, logistics, and supply chain management literatures, we begin the argument that responsiveness—realized through logistics and supply chain management—has strong potential as our defined foundational perspective. All roads to superior performance depend upon supply chain responsiveness to the environment, supply chain members, stakeholders, and the consumer.

The underlying premise is that if a firm continues to collaborate with a university, it must consider that collaboration to be valuable. A quantitative analysis of over 2600 firms reveals that persistence is relatively common in university–industry collaborations on innovation, with more than a third of firms that engage in university collaboration continuing to collaborate with the same university over two consecutive periods. In addition, the analysis shows that firms’ investments in collaborative capabilities and different dimensions of absorptive capacity are instrumental for persistent collaboration with a university. Furthermore, persistent collaboration with a university is strongly associated with the strategic choice to engage in sustained collaboration with a broad range of partner types. Finally, the analysis reveals that geographical proximity between a firm and a university may facilitate the initiation of a collaboration, although the nearest university is not necessarily the most suitable partner. This is illustrated by the finding that geographical proximity between a firm and a university does not matter for keeping together in a persistent collaboration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Absorptive capacity; Collaborative capabilities; Geographical proximity; Openness; Technically oriented universities; University graduates; University–industry collaboration","Absorptive capacity; Geographical proximity; Industry collaboration; Strategic choice; University collaborations; Engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115146189

We show that the effects of AI are varied and depend on whether AI is used for providing orders to humans or providing information for further human handling and in which occupation it is used. AI may enhance or augment skills through, for example, the increased use of high-performance work practices, or it may increase work pace constraints and reduce employee autonomy. The results imply that the diffusion of AI can increase inequalities in the labour market by augmenting skills used in high-skill jobs, although having relatively more adverse impacts on other jobs. We use additive noise modelling to establish the likely direction of causality in our results and find that the direction of causality is from AI use to skill requirements. © 2021 Brian Towers (BRITOW) and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","additive noise modelling; artificial intelligence; autonomy; constraints; high-performance work practices; job requirements approach; learning; skills","artificial intelligence; data set; employment; labor market; learning; numerical model; occupation; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114903014

This is optimal for optimistic managers even though they understand that tighter covenants increase the probability of covenant violations and lead to excessive lender intervention. The broad reason for this result is that optimists wish to write contracts that repay lenders more frequently in bad states rather than in good states, and the only way to achieve this is by granting lenders more control rights.

This realization of platform governments leads us to rethink what have been predicted decades ago. Time has come for us to really open up real opportunities by facing realistic challenges for public management. The pressure for government innovations, such as algorithmic bureaucracy and collaborative value creation, is increasing. Attentions need to be paid with respect to how the managerial role and activities are being transformed, how the nature of work in government is fundamentally changed, and how the decision-making processes are re-institutionalized. Further research issues are discussed at the end of this Viewpoint. Evidence for Practice: Platform governments predicted earlier are now being realized by highly integrative technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, social media, mobile computing, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. Platform government demands new approaches to public management, changes the nature of work of public managers, and reshapes the decision-making processes. Algorithmic bureaucracy provisioned by these new platformization will enable more anticipatory decision-making, require stronger leadership commitment on digitalization and innovation, and provide higher agility in public management. Collaborative value creation can and will be expedited by the technological capabilities provided but also with a lot of social experimentation on these platforms.

This is a cornerstone result in the pensions literature where many attempts have been made to explain that individual savings in annuities is very low, the socalled annuity puzzle. But is the result that all pension savings should be in life-annuities also socially optimal? We show in a standard setting with fair annuities and dynamic efficiency that full annutization of all pensions saving is not socially optimal. Less than full annutization implies unintentional bequests and thus transfers from the old to the young, which is welfare improving under dynamic efficiency. Further, we show that no annutization can implement the Golden Rule capital stock level and analyse whether some annutization is socially optimal using a numerical analysis, which shows that it is the case under a wide range of parameter constellations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Annuitization; Annuity markets; Dynamic efficiency; Mortality risk; Overlapping generations; Welfare",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113763515

Numerous business models (BM) have been limited or rendered downright impossible due to decreased social contact. SMEs can respond to this exogenous crisis via temporary business model innovation (BMI). This empirical study investigates these temporary BMs using a multiple case study approach based on five SMEs in Austria, Germany, and Liechtenstein who within a short period of time applied their core competencies and networks to integrate new BMs, which were in some cases very different from existing ones. These had a positive effect on strategic flexibility, and if desired can also be incorporated into the firm long-term.

Moreover, we contribute to BMI literature by explaining temporary BMI as a new form of BMI.

In this climate, megamarketing – efforts to develop and sustain an industry or market by gaining the cooperation and support of various stakeholders and publics – is an increasingly relevant approach. Current research in megamarketing focuses on understanding how various industry actors and stakeholders establish the legitimacy of a given industry by accommodating prevailing regulatory, normative, and cultural-cognitive structures. In contrast, this paper examines megamarketing efforts that go beyond such attempts to establish legitimacy towards establishing an industry as a virtuous entity displaying qualities that surpass minimal accepted standards and ‘business-as-usual.’ Inspired by work on virtue ethics in organisational studies, we develop the concept of industry aura: a ‘halo’ of unique and authentic virtues that characterise an industry. We explore the development of industry aura by surveying the discursive megamarketing tactics through which microfinance has been established as a virtuous industry. We conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses of 589 articles about microfinance appearing in five selected newspapers between 1986 and 2016. Our findings reveal three sets of megamarketing discursive tactics: 1) diagnostic framing and social mission framing, deployed to establish microfinance as a virtuous entity; 2) virtue anchoring and frame bridging, used to defend the industry's aura in times of authenticity crisis; and 3) diagnostic and social-mission reframing aimed at recovering the tarnished aura of microfinance. Our paper enriches megamarketing research by charting relevant terrain that stretches beyond the established vectors of legitimacy theorizing and offers important implications for megamarketing practitioners. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Authenticity; Industry aura; Legitimacy; Megamarketing; Microfinance; Virtue ethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111043388

Content analysis is used to assess the mandatory disclosure of BM in in 75 publicly listed companies' annual reports across a three-year period (2014–2016). The research applies a novel content analysis methodology that considers the way in which the relevance of BM disclosures is dependent on which particular BM a given company adopts. The empirical results show notably low levels of BM disclosure and no significant association between BM disclosures and market value. However, we find that BM disclosure provides insights into earnings quality by means of enhanced earnings persistence. These findings reveal that information about the BM itself does not make a difference to investors when it is not linked to financial outcomes. Instead, BM acts as a framework for organizing other disclosures, and provides complementary information about value generation, helping users understand how earnings are generated. These results are important for informing the policy-making process around extra-financial disclosures (e.g., EU Directive 2014/95/EU) and answer calls for research to inform future improvements to corporate and integrated reporting. © 2021 Accounting Foundation, The University of Sydney.","Business models; Earnings persistence; Narrative reporting; Non-financial disclosure; Non-financial regulation; Value relevance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110760065

The authors conceptualize a privacy calculus that represents a consumer's trade–off of the valence and uncertainty of the consequences of the collection, storage, and use of personal information. For example, usage-based car insurance requires drivers to share data on their driving behavior in exchange for a discount (certain benefit) but at the risk of third parties intercepting location data for malicious use (uncertain disadvantage). Building on this conceptualization, the authors develop the privacy calculus (PRICAL) index. They empirically confirm the validity of the items (Study 1) and the index as a whole (Study 2). The PRICAL index is generally applicable and improves the explanation of behavioral intentions (Study 2) and actual behavior (Study 3), compared with currently used constructs (e.g., privacy concern, trust). Overall, the PRICAL index allows managers to understand consumers’ acceptance of information collection regarding financial, performance, psychological, security, social, and time-related consequences, which the authors demonstrate using the top five most valuable digital brands (Study 4). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Index development; Information collection; Privacy; Privacy calculus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110524534

The gaps suggest the need for fundamental theoretical development about the resources and capabilities underlying the development, application, and derived value of SCT. This research designed a case study around a BCT implementation project between a small artisan coffee producer and a startup BCT service provider.

Second, a higher level of judicial delegation has a positive effect on the volume of case law, while limiting legislative activity. Third, the precision of the Treaty provisions constrains the volume of secondary legislation. The findings show how the type and intensity of supranational delegation shape supranational policy development. © 2021 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","European Union; policy development; supranational delegation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108820287

High-performer mobility induces a loss of human assets but might also enable competition by transferring human and complementary assets from the parent firm to a competitor. Only when such transfer occurs is mobility to same-industry startups more harmful than other types of high-performer mobility. Human and complementary asset transfer is conditional on the departing high performer's ability to accumulate (and hence transfer) knowledge from the parent firm and the recipient firm's ability to absorb such knowledge. In support of this hypothesis, we show that the high performer's tenure and the startup's resources (size) moderate the performance effect of high-performer mobility on same-industry startups. Managerial Summary: Industry experience is critical for new venture performance, and spinoff entrepreneurs (former employees from the same industry) perform better than other start-ups. However, studies have found that high performers' mobility to spinoffs harms the performance of their former employers. This paper asks when do spinoffs result in increasing competition and when is spinoff entrepreneurship more harmful compared to other types of high performer mobility? We show that additional detrimental performance effects on former employers depend on employee tenure and the spinoffs' start-up size. We argue that longer tenure increases competition because it allows the employee to form and strengthen personal relations, for example, to customers, and to accumulate more knowledge on products and processes. Start-up size is important for the recreation and appropriation of this knowledge. © 2021 Strategic Management Society.","complementary assets; high-performer mobility; human assets; parent firm performance; spinoffs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108366764

Research Findings/Insights: Employing an international sample of 8,687 non-financial cross-border acquisitions conducted by 4,630 acquirer firms from 40 home markets to 66 host countries between 2004 and 2013, we find a U-shaped relationship between family blockholding of voting rights and the relative size of international acquisitions. Further, we find evidence that this relationship is moderated by the presence and type of financial blockholders. While pressure-resistant financial blockholders shift this relationship downwards (due to intensified conflicts), pressure-sensitive financial blockholders shift it upwards. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the literature on family firm governance and internationalization on several fronts. First, we revisit the predominant logic of linear effects of the family blockholding. We suggest the family blockholding's effects are related to nonlinear risk preferences of family owners, expressed through socioemotional wealth (SEW) slack. Second, we suggest that the “dominant shareholder interest” assumption of family firms, usually based on the controlling family's SEW should be interpreted contingent upon the interests of other financial shareholders. Finally, using family-financial blockholder conflicts as the scenario, we suggest that principal-principal conflicts depend on the composition of the conflicting blockholders, specifically, upon the nature of their relations with the firm. Practitioner/Policy Implications: This study offers insights to policymakers and those interested in incentivizing family ownership that family owners' risk behaviors should be understood and discussed in the context of different financial blockholders as a reference group. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","corporate governance; family firms; financial blockholders; international acquisitions; pressure-resistant; pressure-sensitive, socioemotional wealth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108359551

To achieve such an open innovation approach, several initiatives have been launched in order to leverage potential distributed knowledge sources that go beyond those available to any single organization. A particular tool that has gained some momentum during COVID-19 times is hackathons, which have been used to unleash the innovation potential of individuals who voluntarily came together, for a relatively short period of time, with the aim to solve specific problems. In this paper, we describe and analyze the case of the hackathon EUvsVirus, led by the European Innovation Council. EUvs Virus was a 3-day online hackathon to connect civil society, innovators, partners, and investors across Europe and beyond in order to develop innovative solutions to coronavirus-related challenges. We have identified four dimensions to explore hackathons as a crowdsourcing tool for practicing effective open innovation in the face of COVID-19: broad scope, participatory architecture, online setting, and community creation. We discuss how these four elements can play a strategic role in the face of grand challenges, which require, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, both urgent action and long-term thinking. Our case analysis also suggests the need to look beyond the ‘usual suspects’, through knowledge recombination with atypical resources (e.g., retired experts, graduate students, and the general public). On this basis, we call for a broader perspective on open innovation, to be extended beyond openness across organizational boundaries, and to explore the role of openness at societal level. © 2021 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100511707

This raises questions about how ordinary citizens make judgements and voice them in online spaces. This paper addresses these questions by examining how Western citizens ascribe responsibility and action in relation to corporate misconduct. Empirically, it focuses on modern slavery and analyses online debates in Denmark on child slavery in the cocoa industry. Conceptually, it introduces the notion of cosmopolitanism as a general disposition of care and responsibility towards distant others, conceived as a prerequisite for the critical evaluation of corporate (ir)responsibility in the Global South. The analysis of online debates shows that citizens debate child slavery in terms of individual consumer responsibility rather than corporate responsibility. Corporations are not considered potential agents of change. As a consequence, online citizen debates did not reflect a legitimacy crisis for the cocoa industry, as debates over responsibility were overwhelmingly concerned with the agency of the Western individual, the individual agency of the speakers themselves. Participants in debates understood their agency strictly as consumer agency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Cosmopolitanism; Legitimacy; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099063732

But how do these effects play out in the strategies of platform providers and complementors as the ecosystem evolves? We study how user preferences for ecosystem innovativeness (complement novelty and quality) and ecosystem size (number of complementors/complements), and demand-based economies of scale, shape the strategic interactions between the platform provider and the complementors in the ecosystem. Using an analytical model, we identify the conditions that give rise to a trade-off between ecosystem innovativeness and size; when (and why) this trade-off generates a tension between value co-creation and appropriation among ecosystem participants; and the strategic implications for ecosystem competitiveness and for the different stages of the ecosystem's evolution. Managerial summary: Managing complementors’ incentives is critical for the success of a platform ecosystem. Such incentives may be offered not only for joining the platform, but also for contributing high-quality, innovative complements throughout the ecosystem's evolution. In this article, we show that demand-side economies of scale are the driving force of complementors’ incentives, and hence the key success factor for platform strategies. The strength of user preferences ultimately determines whether a larger ecosystem can also be more innovative, in which case all ecosystem participants can gain; or if instead there is a trade-off between size and innovativeness, which could also lead to a tension between value co-creation and appropriation among the platform provider and its complementors. The different stages of the evolution of a platform ecosystem call for different strategies that adapt to the evolution of user preferences. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ecosystem innovativeness; indirect network effects; platform ecosystems; platform evolution; user preferences","Economic and social effects; Economics; Indirect network effects; Innovativeness; Platform ecosystems; platform evolution; user preferences; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082932803

The patient trajectory is formed by short stays within health-care organizations, which requires a substantial effort for professionals to be successful in clarifying each patient's medical situation. The patients, at the same time, often have complicated illness stories, and professionals only see a limited part of the patient's trajectory. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on extensive ethnographic studies in a newly established cardiac day unit introducing same-day discharge schemes for patients with ischemic and arrhythmic heart disease. Findings: The findings demonstrate that the patient trajectory becomes a “temporal patient trajectory” and encounters a short-term reality, where tensions arise between admission time and the trajectory as a whole. In managing temporal patient trajectories, formal organizing and patient experiences intersect in events that emerge from conversations and span past, present and future in relation to patient treatment. Professionals engage in articulation work to maintain coherence by allowing patients to hold different events together over time. Originality/value: The paper provides new insights into the challenges of managing trajectories in same-day discharge schemes where the pressure to move quickly and ensure patient discharge is intense. The paper offers a novel theoretical perspective on trajectory management as an ongoing temporal process. The analysis displays temporal tensions between patient experiences and the accelerated discharge scheme and how professionals manage to overcome these tensions by bridging the patient's long illness story and the short trajectory within the cardiac day unit. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Articulation work; Ethnography; Same-day discharge; Temporality; Trajectories",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112353929

However, such benefits materialize only if active employee participation is ensured. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how individual employees use an ESM platform to assist their knowledge-related activities. This paper contributes to this topic by proposing a classification of ESM users based on two dimensions: frequency and type (active or passive) of use. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents the results of a survey of 262 employees of an international engineering service company that has adopted an ESM platform to support its KM processes. Statistical methods (e.g. ANOVA, Tukey’s b) were applied to verify the usefulness of the proposed typology and identify the main aspects that characterize the different user groups. Findings: The survey results confirm the existence of different types of ESM users and provide the empirical basis for developing a bi-dimensional classification from which four user groups were derived and characterized: frequent contributors, sporadic contributors, frequent lurkers and sporadic lurkers. Research limitations/implications: The main limitation is that only one company in one sector with specific knowledge needs and capabilities was investigated. Practical implications: The study provides useful suggestions for how to promote the use of an ESM and particularly for how to encourage less frequent and less active users to increase their participation in a platform. Originality/value: The paper contributes to a better understanding of how employees approach ESM by identifying factors that characterize different user groups. © 2021, Kathrin Kirchner, Rasmus Jørgensen, Ettore Bolisani and Enrico Scarso.","Contributor; Enterprise social media; Knowledge management; Lurker; Survey; Users’ typology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106222910

To limit this, targeted N regulation at the ID15 (1500 ha) level is slowly becoming a reality for farmers and authorities in Denmark. This paper explores the formulation of value propositions connected to developed technologies and concepts for retention mapping at the field level for more detailed targeted regulation. We explore all this through a comprehensive longitudinal ethnographic case study over a period of three years. We use the value proposition canvas to make sense of the viewpoints of the involved stakeholder groups. Our empirical setting is a large-scale research project in Denmark, a country that has high environmental goals regarding nitrogen loading. The publicly funded project involved a multitude of stakeholders, ranging from industry consultants, regulators, farmers and researchers from several disciplines. Important for our study is the fact that much of Denmark's regulation is based on a consensus-driven approach. Thus, it provides a compelling setting for exploring the creation of value propositions through multisector stakeholder engagement. Our findings indicate that, while there is a general movement towards targeted N regulation due to an advancement of knowledge, the practical side of its implementation is less straightforward. Here, stakeholder-formulated value propositions can facilitate this process, not only being connected to the measurement technology, but also relying on a link to a regulatory transformation. © 2022 The Authors","Aquatic pollution; Governance model; Groundwater nitrogen retention; Nitrogen fertilizer; Stakeholder engagement; Triple helix; Value propositions","Cultivation; Groundwater pollution; Nitrogen fertilizers; Aquatic pollution; Denmark; Governance models; Groundwater nitrogen retention; Nitrogen regulation; Nitrogen retention; Stakeholder engagement; Sustainable values; Triple helixes; Value proposition; Groundwater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123371657

These challenges are still more salient for the small breweries due to the recognized lack of resources, such as knowledge, finances, and skilled staff. To address this problem, this article aims to identify sustainable strategies for waste management and biomass valorization that can be implemented in the value chain of small breweries. A mixed-method approach was implemented for the data collection and analysis to expand the evidence of the findings, including interviews with 18 small breweries and six specialists in the sector. We found that breweries mainly dispose of the by-products for animal feeding, although industry experts and the specialized literature indicate that at least 21 reuse and recycling alternatives have not been implemented in the value chain. Findings add to the literature five new alternatives informed by companies and six informed by experts for circular and cleaner production realization in small breweries’ value chains. Furthermore, the article proposes a novel conceptual model to facilitate waste management and biomass valorization realization in small breweries value chains. Findings provide new insights that complement previous studies to overcome the challenges for waste management and biomass valorization in the sector.

Despite several advantages, biodiesel processing produces a significant amount of waste, mainly water and glycerol. In this study, using a circular economy approach, an integrated biodiesel biorefinery is designed and analyzed to assess whether it can lead to better economics and a zero-waste scenario. To achieve these goals, one stand-alone and three integrated scenarios were analyzed: (1) stand-alone biodiesel production; biodiesel production integrated with (2) methanol production from CO2; (3) bio-succinic acid production; and (4) methanol and bio-succinic acid production. Each scenario was evaluated based on rigorous profitability, sensitivity and environmental analysis. For each scenario, biodiesel's minimum selling price in USD/kg was 0.30, 0.39, 0.22 and 0.44 respectively. Thereby, making integration (3) and (4) the most and least profitable respectively. By sensitivity analysis, waste cooking oil price and total capital investment were the most sensitive variables. From sustainability perspective, the scenario (3) has a waste production of 0.68 kg/kg-product, in which wastewater is 0.55 kg/kg-product. Finally, to improve sustainability, two improvements were implemented: multi-effect evaporation and wastewater treatment. Through this implementation, the waste production was reduced by 81% to 0.13 kg-waste/kg-product. © 2022 The Authors","Bio-succinic acid; Biodiesel; Biorefinery; Process integration; Sustainability; Zero-waste","Bioconversion; Biodiesel; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Methanol; Oils and fats; Profitability; Refining; Sensitivity analysis; Wastewater treatment; Acid production; Bio-succinic acid; Biodiesel production; Biorefineries; Biorefinery concept; Processes integrations; Stand -alone; Succinic acids; Waste production; Zero waste; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122679067

This is particularly relevant for the construction sector, which is the highest producer of waste and one of the main causes of resources consumption. The paper objective is to analyse the present level of application of circularity strategies, identifying the related barriers and drivers, through interviews with building stakeholders across five European countries, Belgium (Flanders), Netherlands, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Italy. The analysis focuses on the building level and assesses the level of application in current policies and practices of circular strategies in three key field: resource and waste management, design for reversible building, and business for the networking of operators in the construction value chain. The results highlight the different and fragmented circular strategies currently applied in the analysed countries analysed, highlighting the need for more effective and coordinated actions and policies promoted by European Commission. In particular, the current legislative framework promotes the waste management strategies, focusing more on recycling practices than on reuse or resource management. The design strategies for reversible building are generally in private initiatives, driven by market competitions, rather than by public incentives. The application of circular business models and the creation of circular networks among the operators of the value chain is still lacking. Furthermore, the use of life-cycle tools to assess the environmental effectiveness (sustainability) of circular strategies is rarely applied. The recommendations that emerged from the comparison of the current applications of circular economy strategies across the countries analysed and demanded by key players in the construction sector interviewed, include the need for greater international coordination in terms of policy, practices and enabling tools (digital data, platforms, traceability). Improvements in both the legislative framework and practices are needed. Future development of research regards, in particular, the fields of digital supporting tools and environmental assessment (LCA), circular relationships and business models and the definition/training of new expertise related to enabling aspects. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Business models; Circular buildings; Circular economy policies; Resource efficiency; Sustainability assessment","Architectural design; Competition; Life cycle; Structural design; Sustainable development; Waste management; 'current; Business models; Circular building; Circular economy; Circular economy policy; Circular strategies; Construction sectors; European Countries; Resource efficiencies; Sustainability assessment; Construction industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122624950

Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopted a multiple-case study strategy for the purpose of theory building. Seven players from the Fintech ecosystem in Quebec (Canada) were selected, representing financial institutions, Fintech start-ups and Quebec’s financial cluster. Primary data was collected via in-depth interviews with ten respondents at the level of vice presidents, Managers, directors, chief executive officers and founders, and unobtrusive data – in the form of running records, mass-media news reports, presentations and proceedings from Fintech events.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a conceptual framework for how IR 4.0 technologies affect consumer well-being in five representative sectors: health care, education, financial services, manufacturing and retailing. The authors argue that the potential transformations of these specific sectors, facilitated by these technologies, may have profound effects on consumer well-being, with urgent public policy implications. Findings: Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, three-dimensional printing, machine learning and blockchain, provide customers with novel approaches toward decisions regarding health, education, finances and other fundamental parts of their lives. The organizations that provide these services, such as hospitals, universities and banks, actively adopt the innovations offered by IR 4.0. These evolving and disruptive technologies thus are changing reality for consumers and providers. Originality/value: This paper proposes some novel public policy implications of IR 4.0 technologies for consumer well-being, and it outlines further research directions that can enhance understanding of relevant technologies and the consequences of their use for society. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Biological technologies; Digital technologies; Fourth industrial revolution; Physical technologies; Public policy implications; Technology-enabled well-being",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122059862

MPs are resilient to degradation, but extreme conditions, such as high temperature and pressure, can lead to residues that can be used as fertilizers on farmlands. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) creates such conditions, converting sludge into valuable bio-crude. To this end, the current study examined the resilience of MPs in sewage sludge that were treated by continuous HTL operated at supercritical water conditions (400 °C, 30 MPa). MPs were extracted before and after the HTL process and quantified by Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Particles of 10–500 μm were quantified using Focal Plane Array (FPA) based micro-FTIR (FPA-μ-FTIR) imaging combined with an automated analysis of the generated spectral image, while Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR)-FTIR was used for MPs >500 μm. The continuous HTL led to an MP reduction of approximately 76% in terms of MP number and 97% in terms of MP mass. The difference in reduction of the number of MPs versus their accumulated mass was the result of MPs being smaller after the HTL process. A total of 18 polymer types were detected in the sludge and slurry entering the continuous HTL while only 11 types were identified in the residual materials. No MPs were detected in the bio-crude, i.e. the most favorable product of the process. The polymer composition changed considerably as a result of the HTL process. Polyurethane, polypropylene, and polyethylene were the dominant polymers in the feedstock, while polypropylene and polyethylene were the most present in the residual products. The findings indicate that HTL can be efficient in reducing MPs in highly polluted sludge from wastewater treatment plants, leaving the byproducts and residuals significantly less polluted, hereby reducing the movement of MPs to the terrestrial environment. Thus the products are better suited for sustainability efforts than the raw material. © 2022 The Authors","Bio-crude; Hydrothermal liquefaction; Microplastics; Polymers; Sewage sludge","Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fourier transforms; Polyethylenes; Polypropylenes; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Spectrum analysis; Sustainable development; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; % reductions; Bio-crude; Focal-plane arrays; Fourier transformations; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Infrared: spectroscopy; Liquefaction process; Microplastics; Waste water treatment plants; Wastewater treatment sludge; Sewage sludge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122283746

Research has especially emphasised the broad perspective on the cooperative challenge, while less emphasis has been put directly on the specific intra-organisational challenge of nurturing cross-departmental cooperation. The article aims to provide explorative empirical insight into sustainability coordinators’ internal efforts to organise and support innovative forms of sustainability cooperation. The study sheds light on two different approaches to sustainability coordination based on two separate research studies of forerunning Scandinavian municipalities. It shows how five structural factors: capacity, scope, willingness, mandates and resources, are enacted differently in the centralised approach of Växjö (Sweden) and the decentralised approach of Aarhus (Denmark). The conclusion highlights the delicate work needed to create engagement with sustainability across differences in departmental scopings and hierarchical distribution of mandates and resources. Finally, it points to how the two approaches could be complementary, as coordination in Aarhus established a robust commitment to narrow action points, while Växjö delegated more vague action points broadly throughout the entire organisation. © 2022 The Authors","Cooperation; Implementation; Interdisciplinary; Local government; Organisation; SDGs","Centralized approaches; Cooperation; Implementation; Interdisciplinary; Internal efforts; Local government; Organisational; Research studies; SDG; Structural factor; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122232760

The cost of renewable energy has decreased dramatically in the last decade. The intermittency of renewable energy, however, remains a serious challenge to be overcome. Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is widely considered to be a promising energy storage technology at utility-scale and receives increasing attention from both academic and industrial communities. In this study, two novel CAES systems are proposed and a thorough investigation and comparison of the thermodynamic performance of both conventional and novel CAES systems have been performed. The turbine inlet temperature and the maximum cavern storage pressure are identified as the bottlenecks of CAES plants. The round-trip efficiency and energy density are chosen as the conflicting objectives. Pareto fronts are obtained based on the simulation-based multi-objective optimization framework developed in this study. The energy density of a diabatic CAES plant is within the range between 4.24 and 11.58 kWh/m3, while that value becomes 1.28–7.96 kWh/m3 for a conventional adiabatic CAES system. The novel two-pressure level adiabatic CAES system can improve the round-trip efficiency by at least 3.5% compared with the conventional adiabatic CAES system. The novel indirect heating diabatic CAES system can improve the round-trip efficiency by at least 2%. The Pareto fronts can be a useful tool for the grassroot design or retrofit of a CAES plant. Solutions to improve the CAES system performance have been proposed based on the optimization results of this study. © 2021","Compressed air energy storage; Energy density; Multi-objective optimization; Round-trip efficiency","Compressed air; Compressed air energy storage; Pressure vessels; Diabatic; Energy density; Energy storage plant; Intermittency; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto front; Renewable energies; Round trip; Round-trip efficiency; Storage systems; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122150628

One potential outcome may be through virtual global mobility (VGM), defined as the replacement of personal physical international interactions for work purposes with electronic personal online interactions. The purpose of this article is to establish VGM as a theoretical concept and explore to what extent it can replace or complement physical global work assignments. Design/methodology/approach: This perspectives article first explores advantages and disadvantages of global virtual work and then discusses the implementation of VGM and analyses to what extent and how VGM can replace and complement physical global mobility. Findings: Representing a change of trend, long-term corporate expatriates could become necessary core players in VGM activities while the increase of the number of global travelers may be halted or reversed. VGM activities will grow and further develop due to a continued rapid development of communication and coordination technologies. Consequently, VGM is here to stay! Originality/value: The authors have witnessed a massive trend of increasing physical global mobility where individuals have crossed international borders to conduct work. The authors are now observing the emergence of a counter-trend: instead of moving people to their work the authors often see organizations moving work to people.

In particular, the authors focus on the roles of home and host country identification as an emotional resource for overcoming the negative effects of job-related burnout. Design/methodology/approach: Survey responses from 123 diplomats were used to assess the moderating role of home and host country identification on the relationship between burnout and career satisfaction. Findings: Various combinations of high or low home or host country identification were tested, and the findings suggest that the negative effect of burnout on career satisfaction is reduced for those individuals that have high identification with both the home and the host country, while this is not the case for other combinations. This points to the beneficial effects of dual national identifications even for diplomats – a group that would normally be expected to identify strongly with the home country alone. Originality/value: No existing study that the authors know of has explored the relationship between burnout, national identity and career satisfaction among diplomats or other types of expatriates.

Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model is proposed based on five elements: servitization drivers (digitalization in particular), agents, modes (based on the standardization/customization dynamics), servitization mechanisms (the authors provide a new classification) and service experiences. Findings: CCI is not considered a natural part of the service sector. They drive economic and social development and are part of the innovation ecosystem. They are confronting a set of emerging dynamics in which servitization plays a leading role. Servitization is a way to move toward value co-creation by transforming existing business models. Servitization – with digitalization facilitates the co-creation of CCI-based experiences for customers, users and other stakeholders. Research limitations/implications: In terms of further research implications, these theoretical and managerial considerations call for empirical research of the servitization of CCI to investigate how and how much it develops. Practical implications: CCI companies need new business models that combine servitization, digitalization and value co-creation in the right mix. “One size fits all” does not work.

The meat industry’s low-cost business model, using employee posting and subcontracting on a massive scale, has led to extreme forms of unsafe working and poor living conditions for large numbers of Central and Eastern European workers. But it is only in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic that the German government decided to ban subcontracting, posting and temporary work in this industry. Why did COVID-19 make a difference? In an industry in which the livelihoods of local communities in Germany’s pig belt and in deprived rural parts of Romania have become structurally dependent on subcontracting, institutional change would not have happened without the pre-existing mobilisation of the above-mentioned advocacy coalition. But COVID-19 created a ‘perfect storm’ that empowered this coalition by helping reframe the meat industry issue away from a ‘narrow’ employment regulation problem into a ‘broader’ public health threat. Indeed, after becoming a virus hotspot, the meat industry was no longer just a threat to the livelihoods of its own workers, but to those of the wider local community. © The Author(s) 2022.","COVID-19; Germany; meat industry; Romania; subcontracting; trade unions; working conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130306115

We extend prior IB research that finds both positive and negative associations between environmental policies and MNE investments by showing that the relationship between environmental policy and MNE subsidiary investments is mediated by the effectiveness with which host countries enforce these policies. Specifically, we posit that environmental policies are effective when countries align them with tangible institutional outcomes such as actual reductions in emissions or increases in renewable energy production. This reduces uncertainty by providing a reliable and efficient framework for economic transactions. We test our arguments on a sample of 882 public US firms and their subsidiaries in 102 countries from 2000 to 2015, in conjunction with the Kyoto Protocol. We find that ratifying the Kyoto Protocol is associated with reductions in countries’ emission levels and increased reliance on renewables. Further, increased reliance on renewables positively mediates the relationship between the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol and MNEs foreign subsidiary investments. For host countries, this relationship is stronger when there are greater improvements in institutions’ quality. For MNEs, this relation is weaker for those MNEs associated with higher pollution. We find no such relationships for greenhouse gas emissions. Our findings contribute to the growing IB literature on environmental sustainability by highlighting the importance of effective institutions and their interaction with country- and firm-level heterogeneities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Greenhouse gas emissions; Institutions; Kyoto Protocol; Renewable energy; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125653486

Although many China scholars seem to subscribe to this view, few have attempted to explore and theorise the relation directly. This article argues that to fully understand China’s (in)ability to wield soft power on the international stage, it is necessary to identify the underlying discursive structures, or building blocks, of China’s national identity. Based on an extensive reading of the secondary literature, the article singles out four relatively distinct discursive building blocks—“Sino-civilization”, “Confucianism”, the “Century of Humiliation” and the “Communist March” —each of which is critical to the articulation of Chinese identity in the 21st century. Following a description of these building blocks, this article shows, by examining a selection of public speeches by Xi Jinping, how the discursive building blocks have enabled and constrained the official narrative construction of China’s national identity. Against this backdrop, it is argued that China’s national identity is predominantly particularistic, or Sino-centric, and that this particularism places serious limitations on China’s soft power potential. © China: An International Journal.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125277630

Capitalism is blamed for a variety of economic and social ills. We argue that these critiques are often misguided because they often confuse capitalism with cronyism, which is a system of government favoritism toward particular firms. We begin by outlining the basic principles and advantages of capitalism as a system of economic exchange, and we explain how cronyism is antithetical to the basic tenets of capitalism. We then delineate various forms of cronyism and explain how cronyism diverts resources from more productive uses, undermines government institutions, insulates firms from market-based competition, and discourages innovation, economic growth, and social welfare over the long term. We further argue that the failure to differentiate capitalism from cronyism has contributed to the view that capitalism itself is unjust, rigged to benefit the politically connected, and responsible for various harms that can and should be attributed to cronyism. The article concludes by demonstrating the negative consequences of conflating cronyism and capitalism for research, teaching, and practice, and by making suggestions to thwart cronyism. © Academy of Management Perspectives",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125227602

We particularly draw attention to how such entrepreneuring processes, as imaginative-poetic extensions beyond the present, can occur in a variety of societal, institutional and organizational contexts. Overall we focus on entrepreneuring as the process of creating organization. As a result, we believe that important insights arise by drawing attention to ways of ‘starting’ and ‘actualizing’, rather than conceptualizing entrepreneurship as something that was already ‘started’ in the past.

The imaginary is human|microbiome harmony, pleasurably negotiated through what goes into our bodies, materially, sensorially, nutritionally, and emotionally, and what comes out—our shit. To anticipate from and towards this imaginary, we use autoethnographic inquiry to estrange researcher thinking, a ‘kitchen research lab in the wild’ to expose early ideas to public scrutiny, and a four-part workshop to estrange participant thinking. The workshop was conducted with people who struggle with serious gut disease, and close family members with ostensibly healthy guts. The activities reconfigure embodied design methods around, with and through food to engender a fertile space in which participants may address vulnerability and taboo, and embody anticipation of alternative relationships with their gut microbiome.

Empirical research in this tradition has provided extremely robust evidence that dominant groups in society are more likely to volunteer. At the same time, it has reinforced the status quo in the production of knowledge on volunteering, thereby neglecting the clear problematic of “inequality in volunteering.” Compared to the guiding question of “participation,” the concept of “inequality” can generate a more variegated, critical, and change-oriented research agenda.

Uncertain customer requests are considered at the strategic planning stage. These requests are revealed before operations commence in each operational period. At the operational level, a new model for vehicle power consumption is suggested. In addition to mechanical power consumption, this model accounts for cabin climate control power, which is dependent on ambient temperature, and auxiliary power, which accounts for energy drawn by external devices. We formulate the problem of stochastic fleet size and mix optimization as a two-stage stochastic program and propose a sample average approximation based heuristic method to solve it. An adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm is used for each operational period to determine the operational decisions and associated costs. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated through two case studies within urban logistics services. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive large neighborhood search; Case studies; Fleet size and mix; Sample average approximation; Stochastic fleet sizing; Vehicle routing problem","algorithm; energy use; heuristics; logistics; optimization; routing; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123258130

For unemployed individuals, the experimental reservation wage increases on average by around one Euro for every Euro increase in the survey measure.

Drawing on 213 interviews with market participants involved in automated trading, this study compares the forms of knowledge risk and principal-agent relations characterizing both human-defined and ML-based automated trading systems. It demonstrates that certain forms of ML-based automated trading lead to a change in knowledge risks, particularly concerning dramatically changing market settings, and that they are characterized by a lack of insight into how and why trading rules are being produced by the ML systems.

The modular offshore wind industry, and in particular an offshore wind project in the British section of the North Sea, faced issues with delivery times, productivity, and uncertainty management (safety and/or pandemic disruptions). The objective of our research was to develop and test a conceptual model that responds to these challenges, which further will increase the likelihood of reducing delays in offshore energy operations. The initial literature review made it evident that few, if any, have covered Takt implementation in modular construction, and certainly not in offshore energy operations. A design science approach was chosen, and in collaboration with the case organization, the model was constructed and evaluated in a longitudinal field study. The application of mixed methods ensured data input originating from practical experience provided by field experts both within and outside the case-study organizations, theoretical knowledge from academics, and state-of-the-art literature allowed the development of a model that embeds Kanban, Takt, and PDCA to the context of modular offshore wind turbine tower construction. After its implementation, a 10% increase in labor productivity was recorded. Furthermore, through the stable productivity measures in a time of crisis, the model revealed its robustness during COVID-19. The contributions to the body of knowledge are the developed model combining Takt, Kanban, and PDCA, and the visual management interface. The model was implemented together with the visual management interface to achieve a flexible planning framework that can respond to challenges with delivery times and productivity and withstand major disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","COVID-19; Design science; Disruptions; Management; Modular construction; Safety","Construction industry; Design; Modular construction; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind turbines; Productivity; Project management; COVID-19; Cycle managements; Delivery time; Design science; Disruption; Kanbans; Modulars; Offshore energy; Plan do check acts; Visual management interface; Accident prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121328287

We specifically study how uncertainty drives relationship strength and contributes to intended future relationship strength in engineering service relationships due to the suitability of this setting for our purpose. From the literature, we derive a conceptual framework of three uncertainty types (environmental, relational and organisational uncertainty), which we investigate over the contract life cycle. We present four case studies of 10–17 semi-structured interviews each and secondary data. We show how pre-contract environmental uncertainty drives relationship strength depending on the pre-contract experienced organisational uncertainty. We further show how relationship strength affect early contract experienced organisational uncertainty.

In sustainability transitions that unfold over long periods of time, the maintenance of legitimacy of technologies identified as vital for sustainability becomes a key challenge. In the energy sector, wind power contributes to the transition to an energy system with low greenhouse gas emissions. In Germany, wind power recently faced a series of lawsuits and decreasing investment activity. Therefore, we assess the legitimacy of wind power in Germany by analyzing newspaper articles from four national newspapers from 2009 to 2018. A large amount of articles motivates the use of topic models, sentiment analysis, and statistics to shed light on the changing alignment of wind power with its context. The results show that various issues temporarily gain prominence on the agenda. Lately, the legitimacy of wind power in Germany has been increasingly challenged by adverse effects on humans, animals, and landscapes. Policymakers and project developers may address aspects of pragmatic legitimacy, such as civic participation and the local distribution of profits. © 2021","Energy transitions; Natural language processing; Structural topic model; Technology legitimacy; text mining; Wind power Germany","Data mining; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Newsprint; Sentiment analysis; Sustainable development; Energy transitions; Modeling analyzes; Public support; Resource flows; Sentiment analysis; Structural topic model; Technology legitimacy; Text-mining; Topic Modeling; Wind power germany; Wind power; alternative energy; emission control; model test; policy making; power generation; profitability; project assessment; technological development; technology adoption; wind power; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119913599

Research concerning the continuance intentions to adopt smart wearable products has received some attention from scholars, but previous studies were more “technology-driven” rather than “consumer-driven” and largely neglected how different configurations (specific combinations of variables) affect users' intentions to continue adopting smart wearable products. This research, which is based on the means-end chain theory, tests the factors affecting the continuance intentions to adopt smart wearable products. Through an analysis of the survey results of 249 smartwatch and fitness wristband users by Mplus and fsQCA, the findings reveal that face consciousness was a strong predictor of users’ perceived value. Three dimensions of social capital had a different positive effect on perceived value. Social, utilitarian, and hedonic value positively affected continuance intention.

Recent years have featured unprecedented growth in the volume and availability of data from diverse national contexts, offering novel opportunities for innovative research. Accordingly, we build on the logic of Welch et al. (2011) not only to elaborate on but also to call for a more pluralistic view of data and methodology. We advocate using a wider range of data and advanced methods in IB research, framed at the appropriate stage of theory development. We examine the interplay among theory, research design, data, and analytical technique, highlighting the role of data in methodological pluralism. While IB scholars have favored confirmatory approaches in deductive theory building, we argue for more exploratory research using both qualitative and quantitative data. We develop a contingency framework that highlights the stages of theory development, across the nexus of exploratory/confirmatory and qualitative/quantitative approaches, to guide empirical scholarship.

For each shipment, the cargo has to be selected from a set of heterogeneous boxes. The goal of the resulting container loading problem (CLP) is to maximize the value of the cargo while satisfying a number of practical constraints to ensure safety and facilitate cargo handling, including customer priorities, load balancing, cargo stability, stacking constraints, positioning constraints, and limiting the number of unnecessary cargo move operations during multi-shipment deliveries. Although some of these constraints have been considered in the literature, this is the first time a problem tackles all of them jointly on real instances. Moreover, differently from the literature, we treat the unnecessary move operations as soft constraints and analyze their trade-off with the value maximization. As a result, the problem is inherently multi-objective and extremely challenging. We tackle it by proposing a randomized constructive heuristic that iteratively combines items in a preprocessing procedure, sorts them based on multiple criteria, uses randomization to partially perturb the sorting, and finally constructs the packing while complying with all the side constraints. We also propose dual bounds based on CLP relaxations. On large-scale industry instances, our algorithm runs in a few seconds and outperforms (in terms of value and constraints handling) both the solutions constructed manually by the company and those provided by a commercial software. The algorithm is currently used by the company generating significant economic and CO2 savings. © 2021","Container loading problem; Industry collaboration; Randomized constructive heuristic; Real-life constraints",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117727437

This article conceptualizes the novel phenomenon and delineates it from other concepts. Moreover, based on two experimental studies and drawing from fairness theory, first evidence is provided for how consumers react to key characteristics of ODFs, namely their tangibility and pricing structure. While intangible, software-based ODFs appear to find acceptance, consumers perceive on-demand access to tangible, hardware-based features as unfair, which explains their reduced purchase intent.

We assume that a dissimilarity between the individuals is given, and propose distance-based explanations, namely those defined by individuals that are close to its so-called prototype. To find the set of prototypes, we address the biobjective optimization problem that maximizes the total number of true positive cases across all clusters and minimizes the total number of false positive cases, while controlling the true positive rate as well as the false positive rate in each cluster. We develop two mathematical optimization models, inspired by classic Location Analysis problems, that differ in the way individuals are allocated to prototypes.

We nuance this general belief by arguing that what matters for an MNE’s competitive advantage is not the employment of multiculturals per se, but rather the MNE’s ability to transform multiculturals’ KSAOs into strategic human capital resources by creating complementarities between KSAOs and emergence-enabling factors. Using a 12-month in-depth ethnographic study over the span of two years in two MNEs, we identified five emergence-enabling factors that enable the transformation of multiculturals’ KSAOs into human capital resources and strategic human capital resources: (1) a global mindset, (2) a differentiated HR architecture, (3) the language policy and practices, (4) team diversity, and (5) multicultural team leadership. We suggested that a global mindset and differentiated HR architecture are emergence-enabling factors that enable the transformation of KSAOs into unit-level strategic human capital resources that are relevant for competitive advantage, while team diversity and multicultural team leadership are emergence-enabling factors that enable the transformation of KSAOs into unit-level human capital resources relevant for performance parity.

With these collaborative repertoires, both the temporal diversities of home organizations and the asynchronies of the network activities were resolved for collective benefit. We contribute to the intersection of the literatures on interorganizational network collaboration and temporality. © The Author(s) 2021.","cloud software; collaboration; ecosystems; field research; interorganizational network formation; research and development; sprints; time horizon/pacing/temporality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114464187

In this study, we are investigating the social networks of self-initiated expatriates, focusing on the process of how they source social support. Building on information seeking theory, we have created a model connecting specific characteristics of network members (host country knowledge, employment status and host country origin) with the frequency of contact and support they provide. The model was tested through multilevel mediation analysis on 165 expatriates and their 575 network members. We contribute to the existing knowledge on expatriate networks by a theoretically driven categorization of network members and a detailed empirical analysis on the level of a relationship/tie. Our results show that expatriates rely on different network members for different types of support. Practical implications include the use of mentors to facilitate expatriate access to higher status individuals who can offer important support. © 2021","Expatriation; Global mobility; HCN; Multilevel; Social support",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113160480

Drawing on the bounded rationality perspective, we unravel new insights into the relationship between the threat from informal competitors and product innovation by identifying two external contingencies (intellectual property rights protection and regulatory quality) and two internal contingencies (export intensity and top manager's sector experience). In this way, the study acknowledges the immense differences that exist across developing markets, focusing on post-communist societies characterized with a medium level of economic development, limited market size, and weak institutional development. An empirical prototype of this type of context is exemplified in EU candidate countries. Therefore, our model estimates the effect of the threat from informal competitors on product innovation by testing firm-level data from five countries with EU candidate status. Our findings show that direct and positive relationship between the threat from informal competitors and product innovation is strengthened when: 1) intellectual property rights protection is weaker, 2) regulatory quality is higher, 3) the firm is an intesive exporter, and 4) the firm's top managers have less experience. © 2021","Export intensity; informal Competition; Product innovation; Regulatory quality; Rule of law; Top management experience","Commerce; Intellectual property; Laws and legislation; Managers; Professional aspects; Bounded rationality; Developing markets; Institutional development; Intellectual property rights protections; Market sizes; Model estimates; Product innovation; Top managers; Competition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111483054

Design/methodology/approach: The survey method is used. It is applied to a population of Danish firms, which in 2018 had more than 100 employees. The chief financial officer was the target respondent. Findings: This study finds that a higher level of ROR is associated with lower levels of downside risk. ROR’s association with lower levels of the downside risk is also moderated by the level of relative exploration orientation in a negative direction. Originality/value: The field of ROR research on downside risk and portfolio subadditivity has been dominated by research focused on multinationality. This paper extends extant literature on ROR by studying ROR as a multidimensional construct of firm action, which is associated with lower levels of downside risk, also when studied outside of a multinationality setting. This is the case when ROR is implemented as a complete system. This paper also applies a framework of exploitation and exploration to show that findings on subadditivity in options portfolios caused by asset correlations extend outside the scope of multinationality and into one of product/service innovation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Capital budgeting; Downside risk; Real options reasoning; Relative exploration orientation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108166584

First, reliance on information and communications technology (ICT) and managerial logics sustains a bounded form of interaction in which solving a problem is the focal point, while access to personal background information is limited. Second, the organizational design suspends sociability as a criterion for differential treatment of users.

We unpack the process of temporal coordination by identifying three temporal coordination mechanisms that enabled parties to address temporal complexities: leveraging serendipitous alignment, temporary exclusion, and aligning on the future. Whereas, prior research has stressed synchronization as a dominant approach to coordination, rooted in a clock-time orientation, these three mechanisms for temporal coordination are rooted in process-time. With a process-time orientation, temporal coordination becomes inherently partial and transient, meaning that temporal complexities may resurface over time and require re-initiation of joint action, building upon emerging outcomes of previous episodes.

The consequences of these third-mission activities for the degree of freedom of the research, the potential to make a substantial research contribution and the ethical challenges of this increased dependency on external funding are often neglected. The implications of external sponsorship of research depend on the level of influence of the sponsor in the various elements of the research.

Through in-depth analysis of nine innovation management research projects, carried out and funded in Northern Europe, and a rich set of qualitative data, the paper outlines the key dimensions of the projects where researchers and practitioners should agree on the degrees of freedom of the research project. It identifies three different methodological dimensions that can impact the likelihood of generating publishable results from the innovation management research. The three dimensions are purpose (e.g. formulating the topic of the research and the research question to pursue), throughput (the possibility of the researcher to decide on the way that the research question should be answered) and output (the expectations of the funding body on the results that should be generated from the innovation management research). The paper discusses the positive and negative impact of these types of projects and generates implications for the central stakeholders. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.","Business ethics; Externally funded research; Research degrees of freedom",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098510853

On the basis of these findings, we argue that (a) the paradox reoccurred throughout the phases of the CSP because the three paradox management practices accentuated boundaries, thereby helping to resolve the paradox temporarily while at the same time creating grounds for the paradox to resurface, and (b) that the three paradox management practices can be theorized as a special type of boundary work that “plays up” relevant differences between actor groups and thereby ensures collaboration. © The Author(s) 2020.","boundary work; climate change; cross-sector partnerships; inclusiveness; paradox",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097595121

To incorporate the existing stochasticity in our dynamic problem, we develop a multi-stage stochastic program to specify the optimal location, capacity, inventory, and allocation decisions. Further, a data-driven rolling horizon approach is developed to use observations of the random parameters in the stochastic optimization problem. In contrast to traditional stochastic programming approaches that are valid only for a limited number of scenarios, the rolling horizon approach makes the determined decisions by the stochastic program implementable in practice and evaluates them. The stochastic program is presented as a quadratic conic optimization, and to generate an efficient scenario tree, a forward scenario tree construction technique is employed. An extensive numerical study is carried out to investigate the applicability of the presented model and rolling horizon procedure, the efficiency of risk-measurement policies, and the performance of the scenario tree construction technique. Several key practical and managerial insights related to the dynamic supply chain network design under uncertainty are gained based on the computational results. © 2020 The Authors.

In addition, we argue that state ownership will weaken the impact of executive power on the concentration of PCIDs.

Such a static place-conception lends itself to a particular instrumental and simplistic way of thinking about places. Instead, this paper seeks to illustrate that places are complex and relationally defined by multiple actors, human as well as non-human. The burning down of the Danish seaside hotel Svinkløv Badehotel is used as a lens through which such place complexity is understood. The paper presents a theoretical scaffolding for understanding how Svinkløv Badehotel became articulated as an authentic place in the wake of the dramatic event. Through a combined analysis of place materiality and public media representation, an account is given of how a disruptive event can work as a productive lens for understanding places and thus illustrate the analytical point of the paper: that places are never “empty,” but are configured by multiple human as well as non-human actors. © The Author(s) 2019.","authentication; disruptive events; place discourses; place materiality; relational place",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074009386

It aims to clarify fundamental theoretical aspects of the development that takes place when practitioners enhance their way of participating in the activity. Pursuing this aim, I draw on the phenomenological description of embodiment processes and argue, that despite differences in the inherent logic and motivation for engaging in different kinds of physical activities, a phenomenologically based understanding of skills constructively helps describe the development acquired through practicing a physical activity. I thereby argue that descriptions of how skills are incorporated and exercised are relevant to analyses of embodied learning processes taking place in sporting as well as non-sporting activities, including recreational mountain-biking, expressive and creative dance activities, and improvisational practices. In continuation of this argument, I also suggest that practitioners' capability to attune to the interactions of the activity contribute yet another theoretical aspect we should consider, when aiming at describing the embodied learning that takes place in different kinds of physical activities. This suggestion finds support in recent work on action and interaction.

In this article, we therefore ask “How can we, based on the insights from the dispersed research studying OC and OL, conceptualize the interrelationship between the two concepts?” Our purpose is to create an overview on the past development path and the current status of research interrelating OL and OC, to use it as basis for the conceptualization of this interrelationship and to identify avenues for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This article utilized a systematic literature review methodology by combining bibliometric and content analysis using relevant articles identified from the Scopus database. A two-stage literature review research approach was employed: (1) Bibliometric analysis was used to identify 416 relevant contributions and to present a comprehensive contextual picture of the interrelations between OL and OC research by analyzing the 162 most relevant articles. (2) A subsequent qualitative content analysis of the 45 most relevant academic contributions detailed and solidified the insights. Findings: We identify four weakly linked thematic clusters on the interrelationship of OC and OL. Based on that, our analysis confirms the theorized bidirectional relationship between OC and OL: OC acts as antecedent, driver and result of OL processes, and OL processes are constrained by and alter OC. We moreover develop three propositions that put knowledge at the center of scholarly attention for understanding this interrelationship in more depth and develop avenues for future research. Practical implications: Our research has important implications for managers as it shows that mastering leadership challenges is central for the success of OL processes and OC change. We moreover specify the leadership challenges that relate to particular types of OL processes. Managers need to take this interrelationship into account when setting out for OL or OC change processes, and carefully reflect on whether or not the decided OL measures fit the given OC, and the other way round. Originality/value: Our contribution to existing research is threefold: It first lies in analytically mapping out the research field, second in conceptualizing the interrelationship between OC and OL and third in identifying open research questions and topics. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis; Organizational culture; Organizational learning; Qualitative literature review",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116412863

System Dynamics (SD) facilitates coping with increased complexity by enabling closed-loop thinking via identifying the causal structures underlying behaviour and permitting to proactively experiment with the system through simulation. This research aims to propose and test an SD-based framework for examining CE transitions to supporting decision-making at the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. Two inductive model-based cases studies led to formalising the framework, finally tested in a third deductive model-based case study. The framework is built upon the well-known stages for building SD simulation models and complemented with domain-specific activities, guiding questions, and expected outcomes when examining CE transitions. The SD-based framework is the first modelling-oriented prescriptive approach to help researchers and practitioners examining CE transitions on their journeys to understand and facilitate changes through SD simulation models. © 2021 The Authors","Circular economy; Policy experimentation; Simulation models; Sustainability transitions; System dynamics","System theory; Case-studies; Circular economy; Decision makers; Dynamic simulation models; Model-based OPC; Policy experimentation; Simulation model; Sustainability transition; System Dynamics; System dynamics simulation; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122382221

In order to overcome the slow natural reaction rates, diverse pathways are studied to sequester carbon dioxide into mineral products. However, studies that perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) on mineral carbonation are poorly comparable due to differences in the assessment methodology. A two-step approach is applied to report on and overcome this issue. First, a qualitative analysis based on a systematic literature review of 29 relevant articles was conducted. Second, a meta analysis with harmonized methodological assumptions was applied to assess which of the proposed ex-situ carbonation routes in literature has the lowest environmental impacts (16 different impact categories assessed). The qualitative literature review demonstrates that the most critical difference of the published LCAs on mineral carbonation technologies is handling multifunctional processes, as this parameter influences the result of an LCA. Since none of the assessed studies evaluated the technology readiness level (TRL) of the investigated technology, a TRL estimation based on the studies' descriptive information, ranging from 2 to 6, was provided. This is reflected in the predominant usage of laboratory or simulated data as the primary data source. The main finding of the meta analysis in terms of global warming and the impact category minerals and metals is that direct aqueous carbonation, carbonation mixing, and carbonation curing show negative values in those impact categories despite the deployed scenario. Hence, these three mineral carbonation technologies seem to be most promising. However, it could be demonstrated that other impact categories show positive results. In the case of indirect aqueous carbonation, it depends on the substitution credit assumed whether this pathway acts as a climate mitigation pathway. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon capture and utilization (CCU); Carbonation; Harmonization; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Literature review; Meta analysis; Mineralization","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Global warming; Life cycle; Minerals; Reaction rates; Aqueous carbonation; Carbon capture and utilization; Harmonisation; Life cycle assessment; Literature reviews; Meta-analysis; Mineral carbonation; Mineralisation; Systematic literature review; Technology readiness levels; Mineralogy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121155056

However, several studies have found that organizations are far from unlocking the full potential of ISM. This paper seeks to explore and explain this gap further by adopting a sensemaking lens to managers' understanding of a social intranet in a public sector organization. Design/methodology/approach: A longitudinal case study of the process of introducing ISM was conducted in a Danish municipality. Before, during and after the launch of the intranet, interviews with department heads and communication managers in the six different municipal departments were carried out to explore how they made sense of the purpose of ISM. Findings: Findings indicate that during the process of introducing and implementing ISM, department heads' and managers' narratives about the purpose of the intranet changed from being a matter of involving, engaging and hearing the voices of the employees to being an effective administrative tool and a channel for management to reach all employees. Originality/value: Rather than the traditional focus on whether ISM fail or succeed, the paper offers new understandings of how managers' sensemaking of ISM changes over time, leading to changes in the actual usage of and communication on ISM. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Employee communication; Internal social media; Participation; Public sector organization; Social intranet; Strategic communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111161478

Therefore, this paper proposes an on-grid hybrid hydrogen refueling and battery swapping station powered by wind energy. This novel concept can promote the development of low-carbon emission vehicles including hydrogen-based vehicle and battery electric vehicle. During the daily operation of the station, the multiple uncertainties may lead to a higher operational cost. To address this problem, a hybrid stochastic/distributionally robust optimization method is proposed to handle different uncertainties for the energy management problem. The first type of uncertainties can be depicted by a certain distribution, i.e. electricity price and wind power, which is processed by a stochastic optimization method. The second type of uncertainties is associated with human behaviors and is difficult to find its probability distribution, i.e. the hydrogen demand of hydrogen-based vehicles, so the second type is processed by a distributionally robust optimization method. The overall objective is to minimize the total operational cost of the station, which also considers the battery swapping station overstock punishment. Because a reasonable battery swapping scheduling can reduce the waiting time of users and operational cost of the station. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively address the conservatism of solutions as its total operational cost is 4.4% lower than that of the hybrid stochastic/robust optimization method under a high confidence level. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Battery electric vehicle; Energy management; Hybrid hydrogen refueling/battery swapping station; Hybrid stochastic/distributionally robust optimization; Hydrogen-based vehicle; Renewable energy","Behavioral research; Energy management; Hybrid vehicles; Optimization; Probability distributions; Secondary batteries; Wind power; Battery swapping; Battery-electric vehicles; Hybrid hydrogen refueling/battery swapping station; Hybrid stochastic/distributionally robust optimization; Hydrogen refueling; Hydrogen-based vehicle; Renewable energies; Robust optimization; Stochastics; Uncertainty; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120694176

The field work based on mixed methods combined 20 qualitative interviews with a survey to 277 Danish certified organizations. Findings show that the key stakeholders for EMSs - namely, employees and customers - are rarely involved to set the environmental objectives, as top managers in collaboration with environmental managers set them. Objectives within the areas of energy/climate, waste, and water consumption are the most common ones, while the least used ones deal with biodiversity, lifecycle assessments and design. Thus, the rather operational focus of the EMSs is highlighted.

Design/methodology/approach: The research follows a design science research approach. Following the case of I4.0 technology introduction at a large food manufacturer, the paper develops a theoretical framework (artefact) and validates the applicability and efficacy of the framework within the case study. Findings: The theoretical framework highlights the different temporal (short-term/long-term) and locational (direct/indirect) value dimensions of I4.0 opportunities. The findings show that the use of the framework can shift managers’ perception regarding the business value of an I4.0 technology implementation. Specifically, the framework reversed initially negative perceptions around a narrowly scoped business case towards an opportunity-oriented attitude exploring further potentials of the technology. Research limitations/implications: The research adds to the debate when and why firms engage in, and sustain their I4.0 initiatives by providing a novel perspective on firms’ sensing capabilities.

Design/methodology/approach: This conceptual paper seeks to foster the debate on the crucial role of risk reporting considering the impact and uncertainty caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and stakeholder information needs in this context. The authors draw upon neo-Durkheimian institutional and legitimacy theories and elements of the accounting and risk management literature to discuss the challenges that the pandemic poses to risk recognition and assessment and the subsequent disclosure decision of risk information. Findings: Risk reporting has its roots in risk recognition and assessment. To live up to their accountability in these times of uncertainty, organisations need to address their stakeholders' new and changing information needs. Ad hoc disclosures and linking risk management and reporting to their business models (BM) would improve the risk recognition and assessment practices and the meaningfulness of the disclosed information. Hence, we provide some examples and discuss potential avenues to address these challenges and adapt risk reporting accordingly.

Innovation management strategies often include attempts of stimulating employees' innovative contribution by instilling managerial trust and granting job autonomy. However, the authors suggest and investigate the role of employees' distributed leadership agency (DLA) in hospital employee-driven innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the hypotheses using survey data from 1,536 nonmanagerial employees at a hospital in Denmark. In order to deal with a methodological risk of survey designs, the authors assessed and adjusted the results for common method variance (CMV). Findings: The authors validated a DLA measurement instrument and found an indirect relationship between job autonomy and trust in management on the one hand, via DLA, and with idea generation, promotion and implementation on the other hand. In addition, the results showed a small direct relationship between job autonomy and the three innovative behaviors. The results showed that CMV did bias relationships and reliabilities but only little. Practical implications: The study introduces distributed leadership to the field of innovation management and confirms that this concept is highly relevant for employee innovation. In order to strengthen an organization's innovative potential, leaders may not only need to grant autonomy and instill trust in their employees, but also gain from employee innovation by distributing leadership tasks to employees. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to introduce distributed leadership to the field of employee innovation management. By identifying distributed leadership as a key variable, the findings add to one’s extant understanding of how employee involvement encourages employee innovation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Distributed leadership; Employee involvement; Employee-driven innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093660360

They can also trigger significant changes in structure, shape and governance models of supply chains. The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of supply chain intermediation and digital governance as coordinating mechanisms for enabling multi-level collective action to address the world's grand challenges. Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual research paper that uses a vignette approach, where real examples are described to help question and expand theoretical insights and provide a basis for future research. The examples are drawn from past and ongoing extensive primary and secondary data collection efforts in diverse types of supply chains. Findings: Three contexts are proposed to illustrate how intermediaries and digital governance can play a key role in helping supply chains tackle grand challenges. The first and second context highlight the differences between material and support flow intermediaries in a triadic supply chain relationship. The third context illustrates intermediation within a multi-level network which can be industry-specific or span across industries. The three contexts are evaluated on the level of intervention, the focus on material or support flows, and traditional or digital governance. The specific Sustainable Development Goals which can be tackled through intermediary intervention are also indicated. Originality/value: Intermediaries are often hidden actors in global supply chains and have received limited attention in the academic literature. The conceptual foundation provided in this manuscript serves as the basis for future research opportunities.

We focus on corporate tax transparency, which has become an important battleground as stakeholders increasingly demand more information on corporate tax practices. While the Big 4 global accounting firms have traditionally played a dominant role in shaping what is perceived as acceptable corporate tax behavior, activists and critical politicians have recently mobilized public attention, challenging how accounting professionals legitimate their practices. We provide evidence of these challenges from 33 interviews and participation in 13 professional events from 2013 to 2019. We conceive of the confrontation between dominant professionals and challengers as taking place in a transnational “field,” where a range of actors struggle over how a common object—corporate tax transparency—is defined and treated. This approach helps us understand how the Big 4 navigate new challenges while seeking to maintain control over professional practices. Our interviews and observations show that Big 4 professionals are sensitive to political challenges, requiring that they engage in what we characterize as “scanning work”—ongoing activity to search for, identify, and assess challenges—to fend off outside interventions. Our analysis has important implications for further research. First, the need for scanning work when facing transnational political pressure implies a different way of seeing interactions between accounting professionals and (global) society at large. Second, viewing global accounting from a transnational field lens helps us identify complex sources of change external to already-powerful actors. © 2022 The Authors.

It also aims to identify the social and technical capabilities needed by the service providers for blockchain implementation and how those capabilities vary between the projects. To achieve the above mentioned objectives, a multiple case study approach is followed, and data are collected from the service providers that have implemented blockchain technology with their customers. We conduct task-technology fit (TTF) analysis to assess the suitability of blockchain to address the tasks to be completed, considering customer needs. The TTF analysis shows that some additional technological solutions related to communication support and user experience design need to be implemented together with the blockchain platform. We then identify common social and technical capabilities, such as empathising with customers and system design, to facilitate implementation and contingent capabilities that vary across different types of blockchain implementation projects. We also develop a process model, a generalisable framework for blockchain implementation and related propositions.

This poses a challenge for marketers because negative properties not only weigh heavily on consumers' technology adoption decisions but potentially do more so than positive ones. To shed light on the paradox of technology and its underlying processes, the present research develops a conceptual model drawing on technology adoption and valence perception theories about the prevalence of negativity bias in consumers' technology adoption decisions with its unique effect through the serial chain of consumers' perceptions of risk and trust regarding the technology. Results of three studies (N = 1309) demonstrate that the effect of negative valence consistently outperforms that of positive valence in consumers' technology adoption intentions (Studies 1–2) and decisions (Study 3). Furthermore, results show that the disproportionate effect of negative (vs. positive) valence can be explained by the proposed serial causal chain through consumers' perception of risk of the technology and trust in the technology (Studies 2–3) while ruling out company trust and consumer knowledge as alternative drivers of the effects (Study 3). These findings contribute to the pertinent literature on consumer psychology in decisions to adopt novel technologies in that they quantify and explain the potential outcome stemming from the ambiguous properties of novel technology. Moreover, this study finds negativity bias to be an often overlooked consumer bias with implications for marketing practice and useful for understanding and lowering resistance towards artificial intelligence technology. © 2022 The Authors.

While these effects have been examined in small private firms, they have been relatively unexplored in the context of public service organizations.

Design/methodology/approach: This ethnographic inquiry has explored the methodological considerations and actions taken in a project collaboration using a framework of co-productive research approaches and the science- and technology-inspired concept of staging. Findings: Three trajectories of inquiry, a roadmap, a theoretical model and a conceptual drawing, are shown to be important elements in the translation, operationalisation and dissemination of knowledge. Beyond creating an extended network, their trajectories reveal a fine-meshed interrelation within the project group that enables spaces for joint reflection, improvisation and resonance.

Specifically, this research relied on person-centered analyses to gain a better understanding of how the distinct components of psychological need states (satisfaction, frustration, and unfulfillment of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) combine to produce distinct profiles of employees. We also documented the stability of these profiles over time and their associations with theoretically-relevant predictors (supervisors’ supportive, thwarting, and indifferent behaviors) and outcomes (work motivation). Questionnaire surveys were completed twice over the course of three months by a sample of 590 French employees. Six profiles, characterized by distinct configurations of global and specific need constructs were identified and found to be stable over time. Supervisors’ supportive, thwarting, and indifferent behaviors showed well-differentiated patterns of association with these profiles. Finally, employees’ global levels of self-determination and specific levels of motivational regulations differed as a function of profile membership. Altogether, results from this research suggest that SDT’s explanatory framework may be expanded to encompass the key role played by need indifferent behaviors and employees’ experiences of need unfulfillment. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis.","Interpersonal behaviours; psychological needs; Self-Determination theory; work motivation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139770055

However, this mission remains an elusive ideal for many business school academics as they struggle to overcome the research-practice gap. To help scholars bridge this gap, we present social media as a boundary-spanning technology to be open to connecting with, learning from and working with academics and other stakeholders outside their field. Social media can be used as a boundary-spanning technology to help bridge the research-practice gap. To support this idea, we present a process model of five research activities—networking, framing, investigating, disseminating, and assessing—and describe how social media can make each activity more open. We present a framework of four social media-enabled open academic approaches—connector, observer, promoter, and influencer—and outline some do's and don'ts for engaging in each approach. We also discuss the potential dark side of openness through social media and offer some coping strategies.

Therefore, as educators, we need to devise new ways to rebalance benefits and deficits in our classrooms. Complementing critical work on privilege in business schools that has exposed and theorized the problem, we take a practical, By design approach to addressing privilege while avoiding diversity education dilemmas. We propose that such a proactive rather than reactive approach can help mitigate the negative consequences that the exercise of privilege may have on our students’ learning. Specifically, we propose that we can learn from designers how to use tools that help create collaborative, positive-sum environments when conducting team-based activities in the classroom. We present a selection of simple yet powerful design devices: Speaking rules, Problem framing, and Iteration. We discuss how these devices may help address privilege in the classroom with illustrative examples and reflections on the outcomes and limitations of these devices.

This also means a renewed interest in state-owned enterprises. The public turn takes place in the public administration literature via growing recognition of the inherently public nature of much infrastructure in terms of financing, ownership and maintenance. We suggest that this public turn calls for a move from dominant performance studies of public-private partnerships as an organizational form to a broader research focus based on an institutional theoretical perspective on infrastructure governance. This transition has happened through a gradual institutionalized process during the last decade. The OECD's change in policy approach from partnerships to infrastructure governance is used an illustration. This policy change matters because there is now room for governments to adopt a more pragmatic interest in finding solutions to governing infrastructure rather than debates about what is public and what is private. © Graeme A.

In addition, despite the short research period, numerous scientific publications tackling the resilience of supply chains can already be found.

One challenge has been finding ways to credibly compare the costs of engaging in market transactions with governments versus firms. In this paper, we systematically compare the costs of contracting when governments and firms buy the same product under the same circumstances. Using data from a randomized experiment of Danish firms, we examine selling firms' transaction cost expenditures when selling the same product to governments and other firms. We find that firms estimate spending about 34 percent more on transaction cost expenditures when selling to governments than when selling the same product to firms.

This essay comprises a selection of commentaries aimed at creating dialogue around the theme Ethics at the centre of global and local challenges. For much of the history of the Journal of Business Ethics, ethics was seen within the academy as a peripheral aspect of business. However, in recent years, the stakes have risen dramatically, with global and local worlds destabilized by financial crisis, climate change, internet technologies and artificial intelligence, and global health crises. The authors of these commentaries address these grand challenges by placing business ethics at their centre. What if all grand challenges were framed as grand ethical challenges? Tanusree Jain, Arno Kourula and Suhaib Riaz posit that an ethical lens allows for a humble response, in which those with greater capacity take greater responsibility but remain inclusive and cognizant of different voices and experiences. Focussing on business ethics in connection to the grand(est) challenge of environmental emergencies, Steffen Böhm introduces the deceptively simple yet radical position that business is nature, and nature is business. His quick but profound side-step from arguments against human–nature dualism to an ontological undoing of the business–nature dichotomy should have all business ethics scholars rethinking their “business and society” assumptions. Also, singularly concerned with the climate emergency, Boudewijn de Bruin posits a scenario where, 40 years from now, our field will be evaluated by its ability to have helped humanity emerge from this emergency. He contends that Milieudefensie (Friends of the Earth) v. Royal Dutch Shell illustrates how human rights take centre stage in climate change litigation, and how business ethics enters the courtroom. From a consumer ethics perspective, Deirdre Shaw, Michal Carrington and Louise Hassan argue that ecologically sustainable and socially just marketplace systems demand cultural change, a reconsideration of future interpretations of “consumer society”, a challenge to the dominant “growth logic” and stimulation of alternative ways to address our consumption needs. Still concerned with global issues, but turning attention to social inequalities, Nelarine Cornelius links the capability approach (CA) to global and corporate governance, arguing that CA will continue to lie at the foundation of human development policy, and, increasingly, CSR and corporate governance. Continuing debate on the grand challenges associated with justice and equality, Laurence Romani identifies a significant shift in the centrality of business ethics in debates on managing (cultural) differences, positing that dialogue between diversity management and international management can ground future debate in business ethics. Finally, the essay concludes with a commentary by Charlotte Karam and Michelle Greenwood on the possibilities of feminist-inspired theories, methods, and positionality for many spheres of business ethics, not least stakeholder theory, to broaden and deepen its capacity for nuance, responsiveness, and transformation. In the words of our commentators, grand challenges must be addressed urgently, and the Journal of Business Ethics should be at the forefront of tackling them. © 2022, The Author(s).","Capability approach; Climate change; Consumer ethics; Cultural differences; Feminism; Grand challenges; Inequality",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139392430

We draw on two illustrative cases: independent female filmmakers in Nairobi, Kenya, and independent female fashion designers in Toronto, Canada, with a combined 69 interviews. Taking a comparative, intersectional approach, we explore both the practices and narratives that entrepreneurial creative workers construct. In doing so, we contribute to ongoing conceptual debates regarding the contemporary nature of work in creative industries. We define hustling in the creative industries as entrepreneurially navigating precarity to build and sustain creative businesses. We argue that hustling is not merely a “stage” of work and life to be moved past or overcome, but instead an ongoing, entrepreneurial creative practice. This fact has implications for how we think about success and creative work: hustling is not a deviation from the good life, but a way of making a good life in precarious circumstances. © 2022 The Authors.

Based on a preregistered systematic literature review, we find 548 effect sizes from 50 quantitative studies by screening more than 12,000 potentially eligible studies. Our meta-regression analyses show that specialist managers have a statistically significant small average advantage on field-specific performance compared to other managers, and that generalist managers have a statistically significant small average advantage on financial performance compared to other managers.

However, studies have shown that making experts share knowledge in new product development (NPD) projects is often a challenging task. Consequently, this topic has attracted substantial attention in academic research. However, although studies have produced valuable insights, more detailed accounts of the mechanisms shaping knowledge sharing processes in NPD projects are sparse. To add to the knowledge on this topic, this study conducts a series of interviews with NPD professionals at manufacturers of high-tech industrial products to identify ‘factors influencing knowledge sharing’ (FIKS). The identified FIKS are explained through the socio-physiological theory, the ‘reasoned action approach’ (RAA). This involves several contributions. First, the study provides a detailed explanation of the role of FIKS by describing how they affect the behaviour of knowledge providers and receivers in NPD processes. Second, by identifying 161 FIKS in NPD processes, organised under 18 categories, the study offers the so far most extensive account of FIKS in NPD processes. Third, the findings suggest a special characteristic of knowledge sharing in NPD contexts concerning the relatively high importance of knowledge receiver behaviour. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","factors influencing knowledge sharing; high-tech products; knowledge sharing; knowledge sharing barriers; New product development; reasoned action approach","Manufacture; Product development; Factor influencing knowledge sharing; High tech; High-tech products; Knowledge sharing barrier; Knowledge-sharing; New product development; New product development process; Reasoned action approach; Knowledge management",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139207399

Design/methodology/approach: Data are from the representative harmonized cross-sectional World Values Survey. Descriptive measures and regression approaches are applied. Different dimensions of perceptions about female emancipation are presented, while also a composite index derived from these dimensions is analysed. Findings: There was some change for the better (job and education gender equality), but not uniformly across countries, e.g. generally good development in Egypt and Iraq, but a standstill in Jordan, and backsliding was seen in Morocco. Applying the composite index of female emancipation using regressions confirm these results – even when male and female respondents are analysed separately. Research limitations/implications: More Arab nations in the study would have been good such that the extent and consequences for an even larger part of the Arab world could be presented. Unfortunately, these data are not available. This implies that the representativeness of the results for the whole of the Arab world is perhaps reduced. Practical implications: The results can inform policymakers and non-governmental organizations, etc., regarding areas where more focus is needed such that women’s rights will not merely be statements on paper but also mean that females are also emancipated in practice.

This study aims to present and critically evaluate the theoretical and empirical basis of goal-framing theory, which asserts that pro-environmental behaviours might stem from conflicting goals. This study compares the theory to other approaches used to explain pro-environmental behaviour, reviews the empirical evidence for it and comes up with suggestions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This study compares the theory with other popular theories to explain pro-environmental behaviour and behaviour change and systematically review 25 empirical research studies that adopt the goal-framing theory. Findings: Most studies rely on survey data, focus on Europe and gather self-reported behaviours or hypothetical responses. Furthermore, many studies of goal frames neglect key situational factors. Thus, the directions for further research outlined herein emphasise the need for more experimental studies of real behaviours, with consideration of situational factors, using methods that can explicate unconscious processes too. Overall, goal-framing theory provides a promising approach for analysing pro-environmental behaviours, in that it explicitly deals with goal conflicts, takes situational factors into account and encompasses conscious and unconscious processes. The authors conclude that the theory can form a useful basis for the design of social marketing behavioural interventions to promote pro-environmental behaviours. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, as the first systematic review of empirical applications of goal-framing theory, this study provides refinement and validation. By also offering propositions and a research agenda, the authors hope to inspire researchers in social marketing to address the remaining gaps and refine the theory even further. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Goal-framing theory; Motivation; Pro-environmental behaviour; Systematic literature review; Theory-based review",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139195210

We find that firms benefit from revising the transfer price based on realized cost instead of keeping it fixed for both periods. Moreover, optimally balancing trade and investment efficiency requires that the firm commits ex ante to a transfer price that does not fully use the information contained in past cost observations to update expected costs in future periods. © 2022 European Accounting Association.","Commitment; Long-term investments; Multi-period model; Transfer pricing",,Note,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139154288

This study also uses the global financial crisis as an arguably exogenous shock on overall risk in the economy to investigate its effect on managers' joint use of textual risk disclosures and earnings smoothing. Findings: This study finds that risk disclosure and earnings smoothing are negatively associated. This finding supports that managers with incentives to mask the firm’s true underlying risk through smoothing earnings provide lower levels of risk-related disclosures. This study documents that the trade-off between risk disclosure and earnings smoothing is more pronounced during the global financial crisis period than before and after the crisis period. Further, this study demonstrates a more negative association for firms with higher volatility of cash flows. This negative association is robust to various model specifications, additional corporate governance related controls and an alternative measure of earnings smoothing.

We empirically validate the enterpriseness scale using a sample of 451 business families. Results indicate high levels of validity and reliability. The two subscales decision-making ability (six items) and business family identity (four items) offer a methodically rigorous, theoretically sound, and parsimonious measure. The article presents opportunities for potential applications of the enterpriseness concept and scale for family business as well as business family research and practice. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Business family; Business family identity; Decision-making ability; Enterpriseness; Family governance; Family sociology; Family success; Scale development",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139046915

The key to success has been a private limited liability company in a cross-sectoral partnership between investors from private businesses, the city and third sector organizations. We analyzed business investors motives through a lens of philanthropy, human geography, and social sustainability. We find that investors see their investment as philanthropic, but that traditional motives behind philanthropy are insufficient to describe all motives behind the investment. Instead, we find that investors sense of place, place attachment and city pride was strongly affected by the contested city image in the outside world and a key to their involvement in the project.

The focus is on a nationwide news media and online news communication related to a smoldering crisis running in the Danish healthcare system since 2016: the problematic implementation of a large-scale electronic health record (EHR), technology entitled Sundhedsplatformen (SP), in the hospitals of the capital region of Denmark. Design/methodology/approach: Based on insights from crisis communication theories and in particular rhetorical arena theory (RAT), traces of SP smoldering crisis and patterns of discursive strategies are identified and explained from a longitudinal perspective to explain the communicative complexity that characterizes this smoldering crisis. To build an understanding of how this smoldering crisis is perceived, followed and kept alive, an analysis of (de)legitimation discursive strategies employed strategically by various actors and voices in news articles is conducted in relation to four communicative themes: issue identification, warnings, blame attribution and potential solutions. Findings: It has been found that a legitimacy deficit emerges communicatively through specific (de)legitimation strategies during this smoldering crisis. New insights into RAT (Frandsen and Johansen, 2017) are also provided.

However, people are often involved in conflicting social commitments in which transparency to one trustor may violate the trust of others. Georg Simmel suggests that secrecy can serve important social purposes; consequently, strategically balancing transparency and secrecy can be conducive to social cooperation and building intersubjective trust. This is particularly the case for trusted intermediaries tasked with building trust in multiple conflicting relations. In this study, we investigate how shop stewards actively navigate the transparency–secrecy nexus as trusted intermediaries to build trust and gain maximal influence over management decisions. The study is based on qualitative interviews with 29 shop stewards within the Danish care sector. Shop stewards depend on co-worker trust and transparency, whereas their influence on management requires secrecy and trust, which makes shop stewards vulnerable to criticism and mistrust from their co-workers. This study shows that transparency and secrecy are important trust work tools for creating and maintaining trust, processes that require efficient compartmentalisation of issues, roles, and contextual meaning in separate formal and informal spaces of collaboration with management to avoid co-worker suspicion or conflict with management. © 2022 Peter Ping Li.","industrial relations; organisation; secrets and secrecy; shop steward; transparency; Trust; trust intermediaries; trust work",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138800908

Liberal democracies are characterized by, e.g., the rule of law and a strong protection of civil rights, giving individuals a great deal of legally guaranteed freedom to lead their lives as they see fit. However, it is not known whether legal freedom suffices to make people satisfied with freedom. Our study explores that issue by relating seven indicators of legal freedom to the satisfaction people express with their freedom of choice. Using a sample of 133 countries over the period 2008–2018, and taking a panel-data approach, we find no robust baseline relationship. However, when exploring conditional associations by interacting the indicators with social trust, the rule of law is positively and increasingly related to satisfaction with freedom above and below a threshold level. Freedom of assembly is more positive for satisfaction with freedom the higher the GDP per capita and in democracies. Thus, for some types of legal freedom, formal legal institutions are complementary with culture, income and the political system in generating satisfaction with freedom. © 2022, The Author(s).","Civil rights; Freedom; Happiness; Rule of law; Satisfaction; Well-being",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138786365

Design/methodology/approach: Case approach and with emphasis on communicative events. Findings: The finding of three different time bindings in strategy work showing not only how time is unfolded and multiplied but also how these bindings were unexpectedly found to be experienced simultaneously, thus turning a seemingly linear strategy based on goal achievement into a complex of interrelated motions driven by performativity, potentiality and reiteration. Research limitations/implications: The research implications are significant to the process perspective on strategy as time should not only be understood and investigated as different unfoldings and time-links within organizations, but also on the motion of these temporal spaces, which is to say, how they move the organization ahead. Practical implications: From a practical perspective, when taking both the existing and future research on strategy into account, one notices that most management literature and the mainstream courses held at business schools tend to draw on one-dimensional casualities and chronological timelines in order to combine accurate forecasts with predicted end-results. Such attempts reflect one unfolding, one binding, one temporal space and one way of moving, but if managers want to improve knowledge on deliberate change, temporal awareness should be part of their strategic change repertoire alongside the ability to match different motions to the skills and capacity of an organization. Social implications: The concept of time binding is a way to extend the ways by which we seek to comprehend the temporal nature of social relations and structures within organizations and in particular those practices that are considered strategic.

The authors use the case of the NOMA cheeseburger from the iconic New Nordic restaurant NOMA. Design/methodology/approach: The data set consists of interviews (n = 20) with urban Danish consumers attending the NOMA burger pop-up. Findings: The analysis highlights an acceptance among informants of “gourmetfied” burgers. This signals a change in the culinary status of burgers in Danish food culture. The authors also discovered some ambivalence in relation to the highbrow-lowbrow negotiations: while all informants celebrate the casualization of NOMA during the burger pop-up, half of the informants found the burger underwhelming: it did not live up to the edginess of the NOMA brand. Practical implications: The authors believe this research can inform people working with culinary highbrow-lowbrow mix in their food designs, notably in relation to developing and matching the relation between symbolic and material aspects of the food design. Originality/value: The authors argue that the concept of transgression can help us theorize how consumers accept, refuse, and negotiate boundaries in relation to gourmet burgers, and more generally between food consumption mixing highbrow and lowbrow elements. More particularly, the authors propose to distinguish between symbolic, social, and material transgressions. This perspective might also be interesting for practitioners in the field. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Burgers; Cultural capital; Highbrow; Junk food; Lowbrow; New Nordic; NOMA; Omnivorousness","ambivalence; article; clinical article; consumer; food intake; human; junk food; negotiation; physician",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138408215

Based on a multiple-case study, we show how and why orchestrators are leveraging different configurations of complementarities depending on, amongst others, competition on ecosystem or value proposition level and uncertainty and the resulting challenges for the orchestrator.

This is enabled by algorithms called consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-work is the most prominent consensus mechanism, but environmentally unsustainable. Here, we focus on proof-of-stake, its best-known alternative. Importantly, decentralised decision-making power is not an inherent feature of blockchain systems, but a technological possibility. Numerous security incidents illustrate that decentralised control cannot be taken for granted. We therefore study how key parameters affect the degree of decentralisation in proof-of-stake blockchain systems. Based on a real-world implementation of a proof-of-stake blockchain system, we conduct agent-based simulations to study how a range of parameters impact decentralisation. The results suggest that high numbers of initial potential validator nodes, large transactions, a high number of transactions, and a very high or very low positive validator network growth rate increase decentralisation. We find weak support for an impact of changes in transaction fees and initial stake distributions. Our study highlights how blockchain challenges our understanding of decentralisation in information systems research, and contributes to understanding the governance mechanisms that lead to decentralisation in proof-of-stake blockchain systems as well as to designing proof-of-stake blockchain systems that are prone to decentralisation and therefore more secure. © The Operational Research Society 2022.","Blockchain; centralisation; consensus mechanism; decentralisation; decision-making power; governance","Blockchain; Decentralized control; Growth rate; Agent based simulation; Block-chain; Centralisation; Consensus mechanism; Decentralisation; Decision-making power; Decisions makings; Governance; Power; Simulation approach; Decision making",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138359889

We further analyse how this organisational text shapes the authority relationships that managers engage in in their leadership practice. The article demonstrates how the unitarist organisational text fails in authorising participating managers as it clashes with the plurality of perspectives and interests in the organisation and is not recognised as a source of authority by employees and collaborators. © The Author(s) 2022.","Authorisation; authority; communicative constitution of organisations; critical leadership studies; leadership development; management development; organisational text; polyphonic organisations; relational leadership",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138315126

During the pandemic, many governments made health their top priority and imposed restrictions that harmed some business interests. By doing so, they demonstrated both a willingness and an ability to prioritise other goals than economic growth, and post-pandemic this may lead to prioritising other of the UN SDGs. This study contributes to the existing literature with the suggestion that firms will be motivated to engage in diplomacy when economy is not the sole priority for governments and governments have demonstrated the strength and willingness to impose restrictions on business.

Design/methodology/approach: This study develops a multi-perspective framework that integrates the ownership, location and internalization (OLI) paradigm (Dunning and Lundan, 2008) and the linkage, leverage and learning (LLL) model (Mathews, 2006) with neo-institutional theory to explain the internationalization of EBGs. It adopts a multiple-case study research method relying on 14 semi-structured interviews with top executives to explore the internationalization strategy of a set of Turkish BGs. Findings: This study supports the combination of the OLI paradigm, the LLL model and neo-institutional theory to explain EBGs’ internationalizing behaviors. Turkish BGs have adopted both asset exploitation and asset augmentation internationalization strategies. The institutional legitimacy mechanism moderates the internationalization motives of Turkish BGs, and their host country location choice and normative pressures are more salient than their regulative and cognitive pressures.

To help prevent this potential failure, we make design recommendations that draw on resourcing theory to complement the limited—or partial—organizing capabilities of HERA. The design recommendations are tailored to three schemas that the analysis of the stakeholder feedback suggests: stability, agility, and evolvability. We outline HERA’s current actions and deliverables as mandated in its founding and suggest additional examples of ways to amplify crisis preparedness and emergency response.

Personas are a central user-centered design technique that puts people before technology and helps decision makers understand the needs and wants of the end-user segments of their products, systems, and services. However, it is not clear how ready organizations are to adopt persona thinking. To address these concerns, we develop and validate the Persona Readiness Scale (PRS), a survey instrument to measure organizational readiness for personas. After a 12-person qualitative pilot study, the PRS was administered to 372 professionals across different industries to examine its reliability and validity, including 125 for exploratory factor analysis and 247 for confirmatory factor analysis. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit with five dimensions: Culture readiness, Knowledge readiness, Data and systems readiness, Capability readiness, and Goal readiness. Higher persona readiness is positively associated with the respondents’ evaluations of successful persona projects. Organizations can apply the resulting 18-item scale to identify areas of improvement before initiating costly persona projects towards the overarching goal of user-centric product development. Located at the cross-section of information systems and human–computer interaction, our research provides a valuable instrument for organizations wanting to leverage personas towards more user-centric and empathetic decision making about users. © 2022, The Author(s).","Human-centered IT; Human–computer interaction; Personas; Survey instrument; User empathy",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138123466

Scholars are increasingly interested in the commercialization of such emerging technologies, existing studies have worked to identify the actors, dynamics, and contexts conducive to successful commercialization efforts. However, collecting and organizing the findings of these studies has been challenging as they cover a broad spectrum of technologies and have significant differences among them. To address this challenge, the present study reviews existing research on the commercialization of emerging technologies by taking the technology view, explicitly considering the technologies’ shared and distinctive attributes. We have conducted a systematic literature review covering 154 articles published in 43 journals over 28 years and structured the results around the distinct factors that allow emerging technologies to help generate innovation. Our analysis differentiates between proprietary and generic technologies to explain how new entrants and incumbents take emerging technologies to market, with substantially different paths to generating technology-based innovations. Ultimately, we use this technological heterogeneity as a lens to better understand the factors and dynamics behind how emerging technologies are commercialized and used as drivers of future innovation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Emerging technologies; Incumbents; Technology commercialization; Technology innovation","Engineering research; Broad spectrum; Emerging technologies; Incumbent; Market uncertainty; Proprietary technologies; Systematic literature review; Technological uncertainty; Technology commercializations; Technology innovation; Commerce",Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85138060023

Yet business models are not only about value and how it is created. They are also key to understanding how organisations create outcomes for stakeholders and impact the natural environment and society. So far, however, business model studies have paid little attention to the conceptual differences and particularities of outcomes, impacts and value. This prevailing vagueness is critical. Lacking an understanding of how organisations create outcomes and impacts while aiming to create value with and for their stakeholders can harm both communities and the organisations involved, despite their best intentions. Hence, this article clarifies the differences between business model outcomes, impacts and value and offers an activity system theory-based framework to map and analyse business models. Using the example of TOMS, this article shows how changes in a business model's activity system influence the outcomes, impacts and value it creates. Finally, we argue that a stakeholder perspective is necessary but insufficient to understand the system-level impacts of business models and that it needs to be complemented with a systems theory lens. © 2022 The Authors.

Derivatives dealers and their frequent counterparties enter into master netting agreements (MNAs) that provide a limited right of setoff that is insufficient (sufficient) for net presentation under IFRS (US GAAP). To remedy this presentation difference, as of 2013, IFRS and US GAAP require dealers to disclose the gross, reported, and net amounts of derivatives assets and liabilities that they present net or present gross but cover under enforceable MNAs. We first study real effects of these mandatory disclosures on dealers’ financial leverage. We posit that dealers prefer market participants to view their leverage as lower. Because the 2013 requirements provide new information for IFRS dealers but not for US GAAP dealers, we hypothesize and show that the requirements induce IFRS dealers to reduce their derivatives leverage by eliminating unnecessary offsetting derivatives and using MNAs more effectively. We hypothesize and show that the requirements have substantially weaker real effects for US GAAP dealers. We then study the usefulness of the disclosures to market participants. Because the right of setoff provided by MNAs does not eliminate all significant risks of the covered derivatives, we hypothesize and provide evidence that dealers’ net derivatives leverage and disclosure quality under the 2013 requirements inform market participants about dealers’ credit risk uncertainty. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Credit risk uncertainty; Dealers; Derivatives; Disclosure; G130; G21; Gross versus net balance sheet presentation; M41; Master netting agreements; Real effects",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137922639

Technical drivers are of strategic importance and product innovativeness and social drivers are of intrinsic and extrinsic relevance. Organic communication is defined as continuous, bidirectional and informal communication between top management and the NPD teams. Further, arguing that TMI must be studied as a multifaceted construct, it is conceptualized to occur as guidance, active motivation and providing resources and creating a tolerant climate. Subsequently, the effect of TMI and organic communication on NPD performance is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The data set, collected via surveys from top managers and project managers involved in 86 NPD projects in 85 firms, is analyzed using PLS structural equation modeling. Findings: The authors show that the strategic importance of the project has a positive influence on TMI through active motivation, providing resources and creating a tolerant climate for innovation, but does not have an effect on guidance. Results also show that active motivation and organic communication improve budget and schedule adherence, whereas providing guidance and stimulating a tolerant climate have detrimental effects. In summary, the results show that only active motivation enhances all types of performance while stimulating a tolerant climate appears to have the opposite effect. The results revealed that organic communication between top management and the NPD team has a strong positive effect on all elements of TMI (providing guidance, actively motivating the NPD team, providing resources and creating a tolerant climate). In other words, when top management communicates with the NPD team throughout the project in an informal way and listens to them in addition to engaging in a one-way communication, they are more likely to be seen by the team as being deeply involved in the project. Practical implications: Executives must walk a managerial tightrope to actively motivate and to assist in providing resources, yet they must not be overbearing with direct guidance and must limit their tolerance for failures. Originality/value: Involvement of key organizational actors such as top management and the link to project performance has attracted significant attention in research. However, nuanced empirical insights into the dyad of top management and project teams has so far been absent. The study’s findings detail the effect of technical and social drivers of top management involvement in new product development projects. Most notably, (1) the effect of motivation and stimulating a tolerant climate on performance, and (2) the effect of organic communication on top management involvement. Moreover, this study is unique in that it empirically examines TMI from both top management and team perspectives. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","New product development project; Organic communication; Personal relevance; Personal relevance; Top management involvement",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137878411

We mobilize the theoretical framework of institutional entrepreneurship to analyze the multidimensional institutional process which involves the streams of problem recognition, policy development and politics. Our qualitative empirical study finds that the SEC Chairs attempted to couple the three streams to different extents to achieve policy breakthroughs on IFRS adoption. We show how the coupling endeavors of Chair Cox opened a temporal window of opportunity for IFRS adoption, while Chairs Schapiro and White were unsuccessful in coupling the streams due to limited recognition of IFRS adoption as a central problem for the SEC, the inability to develop a practicable policy solution and unfavorable conditions in the policy stream. Our paper offers insights into the reasons for the SEC's substantial efforts to introduce IFRS to U.S. capital markets and why these efforts never resulted in a formal decision on adopting IFRS for U.S. issuers.

We posit that a long-term ownership horizon is an enabling but not sufficient condition for sustainability and propose owner stewardship as an important contingency. Research Findings/Insights: We review 161 articles on the relationship between corporate ownership and sustainability/CSR, published during 2017–2021 and not covered by previous reviews. We find (1) in most cases, a positive effect of institutional ownership on sustainability, particularly for long-term institutional investors; (2) in most cases, a positive effect of state ownership, seen as long-term-oriented; and (3) mixed results regarding family ownership, also seen as long-term-oriented. We also observe considerable heterogeneity in how prior research defines and measures the key constructs of our review. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Long-term ownership appears to be an enabling but not sufficient condition for corporate sustainability, and stewardship at the ownership level may be an important missing link. Furthermore, the wide variety of terminology and measures in the literature poses a challenge for knowledge accumulation. Efforts towards convergence and standardization seem important. Practitioner/Policy Implications: An exclusive focus on short-termism may be misleading.

By taking a critical approach to a contemporary integrative model of leadership behavior, this theoretical research proposes an alternative approach that can supplement both the integrative model and current leader–member exchange theory. Our approach is sensitive to both objective and subjective aspects of leadership behavior. We argue that perceptions of leadership behavior are influenced by interpersonal relations and contextual variables in an organization. We further argue that multilevel aspects must be investigated to understand leadership behavior and that the perceptions thereof shape and are shaped by relations and contextual variables. A distinct methodological approach based on mixed methods is then proposed to better understand what influences perceptions of leadership behavior.

Employing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, this research aims to evaluate the economic impact of climate change on aquaculture in Vietnam, drawing on time series data from 1981 to 2013 and including aquaculture yield, acreage, investment, labor, temperature, rainfall, and damage costs to aquaculture caused by natural disasters. The results show that aquaculture yield depends not only on the current value of inputs, but also on their lag values and the yield itself. The results also show that rainfall, storm surges and tropical cyclones negatively affect aquaculture production. After any natural disaster, it takes at least two years to recover from the repercussions for productivity and return to the previous norm. To reduce the vulnerability of aquacultural communities, this study suggests that the state could establish a climate resilience fund specifically for small and medium-scale aquaculture farmers, providing special financial support for those affected by natural disasters. © 2022 Diciembre 2015 Aspe.

In the present study, medium density fibreboard (MDF), brewery spent grains (BSG) and post-extraction soybean meal (SM) were used to pyrolysis. Valorisation of these wastes via intermediate pyrolysis was carried out at a temperature of 773 K in a fixed-bed reactor under nitrogen atmosphere. The ultimate analysis showed that MDF char has offered the highest carbon content. Generally, chars obtained from these feedstocks were characterized by different internal microstructures. On the one hand, the surface of MDF char has exhibited pores with a regular pattern of small perpendicular blocks. On the other hand, irregular open spaces were detected in BSG and SM chars. The results of this investigation of the microstructure proved that the studied biomass wastes are perspective feedstocks to obtain high-value bioenergy products. Based on the enthalpy balance, it was concluded that the heating value of the pyrolysis gas was higher, the more endothermic pyrolysis process. The research hypothesis confirms that the higher the K2O/CaO ratio in the ash, the better biomass pyrolysis process was catalysed and as a result, less additional heat was required for pyrolysis. To carry out the pyrolysis of MDF, SM and BSG, additional heat input was required in the amount of 2016.8, 1467.9 and 881.1 kJ, respectively. It was found that 4–10% of the higher heating value of the raw materials was missing to achieve the self-sustaining energy of intermediate pyrolysis.

The potential of AR has been validated in lab experiments, but when implemented in real-world contexts, its commercial impact has been limited. Therefore, this paper investigates how to design AR-based services (AR services) that enhance customer experiences in retail. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a conceptual research approach to integrate research on AR in the context of retail, combining customer, retailer, and technical perspectives with the design thinking method to demonstrate how the challenge of AR service design can be addressed through design thinking. Findings: The paper develops propositions that explain how a design thinking method is useful in the design of effective AR services. The paper also articulates principles for how to implement the design thinking method in the specific context of AR for enhanced customer experiences. Practical implications: The study documents critical practices for retailers seeking to be competitive with superior customer experiences under the increasing digitalization of retailer-customer interactions.

COVID-19 has struck certain groups disproportionately; this has increased the need for availability and accessibility of health services. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 is a gender-sensitive virus relying on access to digital health means. Multiple examples and case studies are provided to illustrate the relationship between inequity, gender, and digital health.

Based on the ethnography of an orphanage in Nepal, we show that despite voluntourists’ good intentions and even (self-)criticism of the volunteer tourism approach to poverty relief, their accounts tend to consolidate rather regressive ideas about poverty. We draw on postcolonial and post-development theory to illuminate specific ways in which the old Orientalist tropes and discourses of othering are perpetuated in this novel neoliberal form of travelling. We contribute to the critical work on voluntourism and market-based approaches to societal and environmental problems by focusing on poverty as an object of consumption. Such a conception emerges from how the voluntourists’ stories were shaped by and refracted through the structure of voluntourism and the logics of social media.

Moreover, the paper aims to examine moderating effects based on experiential learning and social identity theory. Design/methodology/approach: The learning effects are evaluated through two separate quasi-experimental studies with 152 master students in business economics at a Danish university and 190 bachelor students in international business at a German university. Findings: The analysis shows that intercultural simulations with artificial cultures significantly improve participants' ability to modify their behavior depending on cultural context. Participants who identify with an artificial culture that differs radically from their own take greater advantage of the simulation. The overall duration of international experience moderates participants' learning with a U-shaped effect. Culture-specific experience strengthens the positive effect of the simulation. The comparison of the two conducted studies indicates that previous cognitive teaching enhances learning. Practical implications: The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of intercultural simulations that guide participants through all phases of the experiential learning cycle. Moreover, they underline the importance of assessing participants' cultural backgrounds before the assignment of training groups.

Existing understanding of economic coordination within inter-organizational research is based on the three modes of organization, market, and cooperative relationship. We extend the framework of Richardson that analyses specialization and complementarity within the industrial division of labour in terms of these three coordination modes. We propose a novel mode of coordinating economic activity, namely multi-actor arrangements, which is based on the coordination of very dissimilar yet complementary activities, grounded in the principle of distributed control. This fourth mode is necessary to explain contemporary phenomena such as the circular economy and blockchain because these involve interdependencies that were previously framed as too different or unrelated to coordinate. The extension is important because it changes our understanding of mixed-mode coordination. Our proposed fourth mode enables the conceptualization of how activity interdependencies are coordinated within inter-organizational relationships and networks undergoing transformation. © 2022 The Authors.

In this regard, inclusiveness scholars have focused on the role that dissimilarities play for organizational inclusion of employees but rarely on how this takes place through technology-mediated interaction. We integrate notions of identity and communication from inclusiveness and virtual work research to develop a theoretical model depicting two variants of social distance (targeted and diffuse). Subsequently we discuss how these forms of social distance affect different dimensions of inclusiveness. Our analysis suggests that the virtual work environment may weaken some negative aspects of bias and discrimination while strengthening others.

We formulate six principles of interviewing as social practice that can be used as a guide when designing and carrying out interviews as well as in their analysis.

The ambition of PDL is to facilitate a shared understanding of professional quality within the scope of organizational goals and to influence others to realize this understanding in practice. Core behaviors are attempts to create alignment between organizational goals and professional norms, to develop professional knowledge, and to activate professional knowledge and norms in practice.

The assessment is grounded in the empirical material of a three-year research project on integrated reporting (IR). Design/methodology/approach: Alvesson and Deetz’s (2021) critical management framework structures the arguments in this paper. By investigating local phenomena and the extant literature, the authors glean insights that they later critique, drawing on the empirical evidence collected during the research project. Transformative redefinitions are then proposed that point to future opportunities for research on voluntary organisational disclosures. Findings: The authors argue that the mainstream approaches to VRD, namely, incremental information and legitimacy theories, present shortcomings in addressing why and how organisations voluntarily disclose information. First, the authors find that companies adopting the International IR Council’s (IIRC, 2021) IR framework tend to comply with the framework only in an informal, rather than a substantial way. Second, the authors find that, at times, organisations serendipitously chance upon VRD practices such as IR instead of rationally recognising the potential ability of such practices to provide useful information for decision-making by investors. Also, powerful groups in organisations may use VRD practices to establish, maintain or restore power balances in their favour. Research limitations/implications: The paper’s limitations stem directly from its aim to be a critical reflection. Even when grounded on empirics, a reflection is mainly a subjective effort. Therefore, different researchers could come to different conclusions and offer different lessons from the two case studies. Practical implications: The different rationales the authors found for VRD should make a case for reporting institutions to tone down any investor-centric rhetoric in favour of more substantial disclosures. The findings imply that reporting organisations should approach the different frameworks with a critical eye and read between the lines of these frameworks to determine whether the purported normative arguments are achievable practice. Originality/value: The authors reflect on timely and relevant issues linked to recent developments in the VRD landscape. Further, the authors offer possible ways forward for critical research that may rely on different methodological choices, such as interventionist and post-structuralist research. © 2022, Giacomo Pigatto, Lino Cinquini, John Dumay and Andrea Tenucci.","Critical research; Figurational theory; Integrated reporting; Serendipity; Voluntary disclosure",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136053788

Design/methodology/approach: The authors studied how the position of police contact, a cornerstone of the recent Norwegian police reform, was interpreted and practised. The authors interviewed police contacts at two different times during reform implementation to explore how they made sense of and practised their job. Findings: The authors identified three interpretations of the position of police contact and describe them as ideal types: an administrative position, a professional position and a strategic position. The ideal types were reinforced rather than developing towards a shared understanding. Our data demonstrate that the sensemaking processes and experimentation to settle into the new position involved local actors internally in the police and externally in relation to local authorities, and reinforced local interpretations. Originality/value: This study supports the notion of sensemaking as distributed but extends previous research by suggesting that “ideal types” help us understand the content of interpretations. This study also extends the understanding by showing that distributed sensemaking takes place as individuals make sense of more open-ended problems. This challenges the understanding of the term distributed, because unless challenged, distributed sensemaking in isolated pockets of the organization remain local, and the authors suggest that the term local distributed sensemaking captures this phenomenon. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Distributed sensemaking; Exploration and exploitation; Ideal types; Local distributed sensemaking; Police; Reform implementation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85136008878

The process to develop and evaluate these plans needs to encompass not only technical and economic specifics but each plan's impacts on the environment and local inhabitants must also be considered. This inclusive planning involves multiple criteria and requires a means of handling them. In this paper a series of potential future energy systems are generated with the EnergyPlan software for the Faroe Islands before these systems are assessed using a set of criteria covering their environmental, social, technical and economic aspects. These criteria are used by two multi-criteria approaches, along with actual weights obtained from local stakeholders, to rank the energy systems.

We employ a “communication as constitutive of brands” (CCB) approach that conceptualizes brand as a discursive brand space, and we draw attention to the way in which brand meaning is co-created by relevant stakeholders, specifically by employees. This challenges the classical paradigm of brand management that assumes a high degree of managerial control over the brand. Drawing on data obtained during a longitudinal case study involving the strategic use of employees’ stories, we analyse the communicative labour involved when employees’ voluntary activities outside of work are used to communicate a CSR philosophy in the constitution of a corporate brand. We focus on the narratives of managers and employees, with the aim of understanding how employees are invited to co-author the discursive brand space, while at the same time, brand management attempts to manage the development of the branding process by functioning as a practical author. Through the concept of “practical author” we show how management attempts to author a coherent and shared brand narrative by highlighting some preferred discourses over others. As we discuss, this invites considerations of how authority and nuances of power may be addressed within a communicative approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Co-creation; Communication as constitutive of brands; Communicative labour; CSR; Employee narratives; Practical author, employee embodiment",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135856141

Contrary to widely held beliefs, historically, there is no logical or practical connection between ‘more deserving’ and ‘state support’. Theoretically, the article integrates elite scholarship and cultural sociology in developing a concept of moral elites’ power from—their sources of moral authority—and power to, the way that they have used their power to classify citizens and sectors. Empirically, the Danish moral elite and its involvement in social policy are analyzed based on secondary as well as primary historical sources. Findings: The development of the Danish moral elite has roots in the administrators of the nineteenth-century absolutist state: the clergy, medical doctors, and lawyers. Educational resources and state affiliation continue to be central to moral elite status. Economists have ascended to the top of the moral elite, while clergymen have dropped out. Three major classifications were developed during the period. ‘Help to self-help’ (late nineteenth century): deserving poor should receive help from private charity, while the public system should deter and discipline. ‘Rights’ (mid-twentieth century): the state should care for all, philanthropy mostly considered stigmatizing. ‘Workfare’ (late twentieth century to present): citizens are considered deserving as long as they are ‘active’, and sectors are considered equal in providing for citizens as long as they reach the economistic goal of activation. © 2022, The Author(s).","Deservingness; Moral elites; Philanthropy; Voluntarism; Welfare state",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135832710

It does so by examining the roles of Norwegians’ beliefs about climate change and emissions from air travel, their felt responsibility to limit emissions (personal norm), and expectations and behaviors of friends and family (social norms) in such travel. A representative sample of Norwegians was surveyed in 2019 and 2020 (N = 2842), based on a framework combining institutional and social-psychological perspectives. Structural equation modeling of the data reveals that leisure air travel is habituated and part of a lifestyle, supported by social norms, self-enhancement values and urban residency. Personal norms for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from flying are beginning to emerge in Norway, but their effect on leisure air travel is small and only indirect. Our findings suggest the need for interventions to complement and potentially amplify the emerging moralization process and support an evolution of new habits and travel lifestyle to limit the emissions from leisure air travel substantially.

For the first question, we identify an important but overlooked economic mechanism driving probabilistic selling in vertically differentiated markets: the convexity of consumer preferences. In stark contrast to the literature finding that probabilistic selling is never profitable except in the presence of certain capacity constraint or consumer bounded rationality, we find that with many alternative utility functions capable of representing convex preference, probabilistic selling is always profitable. For the second question, we study the optimal strategy of probabilistic selling, including the design and price of the probabilistic good and the prices of the component goods. We show that under some technical conditions, the optimal price of the high-quality component good increases while the optimal price of the low-quality component good decreases upon the introduction of probabilistic selling, thereby increasing the market coverage and the economic efficiency without launching an actual new product line. To further illustrate the design of probabilistic selling, we use an example based on the canonical utility function, which is widely used in the economics literature on vertical product differentiation. We derive a closed-form solution to the problem of optimal probabilistic selling. We also take advantage of the analytical tractability of the canonical utility to further explore the design of multiple probabilistic goods. © 2022 The Authors.

I argue for a distinction between cases where work itself is meaningful and cases where other sources of meaning are found at work. The term ‘meaningful work’ is most useful for the former cases. I then argue for the reasons account of what makes work itself meaningful: work is meaningful if (and to the extent that) there are good reasons to do it. I compare this to established accounts of meaningful work, such as subjective meaningfulness, self-realization, alienation, the unity of conception and execution, autonomy, social contribution, and Veltman’s four-dimensional account. None of these capture the distinct concern that the concept ‘meaningful work’ should capture, or they do so less well than the reasons account. This also shows that work can be meaningful regardless of whether it is good in other respects, such as in inherent interest or opportunities for self-realization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Meaning in life; Meaningful work; Reasons account; Revisionary conceptual analysis",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135389303

Whereas the SDGs’ predecessors, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), were specifically formulated for governmental adoption, the SDGs stand apart in inviting diverse stakeholders, including private industry, to participate in sustainable development. Literature is emerging about how private industry can engage in the SDG framework. We aim to contribute to the sustainability and cross-sector partnership literatures by examining the motivations of organizations that partner into SDG platforms. This research started as an exploratory study to understand how corporations use the SDGs strategically, and we identified platforms as a means of strategic corporate engagement with the SDGs. Our findings are based on semi-structured interviews and documents, and they focus on four Danish SDG platforms: UNLEASH, Hello Science, Fra Filantropi til Forretning (From Philanthropy to Business), and the SDG Accelerator. The findings suggest that speed, impact, and scaling of SDG innovations are features of SDG platforms that motivate cross-sector, boundary-spanning collaboration. We suggest that the larger ambition of the platforms is to shift the value framing from profit outputs to SDG impacts and outcomes, ultimately imagined as a business landscape based on SDG innovation; and we propose a model to reflect the SDG platform process structure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Innovation platforms; Multi-stakeholder partnerships; Qualitative research; Sustainable Development Goals; Systemic change",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135310383

On the one hand, MPW is deployed to increase employee worktime utilization and productivity, which should be reflected in more timely project completion. On the other hand, MPW also brings switching costs due to attention residue and cognitive setup. Based on this trade-off, we derive an inverted U-shaped relationship between MPW and project performance. We find support for this relationship in a longitudinal dataset containing 9,649 project-month-employee observations. More specialized experience, project similarity, and employee familiarity positively moderate the inverted U-shape. Furthermore, the results are robust to a host of model specifications, data structures, assumptions, and alternative explanations. Managerial Summary: How many projects can you work on simultaneously? We study this question in the context of new product development (NPD) projects in a multinational organization. We suggest that multi-project work (MPW) might be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, MPW academics or engineers can be more productive by filling the gaps in their schedules and developing time management practices. On the other hand, MPW also carries switching costs. This trade-off creates an inverted U-shaped relationship between MPW and project performance. So, how can MPW be more beneficial or less costly?

Consequently, more decentralized, responsive, and fluid organizational designs are now at the core of IB research. Juxtaposing recent arguments questioning subsidiary research altogether, we argue that IB scholars can explore and explain complex realities in the contemporary MNE without unnecessarily restricting the breadth of the field and giving up links to established research and theory.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to test whether MNCs’ subsidiaries in China increase FDI into BRI-affiliated countries after the BRI’s launch. This study compares FDIs by Chinese subsidiaries of foreign MNCs in the year before and two years after the BRI’s announcement. Hypotheses are tested for two explanations of why foreign MNCs seek to exploit the BRI. Findings: Investments into BRI-affiliated countries increased after the announcement of the BRI, and this increase is positively moderated by institutional distance between the MNC home country and the BRI-affiliated target country. This shows that the greater the institutional costs of investing in a BRI-affiliated country, the more responsive the MNCs’ Chinese subsidiary will be to the BRI. Research limitations/implications: This study demonstrates that MNCs respond to transnational political frameworks. This study only studies the immediate response because the BRI is an infrastructure project. Better infrastructure will, over time, lead to more investments; however, the immediate response is due not to infrastructure but political structure. Originality/value: The results show how MNCs use transnational political frameworks. The idea that MNCs can channel FDI through existing subsidiaries for this purpose has not previously been discussed in the literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Belt and road initiative (BRI); Foreign direct investment (FDI); Institutional cost; Legitimacy; Multinational corporations (MNCs)",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135252306

Despite the underlying commonality of these forms—organizing an economic activity through multiple governance modes—each form has spawned its own stream of theoretical and empirical research, with relatively little cross-stream knowledge exchange. In this paper, we argue that, given the fragmented nature of these literatures, unexplored opportunities exist for scholars to pursue new research opportunities by importing theoretical predictions, causal mechanisms, and methods from the other streams in theoretically appropriate ways. To highlight what is possible, we first take stock of the distinctive characteristics, conceptual foundations, and dominant methodologies associated with the three literatures. We then identify four key governance challenges—monitoring, cooperation, learning, and competition—that were common across the streams and use these challenges to isolate theoretical and methodological blind spots that merit further research consideration. Our research agenda addresses these blind spots, proposes specific avenues for theory development within each stream of plural governance research, and helps scholars of the franchising, dual distribution, and concurrent sourcing literatures to connect and contribute to research in the intellectual core of plural governance. © The Author(s) 2022.","buyer-supplier; concurrent sourcing; cooperative strategy; dual distribution; franchising; interorganizational relationships; plural governance; vertical integration",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135203740

We address this shortcoming by exploring the initial communicative enactment of COVID-19 in the media-based public discourse in Switzerland, Germany, and the United Kingdom. By applying a social problem work lens, we identify three mechanisms that explain the maturation of COVID-19 into a grand challenge, further showing how these are contextually dependent on differences in discourse quality.

Building upon an interpretive analytical framework we offer a way forward to examine relationships between societal institutions and distributed collective work in change processes. Our longitudinal qualitative study based upon interviews and observations examines how the concept of value-based healthcare was translated at a hospital. The translators developed three micro-tactics: disregard, maintenance and displacement, grounded in their narration of practice changes. Translators enacted institutional logics differently at the levels of meaning and practice when they framed, rationalized and contextualized the potentialities of a new concept, and this complexity provided the possibility of various practice outcomes. We contribute to the understanding of translation by demonstrating how a heterogeneous institutional context encourages translators to change selected practices but also to decouple and maintain most of the existing practices due to their enactment of institutionalized rationalities. Moreover, we discuss how translation outcomes are impacted by collaborating actors’ shared interpretations of their institutional context. Collaborating translators need to agree on whether and what practice change is valuable for the organization, and change is only possible when they interpret that they have the leverage to align a new idea with dominant institutional logics. © The Author(s) 2022.","collaborative translation work; decoupling; editing; institutional logics; interpretive analytical framework; micro-tactics; translation; value-based healthcare",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135155545

Specifically, we explored how CrossFitters in Denmark made sense of and experienced the changes of their leisure practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with 20 CrossFitters recruited from different CrossFit boxes showed that not only activity levels but also emotional energy and group solidarity dropped considerably during COVID-19 as members lacked interactions within the CrossFit boxes which had been crucial for their participation before the pandemic. Notably, new training situations, specifically online workouts, could not replace the highly successful interaction rituals in the CrossFit box, which stresses the significance of face-to-face interactions for continuous leisure-time physical activity. In so doing, this article contributes to discussions about whether online workouts and digitally mediated communities can complement or replace physical training. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","community; emotions; fitness; interaction rituals; micro-sociology; Sport",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135141004

This is surprising, since individuals are bounded rational and prone to systematic biases in high-risk business processes, including entrepreneurship. This article suggests that entrepreneurship programmes should include curricula that furnish awareness of the cognitive mechanisms involved in biased decision making with financial risk. In support of our proposition, this article builds on data from a laboratory-based money games experiment in which students who enrol in entrepreneurship programmes are compared with students who do not in their risk behaviour. We show when, why and how students suffer from specific biases – namely, the prior gain effect and the degree-of-risk effect – that are relevant in environments characterised by high financial risk, and specifically in entrepreneurship. These insights challenge the adequacy of entrepreneurship programme curricula in addressing bounded-rational decision making, as topics such as risk and biased decision making are often overlooked.

The study data set included more than 80 website observation items, data about downloadable annual sustainability reports, financial performance data and the environmental scores in the CDP Rating and the Refinitiv ESG Scores. Descriptive statistical analyses and correlation analyses were performed for the entire sample and for the regional subsets of the sample. One of the major results is that all regions show low levels of website disclosure. However, some variation in the extent of disclosure was found. The lowest level of disclosure was found for Chinese websites. Higher levels were observed for the companies from Europe, Japan and the United States. The analysis of the reports revealed that only one-third of the sample companies from China but more than half of the companies from Europe, Japan and the United States supply recent reports. It was also found that integrated reports are less used in the United States, particularly when compared with companies from Europe and Japan. Insights also suggest that there is a weak to moderate correlation between one of the disclosure scores used and the Refinitiv ESG Scores.

However, not only do these approaches fail to address street art’s ephemeral and intangible aspects, they are also exclusive. In response, drawing on more-than-representational theory and critical theories of heritage and street art, this paper proposes ‘evental heritage’ as a new frame for conceptualising the affective heritage politics of street art, as well as the ‘heritagisation’ of street art as a dynamic force for material and socio-political change. Exploring three events from Norway, the research argues that the unexpected destruction, removal or ‘threat of removal’ of street artworks is not necessarily negative, as it may enact a democratic heritage politics of street art through which the dominant pole of authorised aesthetics may be challenged and shaped. In particular, the exploration shows that such events can not only lead to a reconsideration of the meaning and value of street art, but also reveals the failures of representation and gives rise to new collective ways of being, doing and thinking about the city commons. ©, Laima Nomeikaite.","evental heritage; more-than-representational theory; Politics of Affect; Street art",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134731329

The menu represents the increased invasion of lifeworlds by the commercialization and corporate regulation of the tourism social Web. The stranger symbolizes the weak accountability of online communities. The tourist-light embodies the relevance of hedonism in virtual worlds.

Both the supply and the demand sides of economies were severely affected, followed by a dramatic dip in global GDP. As a response, policymakers introduced an unprecedented number of interventions to back up employees, firms, and industries to counteract the collapsing markets. Our main objective is to explore how these fundamental policy interventions are likely to influence the future potential and functioning of markets. Historically swings in the pendulum favoring either market-based solutions or more regulated public sectors have coincided with disruptive crises. The overall question is what will happen during post-COVID-19, will governments withdraw their crisis policies and how will a possible retreat be organized? Are we entering an era of permanently increased governmental interventions? More precisely, we identify three specific threats to the market-oriented economy: the extension and development of governmental expenditures, protectionistic measures, and the level of state aid and the degree of competition at markets. We are particularly interested in the effect of the COVID-19 measures, and their possible extension, on Schumpeterian dynamics, both in terms of entry and exits (Schumpeter I) and how the position of large firms will be affected (Schumpeter II). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Competition; Fiscal framework; Market economy; Public sector; Size of government; Size of market; State aid; State intervention",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134689155

We find that our new aligned investor sentiment index has greater predictive power for housing returns than the principal component analysis (PCA)-based sentiment index, used earlier in the literature. Moreover, shrinkage models utilizing the disaggregate sentiment proxies do not result in forecast improvement indicating that aligned sentiment index optimally exploits information in the disaggregate proxies of investor sentiment. Furthermore, when we let the machine learning models to choose from all key control variables and the aligned sentiment index, the forecasting accuracy is improved at all forecasting horizons, rather than just the short-run as witnessed under standard predictive regressions. This result suggests that machine learning methods are flexible enough to capture both structural change and time-varying information in a set of predictors simultaneously to forecast housing returns of China in a precise manner. Given the role of the real estate market in China's economic growth, our result of accurate forecasting of housing returns has important implications for both investors and policymakers. © 2022 The Authors.

The data cover 6 years of campaign and media materials from a case company with several CEO-initiated activist campaigns. Our findings from an inductive analysis contribute to CEO activism theorizing in three ways. First, we extend CEO activism conceptually by identifying five underlying activities that support a public stance: anchoring motivations, modeling action, taking agency, enduring criticism, and normalizing activism. Second, we bridge individual- and organization-level analyses by depicting how a CEO involves a company in activism through activities that justify interrelated topic frame and role frame. Third, we develop a processual model that includes the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases and explains how the underlying activities are interrelated and follow a pattern that serves to maintain CEO activism. Accordingly, CEO activism includes activities, through the pre-stance, stance-taking, and post-stance phases, whereby a CEO deliberately engages personally and through a company in public debate about sensitive socio-political issues and the role of businesses in addressing them. © The Author(s) 2022.","CEO activism; corporate activism; frames; processual model",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134321210

The nature and functioning of such a process is largely unknown. The authors suggest that travelers, often subconsciously, mentally simulate future hotel stays and predict future feelings to inform their decision-making, a process referred to as affective forecasting. Executing an experimental design, the authors show that actively engaging in episodic future thinking to trigger affective forecasting increases travelers’ intentions toward holiday accommodations. This effect is mediated by hotel trust and risk perception, demonstrating that affective forecasting is an effective way for regaining tourists’ trust and reducing their perceived risk during a pandemic.

Existing research sheds little light on the determinants of IT carve-out project complexity and/or its effects on divestor performance. Instead, research has focused on the post-acquisition IT integration project and acquirer performance. This paper presents the first divestor-centric model of IT transactions from the divestor to the acquirer when a Business Unit in a Multi-Business Organization (MBO) is carved out and integrated into another MBO. The model explains how divestor business and IT alignment pre-conditions contribute to increased IT carve-out project complexity. Such complexity increases IT carve-out project time to physical IT separation and creates IT stranded assets, which decrease post-divestment business, IT alignment and divestor performance. The current recommended strategy of adopting transitional service agreements (TSAs) to handle IT carve-out complexity is compared with two new proactive strategies derived from the model.

The inter-institutional interactions among the DGs formally increased, especially with respect to information clarification and the allocation of competences and resources. However, the top-down reforms undermined the DGs' and the services' entrepreneurial role in policy governance and innovation. In response, the individual DGs demonstrated resistance and resilience to these reforms.

Design/methodology/approach: The conceptual model was tested with data collected from 190 randomly selected hotel units located in Greece, using both online and drop-in questionnaire methods. Data were analyzed using SEM analysis. Findings: Satisfaction with the working relationship was found to be enhanced by improving communication and cooperation, as well as by keeping conflict and opportunism at low levels. This was a strong predictor of inter-partner creativity, although less pronounced under high levels of relational distance and rigidity. Research limitations/implications: The study should be extended to other country settings, replicated at different levels of crisis severity, and use dyadic data. Additional environmental factors could be used as boundary conditions, while our model could be expanded to include additional drivers and consequences of inter-partner creativity. Practical implications: To generate inter-partner creativity, there is a need to maintain high levels of satisfaction through proper communication, enhanced cooperation, conflict minimization, and avoidance of opportunistic actions. Also, to better translate satisfaction into inter-partner creativity, interacting parties should keep distance at low levels, while at the same time demonstrate greater flexibility. Originality/value: The study unveils the role of effectively managing behavioral factors in inter-firm relationships to develop creative solutions to the Covid-19 crisis challenges, an issue neglected by prior research. The study also sheds light on the contingent effects of distance and rigidity, two important factors moderating relationships under crisis.

In contrast, this paper aims to explore the possibility of conditions through which things and spaces are enacted to be non-auditable. Design/methodology/approach: Using the concept of proliferation and rarefaction (Callon and Law, 2005), the paper adopts a case-comparison design to explore two empirical sites. The first investigates a vast excess of audit structures against the case of the biggest corporate fraud in German accounting history, the Wirecard scandal. The second discusses the configuration of Tinder, the most popular provider of mobile dating and the absence of visible verification mechanisms. Findings: The paper argues that things can become non-auditable through two mechanisms. Based on the two empirical sites, non-auditability can happen through an overload of auditable resources or, through the withdrawal of required resources. The paper discusses the consequences of this finding and suggests avenues for future research on non-auditability. Originality/value: While accounting scholars have extensively addressed the audit explosion and traced how audit practices have journeyed into ever more novel terrains, this paper discusses forms of escape from the value-subverting and reductive accounts incorporated in the audit society. It thereby points to conditions under which accounting ends. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Audit society; Auditability; Non-auditable; Tinder; Wirecard",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133947843

Some retailers have responded by abolishing price promotions. However, is it the macro-level of the market structure, or the micro-level of the consumer, that is to blame for food waste? With an outset in consumer responsibilization theory and through 24 in-depth qualitative interviews, we explore how consumers and institutional actors perceive the responsibility for food waste in the interface between retailers and consumers, and how this perception has evolved. We identify two responsibility narratives—one that portrays the consumer as a self-governed actor and the other as interdependent on the institutionally shaped context. We uniquely show that over time, a process of hybrid responsibility expansion has led to an extension of the consumer's responsibility into the retailer's domain of action, and vice versa. Findings highlight that responsibilization is not either on the consumers or retailers' side and can expand for both. This provides a nuance and a new contribution to the theory. For businesses, our results imply that abolishing price promotions does not align with consumer's ascription of responsibility. In turn, actions that involve collaborations of actors, including consumers, speak much more to the perception of responsibility expansion. © 2022 The Authors.

The study database was collected and calculated from 61 provinces in the period of 2006-2018. The economic equation is estimated with 3 types of data including the full sample, the North and the South regions, and six sub-economic regions. The empirical results present several important scientific contributions. First, the estimated results show the Kuznets curve hypothesis is confirmed in Vietnam when the relationship between income growth and inequality is presented by an inverted U-shaped curve. Second, the Kuznets curve does not occur in the provinces which have a high level of economic liberalization and a large private sector, as evidenced by the analysis of sub-samples. Economic integration is a progressive process provided foreign direct investment decreases inequality in most regions. Educational development helps to reduce inequality but this relationship is only found in the areas populated by ethnic minorities. The labour force has a positive and significant relationship to inequality, especially in regions with labour shortages, although this variable can even help reduce inequality in some sub-economic regions that have an abundance of labour. Tourism development and trade variables are considered to be the sources of inequality in lower development regions. The empirical results suggest that policymakers need to continuously reduce income inequality to support sustainable development in the future. © 2022, Centre of Sociological Research.

However, the method has long lacked a statistical test to compare different models in terms of their predictive accuracy and to establish whether a proposed model offers a significantly better out-of-sample predictive accuracy than a naïve benchmark. This paper aims to address this methodological research gap in predictive model assessment and selection in composite-based modeling. Design/methodology/approach: Recent research has proposed the cross-validated predictive ability test (CVPAT) to compare theoretically established models. This paper proposes several extensions that broaden the scope of CVPAT and explains the key choices researchers must make when using them. A popular marketing model is used to illustrate the CVPAT extensions’ use and to make recommendations for the interpretation and benchmarking of the results. Findings: This research asserts that prediction-oriented model assessments and comparisons are essential for theory development and validation. It recommends that researchers routinely consider the application of CVPAT and its extensions when analyzing their theoretical models. Research limitations/implications: The findings offer several avenues for future research to extend and strengthen prediction-oriented model assessment and comparison in PLS-SEM. Practical implications: Guidelines are provided for applying CVPAT extensions and reporting the results to help researchers substantiate their models’ predictive capabilities.

Despite a general recognition among economists and management scholars that government efforts to guide and control innovation or subsidize private entrepreneurs have failed to yield results, these calls also describe an entrepreneurial state in which bureaucrats, not entrepreneurs, direct not only basic research but also applied technological development. Building on the notions of economic competence and ownership competence we argue that even well-intentioned and strongly motivated public actors lack the ability to manage the process of innovation, especially under Knightian uncertainty. As stewards of resources owned by the public, government bureaucrats do not exercise the ultimate responsibility that comes with ownership. Moreover, government ownership of firms and labs and government intervention in the management of privately owned assets hampers the competitive process of putting ownership of innovative firms and projects in the hands of individuals and groups with higher levels of ownership ability. We suggest that ownership competence differs systematically between public and private actors, particularly around innovation, with important implications for innovation policy. © 2022, The Author(s).","Competence; Innovation; Knightian uncertainty; Market for corporate control: Public choice; Ownership",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133756940

Such projects are the products of a business operation that governs the exercise of the real call option on development that is represented by developable land. We present a framework for considering super-normal profit in the RED industry, and then in light of that framework we examine RED projects produced by publicly-traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). We find strong evidence of positive correlation between REITs’ Tobin-Q ratios, indicative of positive NPV, and the ratio of development assets to total assets in the firm, controlling for other factors.

Design/methodology/approach: In this reflection on the paper “Accounting for tacit coordination: The passing of accounts and the broader case for accounting theory” (Vollmer, 2019), the author argues that the silences of the qualitative empirical management accounting research process may preclude research from understanding the silences of accounting practitioners and shape the trajectory of the discipline as a whole. Findings: The author presents a slightly exaggerated depiction of the qualitative empirical management accounting research process. From this, the author infers what impedes empirically studying unorthodox phenomena such as the silences of accounting practitioners. Originality/value: The author offers a critical perspective on the author’s own research process, using accounting silences as way of reflecting on the potential and limitations of empirical research. Finally, the author makes tentative suggestions for opening up the standard research process. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Methodology; Qualitative research methods; Silence; Tacit coordination",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133434897

The results provide a classification of the challenges that ETO companies have to manage in each phase of the implementation of product configurators, and a framework that supports managers in defining the actions necessary for the development and implementation of product configurators.

The detailed literature review on the status of excess heat recovery identified a very diverse nature of district heating regulations in the different countries along with different layouts of contracts and business models. An analysis of the potential for excess heat utilisation in Denmark shows a substantial increase in excess heat utilisation in district heating. The identified barriers include access to a market (district heating network), lack of a comprehensive regulatory framework along with standardising contracts, lacking sinks (end users), and absent financial incentives to make excess heat a viable option for the potentially involved stakeholders. © 2022 IEEE.","decarbonization; district heating; EMB3Rs; excess heat; waste heat","District heating; Economic and social effects; Laws and legislation; Waste heat utilization; Business models; Decarbonisation; Denmark; EMB3R; European Countries; European union; Excess heats; Heat utilization; Literature reviews; Regulation models; Waste heat",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133420701

We do this by comparing the networks and entry wages for two groups of new hires: those who exit self-employment to become wage-employed and those who change employers as wage employees, i.e., job changers. Referrals are defined as coworker ties through which the new hire and an incumbent worker share a common employment history before their current employment. We use longitudinal Swedish register-based data to evaluate the entry wages of the two groups of new hires for the years between 2010 and 2013. The results show that having coworker ties is associated with 2.9% higher entry wages and that this network premium is uniform across the formerly self-employed and job changers. However, the new hires from self-employment have consistently lower entry wages than the job changers, even if the exiting self-employed have coworker ties. © 2022, The Author(s).","Entry wages; Exit; Labor mobility; Network; Referrals; Self-employment",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133413017

Utilizing a linear dynamic panel model based on Bayes predictor, we show that supplementing forecasting models with interest rate uncertainty improves the forecasting performance with the augmented model yielding lower forecast errors in comparison to a baseline model which includes unemployment rate, federal funds rate, and spread variables. Further separating PPNRs into two components that reflect net interest and non-interest income, we show that the predictive power of interest rate uncertainty is concentrated on the non-interest component of bank revenues. Finally, examining the point predictions under a severely stressed scenario, we show that the model can successfully predict the negative effect on overall bank revenues with a rise in the non-interest component of income during 2009:Q1. Overall, the findings suggest that stress testing exercises that involve bank revenue models can benefit from the inclusion of interest rate uncertainty and the cross-sectional information embedded in the panel of BHCs. © 2022 The Authors.

While these moments can induce significant stress and are prone to avoidance and procrastination (Bagozzi and Verbeke 2020; DeCarlo and Lam 2016; Ingram et al. 2017), they are crucial for a salesperson’s success (DeCarlo and Lam 2016; Sabnis et al. 2013). Some salespeople react with procrastination while others dive headfirst into these challenges (e.g., Bolander et al. 2020; DeCarlo and Lam 2016). This study explores whether these different reactions relate to genetic predispositions. Drawing on differential susceptibility theory (DST) (e.g., Belsky and Pluess 2009; Homberg and Jagiellowicz 2021) and stress research (e.g., Nelson and Cooper 2007), our study proposes that carrying the Serotonin Transporter Gene S allele (SERT S) together with the psychological traits of sensation seeking and neuroticism interactively affects a salesperson’s propensity to canvass and close. Based on a rich sample of genetic information and survey data from 597 salespeople, the empirical results show that carrying SERT S has a positive relationship with canvassing and closing if sensation seeking is high. In contrast, this relationship is negative if neuroticism is high. The findings of the study contribute to sales research, DST, and organizational stress research, and provide actionable implications for business practice. First, we contribute to the sparse literature explaining the genetic roots of variation in salesperson behavior (e.g., Verbeke et al. 2017) by showing how genetic variations interact with psychological traits to influence sales behavior. Second, we introduce a DST perspective to marketing and sales research, showing that the same genetic variation can have diametrical effects on performance-related behavior. Third, we add to DST and organizational stress research by providing a new angle on the occurrence of eustress and distress at the workplace. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Differential susceptibility theory; Distress; Eustress; Genes; Neuroticism; Sales; Sensation seeking; Serotonin transporter gene (SERT)",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133361332

Based on interviews with performing artists in music and theatre, we show how creative workers feel compelled to perform negative (tortured and despondent) identity work in order to attain a positive (coherent, self-sustaining and self-affirming) sense of artistic self. We argue that the dubious link between mental illness and creativity, propagated not only by popular media and pseudo-scientific accounts but also by art history and the creative industries themselves, has served to undergird a social imaginary of the artist as a ‘tortured’ creator. This imaginary in turn provides discursive resources, behavioral cues and affective stimulation for the performance of occupationally desirable yet perilous tormented creative selves. We identify three distinct identity work strategies undertaken by creative workers, namely self-analysis, self-diagnosis and self-medication, in which social imaginaries purporting an overlap between mental illness and creativity in artistic work play a constitutive role. Our findings contribute to the emergent interdisciplinary literature on identity work in the creative industries and the arts. Moreover, we caution that the negative forms of identity-building practised by our interviewees, underpinned as they are by social imaginaries of the artist as anguished, dejected and agonized, may in fact be dangerously counterproductive for creative workers coping with the higher rates of depression, anxiety and substance abuse found in precarious creative professions. © The Author(s) 2022.","anxiety; creative industries; creative work; depression; identity work; mad genius; mental illness; precarity; social imaginaries; tortured artist",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133343506

Based on in-depth qualitative case studies of eight (8) gig economy entrepreneurs originally from Eastern European countries Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, and Slovakia, we found that being (dis)advantaged immigrant entrepreneurs is not that black and white phenomenon. We further found that most entrepreneurial ventures were started due to the inability of the immigrant to find a job in the area of his study or interest, mostly due to barriers to entry into the labor market. Significant differences in the dynamics of being disadvantaged based on sector of gig economy operations, where in highly skilled sectors, this phenomenon was less visible. We also found that ease of doing business in Denmark and available help for entrepreneurship played a key role in the start and later growth of gig economy entrepreneurial ventures of these immigrant entrepreneurs. Finally, the case respondents highlighted that despite certain prejudices that may lead to a disadvantaged position, language skills, as well as a supportive institutional framework, play an important role in diluting those influences. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","and Survival; Disadvantaged; Gig Economy; Immigrant Entrepreneurs; Nordic",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133210650

Social and political debates discuss the length of their stay, possible return and integration policies, approaching migrants often as objects, not as individuals with agency and entrepreneurial endeavours regarding settlement. However, many migrants develop entrepreneurial strategies related to a particular place and accessible resources. These coping-location strategies without ethnic enclave pull have received little attention. In many smaller cities and villages, the role of such newcomers can be fundamental for the local economy counterbalancing migration to urban areas. This study presents location choice and particular location-relationships of disadvantaged migrants in a small town of Klagenfurt, Austria. Contrary to some expectations, their relationship to the new “home” is emotional, strong and permanent, and central to their entrepreneurship. We suggest that this type of disadvantaged migrant entrepreneurship with new local roots is a specific non-mobile category different from the ethnic enclave settlement. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Disadvantaged migrants; Entrepreneurial coping strategy; Immigrant entrepreneurship; Location choice; Refugee entrepreneurship",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133198430

This raises the question of whether such losses were a push into traumatic resignation or a push to start a business? And what are the main factors that influence responses? This chapter aims to answer these questions by drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour in order to help advance the scarce literature on entrepreneurial intentions under adverse conditions. We build and test a model of entrepreneurial intention highlighting entrepreneurial mindset (self-efficacy and opportunity perception) and social capital as core determinants of entrepreneurial intention. Using a sample of 1777 owner-managers and employees in Egypt surveyed by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), results of logistic regression reveal that former owner-managers, who had just lost their business, were less entrepreneurially minded and networked less than their continuing counterparts. Former employees, who had just lost their job, were no more entrepreneurially minded than their continuing counterparts. Results also show that self-efficacy and opportunity perception play a key role in promoting people’s entrepreneurial intention. The findings contribute to the debate on predictors of entrepreneurial intention in hostile environments and developing countries; and pave the way for studies on whether disadvantages such as the COVID-19 pandemic prompt a new type of entrepreneurship where necessity aligns with opportunity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Business loss; COVID-19; Disadvantaged workers; Egypt; Entrepreneurial intention; Entrepreneurial mindset; Job loss; Social capital",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133168234

We describe two challenges that affect the validity of our method, and how to handle them. By applying our method to a one-week trace of network traffic, we illustrate that unnamed traffic is ubiquitous in a university network across nearly all client systems, destination IP addresses, and destination services.

This paper aims to focus on what areas small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) consider when implementing new target segments in the organization. If firms do not understand the potential complexity and plan for implementation, they risk overlooking important areas that cause organizational resistance and failure in the market. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on a literature study and five SME case studies based on 44 interviews and 10 intervention workshops. Findings: The authors identify key areas of change that SMEs consider when planning to implement segments in the organization, including marketing strategy and plans, organizational aspects and implementation processes. Organization changes and sales plays are key considerations among SME managers. The authors further identify four categories characterized by different degrees of marketing and organizational changes that SMEs face when implementing new target segments, reflecting SMEs former choices. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on interviews and workshops that bring managers into a situation where they can evaluate needed changes to implement segments. The managers can express the complexity and the effect of the implementation. Practical implications: This paper presents considerations and insights derived from SMEs and discusses how firms can be better equipped to implement new segments.

The way that the educator sees his or her role relative to the students is of critical importance because this directly influences pedagogy choices, expectations for students and learning outcomes, as well as job satisfaction. While recent studies propose typologies characterizing pedagogical approaches of educators, few of these are based on the data from entrepreneurship educators. Framed within role identity theory, we conducted 13 in–depth interviews to examine how entrepreneurship educators perceive their role. Using the qualitative data analysis tool (NVivo), we analyzed how the relationship between their perceptions of their role and core value orientation is connected to teaching approaches. Results show that these educators view their roles as teacher-focused, network-focused, or student-focused and that these perspectives are associated with different perceptions of students’ role and learning objectives. Further, we find different levels of emphasis on roles and that personal core values are differentially linked to these roles.

Despite a wealth of research and decades of implementing countless diversity and work-life balance (WLB) initiatives, only a small fraction of women ‘make partner’ in such PSFs. We argue that the problems around women's career progression are reproduced and exacerbated by the very “caring” initiatives that claim to support these women. In order to investigate the implications of such WLB initiatives for women providing accounting services, this article draws on extensive empirical material gathered in the span of 12 years within two leading accounting, auditing, and consulting firms. From this material, we present the stories of four women accountants who are on the receiving end of these WLB initiatives – as well as their repressive effects. We find that WLB measures exert epistemic control, gaslighting women accountants by manipulating their sense of reality and persuading them to work less than their male counterparts. This repressive care feminizes these women, constructing them as fragile and thus in need to forgo work opportunities. However, once it is time for evaluations, their superiors forfeit their promotions. In so doing, WLB measures further gender the understanding of what ‘counts’ as accounting and consulting work and ultimately direct women's careers sideways – into stagnation – rather than upwards, to partner levels. © 2022","Gaslighting; Professional service firms; Women accountants; Work-life balance",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132927397

The majority of publication is searching for law-like relations or development of descriptive frameworks. More prescriptive knowledge is needed to guide the project managers in navigating the project complexity in project managers' pursuit of success. Identifying the complexities of a given project is a real-world problem for project managers (Mikkelsen et al., 2021). The purpose of the paper is to investigate the research of prescriptive knowledge on the management of project complexity. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a longitudinally case study, this paper uses Action Design Research (Sein et al., 2011) (ADR) to research the management of project stakeholder complexity. ADR is a variation of action research (AR) with inspiration from design science (Hevner et al., 2004) where an artifact is designed to solve a real-world problem. In this case study, an information system was configured in collaboration with the project managers of the recipient organization. Findings: The findings from the research project are presented using the affordance theory (Gibson, 1977) as a framing concept and give special attention the affordance perception (Pozzi et al., 2014). Among the project managers, who were very engaged in the co-design, the majority refrained from activating the information system and got the outside view from the stakeholders. Interviews afterward identified “fear of bad project ratings from the stakeholder” as the main course of resistance to deploy the surveying information system. Originality/value: The paper contributes on two levels. The paper presents a novel approach to researching project complexity based on engaging the stakeholder in generating a common perception of the ongoing state of the projects. The paper also contributes insights into reasons for reluctance on the part of the participants (the project managers) of the recipient organization and hereby adds to the understanding of the organizational change aspect of AR in the research of project management. The paper concludes with the identified benefits of using ADR in research on project complexity management and gives recommendations for future research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Action research; Information systems; Project complexity",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132892231

However, scholars have long expressed concern that open innovation also entails a dark side, which can result in value co-destruction. This concern highlights the importance of devoting attention to the perils of pursuing open innovation. Existing scholarship has given due credence to these perils by examining various associated risks and uncertainties. We observe that the extant literature is siloed and unorganized, which impedes future research. Positing that an endeavor to organize existing studies may enhance the pace of research in the area, we attempt to address this gap by reviewing the relevant literature. We thus utilize the systematic literature review approach to identify, synthesize, and critically analyze 80 related research articles. Based on this analysis, we present the bibliometric profile of the extant research and a typology of five risks in open innovation: data-related risks, people-related risks, firm-level risks, outcome risks, and other risks. In addition, we discuss a specific risk management approach for each of the identified risks. Beyond providing a lucid narrative of the extant literature, we also identify unexplored avenues and offer an overarching framework to conceptualize future research potential in the area. From a practical perspective, managers can utilize this framework as a risk assessment tool when engaging in open innovation. In sum, this review—one of the first of its kind—offers a valuable consolidation of the state of the art of open innovation risk research, which can meaningfully advance theory and practice in the area. © 2022 The Authors","Open innovation; Risks; Systematic literature review; Uncertainties; Value co-creation","Risk management; Bibliometric; Open innovation; Related risk; Research potential; Risks and uncertainties; Risks management; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Uncertainty; Value co creations; Risk assessment",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132857594

Being transparent with certain information can make the potential buying process seem more incomprehensible to the customer. Most studies focus on different aspects of information disclosure in the case of product or price transparency. The impact of information transparency on data use and handling as well as the relevance of customers’ privacy concerns have often been disregarded. This study addresses the research questions of (1) how customers respond to a higher level of information transparency in the context of a service provider’s data use and handling in terms of purchase intention and willingness to pay and (2) the extent to which customer trust in a service provider has a significant mediating influence, and the associated privacy concerns a moderating influence, on the relationship between the level of information transparency of data use and handling and the customers’ purchase intention and willingness to pay. We base our study on the information processing model and privacy calculus theory and manipulate service providers’ communication on information transparency regarding data use and handling in online product presentations. In an online experiment (N = 142), it was found that an increase in information transparency triggers a decrease in the customers’ purchase intention and willingness to pay. Moreover, customers with high levels of privacy concerns seem to evaluate their purchase intention more critically when there was a low level of transparency, whereas, with a high level of transparency, customers with high and low privacy concerns hardly showed any difference. The results suggest that companies should communicate less about data use- and handling-related information when presenting products online. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","information transparency; Online product presentation; privacy concerns; purchase intention",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132802429

We consider the intersection of each transfer mechanism with important components of knowledge transfer (characteristics of sources/recipients, characteristics of knowledge, and characteristics of contexts). We present 15 exemplar articles, each of which reflects the intersection of a mechanism and a component of knowledge transfer. We also present an overview of the methodological approaches and empirical contexts that are utilized. We conclude our article with a discussion of future research opportunities.

In a laboratory experiment, we first find that subordinates continue to reciprocate if the outcome risk is high. Second, however, subordinates’ response to a well-intended action that increases outcome risk depends on their inequality aversion. Weakly inequality-averse subordinates repay a kind action with a kind reaction if it decreases, but not if it increases, their outcome risk, whereas strongly inequality-averse subordinates react alike in both cases. Hence, a well-intended action is less worthwhile for subordinates if it increases than if it decreases outcome risk. © 2022 European Accounting Association.","Gift-exchange game; Inequality aversion; Reciprocity; Risk",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132792925

Measures for supply chain risk management can minimize these recall risks. However, this responsibility must be shared by all stakeholders in the chain. This study aims to analyze the roles of different stakeholders in managing risks in the events of food recalls. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was carried out, and 110 articles were explored to identify risk management actions and to link them to the role of stakeholders involved in FSC recall. Findings: The study found that nine stakeholders were responsible for 25 hazard management actions related to food safety and traceability systems, regulatory and preventive measures, and control and response mechanisms for food recalls in the FSC. Originality/value: This article contributes to the literature by proposing an explanatory map associating risk management actions to different stakeholders in food recall. The actions were grouped according to whether they were prevention actions to avoid a food recall or contention actions to limit the negative economic effects and maintain the health of the population. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food recall; Food supply chain; Risk management; Stakeholder theory",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132741452

However, Reconfiguring, designing and developing green business models to become efficient and valuing Green Business Models have shown to be much more complex than expected. It includes balancing monetary and non monetary value formulas of business models in symbiosis. Not just for the single business – but for businesses in their entire value network. This includes security challenges related to securing that green business models really are green – and not based on greenwashing. As green business models demand in long term perspective a very open business model innovation approach, it calls for stronger and new security technologies. Protection of IPR’s of Business Models and businesses competences, so they are not one to one copied with out giving value back to “the Business Model designer” and the rightful original owner of the business models is a major security challenge related to green business models. Green Business Models and Green business Model Innovation calls therefore for new and more advanced security approach, technologies and understanding. Previous business model innovation security practice and systems cannot fully offer these solutions – but 6G of wide-area wireless security technologies – as an umbrella – gives hope and can potentially play major role with new security technologies supported by AI, AR and blockchain technologies. This evolvement is highly and urgent needed to support the success of our society’s green transformation.

Since its initial concepts in the early 1900s built upon extensive research of Nobel laureates such as Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Albert Einstein, and Richard Feynman, amongst others to the first proposed quantum computers by Paul Benioff in 1980, the concept of quantum technologies has evolved. Two central studies derived from quantum mechanics that can support and revolutionize future wireless technologies are quantum computers and quantum communications. The investigation for building the next generation of wireless networks has begun. Therefore, many technological opportunities for applying innovative solutions and advanced concepts are on the table as an option to unlock the full potential of 6G for providing an intelligent, superfast, and secure network. Having said that, quantum mechanics come into play to offer a breakthrough opportunity that will change the world since the popularization of the Internet, and it will propel 6G use cases to be remarkably successful, but only if quantum physics can be engineered and converged into the fore-mentioned quantum technologies to support the achievement of Society 5.0. Therefore, overcoming the quantum challenges, 6G can benefit in many ways. One of them is Quantum computing (QC) that will surpass the computational capabilities of classic computers limited by binary transactions known as bits to resolve future challenges using quantum states to process information in quantum bits (Qubits). Correspondingly, quantum computing will merge with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create a new model known as Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to deal with the exponential growth of Big Data faster than any existing computational model. In Addition, quantum communications will deliver a safer network, utilizing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and inaugurate the next generation of the Internet, much safer for all. Thus, this paper presents a holistic overview of Quantum as a service (QaaS) as a future deployment in the 6G architecture, but only if quantum technologies can be mastered in the next upcoming years. Most likely that QaaS will become available for commercial purposes by the hyperscalers, the ones able to cope with the total cost of ownership (TCO) of these state of art technologies. © 2022 River Publishers","6G; AI; big data; electromagnetic radiation; QaaS; quantum communications infrastructure (QCI); quantum computing; quantum key distribution (QKD); quantum machine learning; quantum mechanics; TCO","Atomic physics; Electromagnetic waves; Machine learning; Next generation networks; Quantum communication; Quantum computers; Quantum cryptography; Quantum optics; Statistical Physics; 6g; Communication infrastructure; Machine-learning; Quantum as a service; Quantum communication infrastructure; Quantum Computing; Quantum key distribution; Quantum machine learning; Quantum machines; Total cost of ownership; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132710408

To make sense of these new entry modes, they introduce a framework based on the exploitation–exploration distinction and on embeddedness. I first outline current thinking on the TCT theory of foreign entry modes and then review Brouthers et al.’s four novel entry modes, identifying what is genuinely new about them, and what is similar to what we already know. I conclude that these four modes constitute changes in kind rather than substance, and show that they have already been satisfactorily explained using TCT. In contrast, Brouthers et al.’s exploitation–exploration–embeddedness framework is unconvincing, because (a) exploration is not an appropriate term to describe the motivation of most resource and strategic asset acquisition foreign direct investment; (b) there is considerable variation in embeddedness within some of their four novel entry modes; and (c) the availability of intermediaries breaks the hypothesized one-to-one correspondence between need for embeddedness and entry mode. © 2022, The Author(s).","e-commerce or electronic commerce; embeddedness; exploration versus exploitation; foreign market entry; free-standing firms; transaction cost analysis; transaction cost economics; transaction cost theory",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132649496

Hacktivism and transactivism, we show, constitute rhetorical manoeuvres by which Manning performs (as) a subject position that combines an ethics of paranoia with an aesthetics of parody to enact politics as unusual. Beginning from Manning’s parodic paranoia, we conceptualize queer parrhesia as an inherently transgressive political style and discuss its performative potential for dismantling current social orders and imagining less orderly alternatives.

Standard personal financial advice suggests that homeownership should only be undertaken when one's job situation is stable and job movement is not likely in the near future. Little research has asked whether this advice is followed. Our goal is to rectify that omission. To test this hypothesis, we employ detailed information on workers and housing decisions from Danish administrative data. We construct a measure of job mismatch and find evidence, suggesting that homeowners are indeed better matched at their jobs than renters, and that an improved match leads renters to become homeowners. An examination of job durations suggests that homeownership is correlated with longer job duration both because of a direct causal effect and also due to an indirect effect through selection into homeownership. © 2022 American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association.","housing tenure; job match; labor market; search costs",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132568697

This is particularly true for a field such as global strategy where the ubiquity of the key terms invites indiscriminate use of the phrase. This essay argues that it is useful to define the field of global strategy as the subset of questions that meet the criteria for both “global” and “strategic” decisions. We offer an a priori approach to identifying and formulating problems that are unique to the global strategy field, suggest how our approach may help scholars better understand the “strategicness” of global decisions, and ultimately, offer a way for individuals with varied disciplinary or topical interests to connect with the field's core. Managerial Summary: It has been observed that few executives can clearly articulate their firm's global strategy. This observation is disappointing given the development of theoretical insights from the fields of international business and strategic management that suggest alternative ways in which organizations can reliably and repeatedly create, capture, and deliver value. The existence of this shortcoming suggests that it will be beneficial to develop unambiguous statements that define what constitutes a global, a strategic, and a globally strategic decision. This essay offers a priori definitions of these terms in the hope of helping individuals both consider the unique and distinctive elements of global strategy and better understand the core decisions that guide an organization's pursuit of its global objectives, scope, and sources of advantage. © 2022 The Authors.

The management of construction and demolition waste, however, struggles to apply these measures. Our purpose, therefore, is to analyse how different actors involved in the management of waste could contribute to transform existing practices so that they respond to the shifting demands of legislation and support CE. To understand how this transformation work is performed, we build on the concept of institutional work, which enables us to describe how actors, rather than accepting institutions as permanent and immovable, contribute to their development by creating, maintaining or disrupting the existing institution. Drawing on qualitative research methods, we collected empirical data through 31 semi-structured interviews, observations of meetings and site visits. Our results show that whereas the production of waste is somewhat reduced, and the sorting of fractions improved, the institutional work performed is not sufficient to translate sustainability into new economic values. Although the work performed legitimizes CE principles and enables new initiatives, it mostly fails to change normative associations and to define new rules of action that support CE. © 2022 The Author(s).

Second, we review a corpus of literature reviews published between 2015 and 2020. Third, we review key concepts, models, and theories as they have been developed recently in social media and crisis communication research. We focus in particular on the SMCC model and the NCC model.

We analyze the firms’ delisting decisions from this market segment between 2003 and 2015, with a focus on different delisting reasons and firm characteristics. We identify 518 firms that listed on the Prime Standard at least once during the sample period of which 243 firms left this market segment. Of these firms, 107 down-listed and transferred to lower market segments and 136 firms exited the public equity market for the following reasons: 61 firms merged, 53 were insolvent, and 22 firms went private. Using cross-sectional and firm-fixed effects logit regressions, we provide new evidence for firms’ market segment and delisting decisions. Consistent with a cost–benefit analysis, we observe that inferior growth opportunities, low stock liquidity, smaller firm size, poor operating performance, higher audit fees, and more agency conflicts increase the probability that firms opt for a less regulated stock market segment or voluntarily go private.

The starting point for ethical business is the existential commitment with the ethical vision of the good life in business and organizations. The hermeneutic study of humanity of business focusses on the historicity of temporal narrative identities of meaning and forms of action of individuals, cultures and collectivities in organizations. Organizations are viewed as political communities and concepts from political philosophy are important to capture the humanity of business. Ricœur sees the desire to live together according to universal norms as the foundation of the just community, business or organization. This is an important normative dimension of the critical hermeneutic study of organizations. A good organization or a good society opens for personal search for the good life. Individual ethics is based on ontological commitment, responsibility, promise and integrity of narrative identity of individuals in community. The market system should facilitate the good political community and market interactions should be built on the virtues and norms as the foundation of search of excellence. Moreover, the firm or corporation may be viewed as a form of life or a culture of excellence, which must combine the vision of the good life of personal and collective narrative identity with respect for the moral norm and co-existence in the ethical life and mutual recognition of just organizations. Business and society are characterized by conflictual-consensual interactions, tensions between individuals and community, between individual autonomy and norms of community. These confront individuals and organizations in challenges of economic man versus social man, profit versus sustainability, responsibility versus efficiency, truth versus organizational obligation, personal integrity versus commitment to business standards and tensions between organizational commitments and individual beliefs. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Hermeneutics; Just institutions; Paul Ricœur; Political communities",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131797997

We discuss two strategies of resource mobilization. (1) The circular strategy, which is mainly applied by social ventures, leverages community narratives and support for crowdfunding campaigns to strengthen and expand the very community support the campaigns are based on. (2) The cumulative strategy, which is mainly applied by commercial high-tech ventures, mobilizes the symbolic value of local institutional ties to attract crowdfunding backers and uses crowdfunding success to attract new resource-holders in local ecosystems.

Remote work can offer a physically distant environment and greater flexibility for individual employees and organizations; remote work also creates or exacerbates potential work-life balance tensions. Drawing on Job-Demands Resources theory, we propose that two organizational resources, instrumental leadership (a vertical organizational resource) and a sense of social belonging (a horizontal organizational resource), help prevent burnout by alleviating conflict between work- and family-life activities. Using survey responses from local government employees collected during the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020), we show that employees with a strong sense of social belonging experience less work-family conflict and, in turn, report lower levels of burnout.

When allocating resources to these initiatives, senior headquarters managers face uncertainty that they attempt to address using various heuristics, which may bias allocation. Name-based heuristics – cognitive shortcuts based on names associated with a decision-making situation – have been shown to influence financial decisions ranging from food purchase to stock investment. Yet little is known about name-based heuristics in the allocation of financial resources to entrepreneurial initiatives. We analyse 1308 resource allocation decisions made by 109 senior managers in an experiment in which we vary subsidiary country and subsidiary manager names. We find that psychic distance to the subsidiary country is negatively related to resource allocation when subsidiary managers' names express a potential expatriate status. In contrast, this relationship is positive when subsidiary managers' names express a potential local status. We contextualize our results by interviewing senior managers and discuss how reliance on name-based heuristics to infer the context of an initiative or the interests and competences of subsidiary managers can lead to biased decisions. © 2022 The Authors.

While the idea of freeing students from the weight of grades sounds promising, grades are so integral to the educational system that the effects of learning without grades may not provide the relief intended. In this article, we present a qualitative case study of how business and management students experienced having gradeless learning in their first year of an undergraduate program. Our data show that students felt true ambivalence about learning without grades. Although gradeless learning was associated with less pressure, higher motivation, and a more collaborative approach to learning, it also engendered feelings of identity loss and uncertainty among students about their own performance and future opportunities. Our study contributes to previous studies on the impact of grades by revealing the ambivalence experienced by students when learning without the well-known metric of grades in a performance culture. Moreover, it provides new empirical insights into how business and management students experience gradeless learning. © The Author(s) 2022.","Ambivalence; business and management education; gradeless learning; grades; transition",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131551787

Few researchers have previously studied early-stage maintenance clustering. Experience from product and service development has shown that early stages are critical to the development process, as most decisions are made during these stages. Similarly, most maintenance decisions are made during the early stages of maintenance development. Developing maintenance for clustering is expected to increase the potential of clustering. Design/methodology/approach: A literature study and three case studies using the same data set were performed. The case studies simulate three stages of maintenance development by clustering based on the changes available at each given stage. Findings: The study indicates an increased impact of maintenance clustering when clustering already in the first maintenance development stage. By performing clustering during the identification phase, 4.6% of the planned work hours can be saved. When clustering is done in the planning phase, 2.7% of the planned work hours can be saved. When planning is done in the scheduling phase, 2.4% of the planned work hours can be saved. The major difference in potential from the identification to the scheduling phase came from avoiding duplicate, unnecessary and erroneous work. Originality/value: The findings from this study indicate a need for more studies on early-stage maintenance clustering, as few others have studied this. © 2022, Julie Krogh Agergaard, Kristoffer Vandrup Sigsgaard, Niels Henrik Mortensen, Jingrui Ge and Kasper Barslund Hansen.","Knowledge management; Maintenance cost management; Maintenance performance; Maintenance process; Productivity","Costs; Knowledge management; Scheduling; Case-studies; Clusterings; Cost management; Development process; Maintenance cost; Maintenance cost management; Maintenance performance; Maintenance process; Product and service development; Work hours; Maintenance",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131538822

Many countries are facing economic structural changes in the form of resource allocation changing from traditional to technologically advanced sectors, which directly affects sectoral share and productivity. Resource allocation that is considered structural change also takes place through innovation activities. This paper attempts to explain the impact of innovation on productivity, which is moderated by structural change. Ignoring such a moderation effect may cause over- or underestimation of the true effect. Using a global sample from 1996 to 2013 for a panel of 65–87 countries with treatments for endogeneity (2SLS and system GMM), we find a positive significant effect of innovation on both structural change weighted productivity and unweighted average productivity, and that the effect on structural change weighted productivity is larger. We also find this effect to differ in economies experiencing different structural transition phases and income levels. Our results are robust across alternative measures of structural change, such as diversity measure and natural resource share in GDP. © 2022","Knowledge-innovation; Labour productivity; Structural changes","Economics; Resource allocation; Change analysis; Endogeneity; Global perspective; Innovation activity; Knowledge innovation; Labour productivities; Productivity growth; Resources allocation; Structural change; System GMM; Productivity",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131456244

The presence of loss aversion causes the separating equilibrium (without discontinuities in the distribution of reported earnings) to disappear, while the partially-pooling equilibrium (exhibiting discontinuities) may prevail. This implies that the presence of loss-averse investors will cause earnings discontinuities around reference points.

Dealers have established themselves, and mediate these markets through their use of quality signals. While these signals help to mitigate information asymmetries, these markets still function well below their optimum: a large share of goods sold are overpriced, and most of the benefits are reaped by intermediaries. In this paper we build on prior research that proposes the use of blockchain as an enabler for trusted, decentralized asset documentation. Applying a socio-technical lens, we describe how blockchain-enabled multi-party certification affords dealers the action potential to send signals that are more closely correlated to the unobservable quality of the underlying good (i.e., signals with a higher fit) than the signals they send today. We then both theorize and experimentally explore the market effects of the two types of signals. Using data from a laboratory market experiment with 210 participants, we find empirical evidence that multi-party certification affords dealers the action potential to send signals of significantly higher fit than those sent by intermediaries alone, leading to a reduction in information asymmetries, a more efficient allocation of goods, and an increase in market fairness. © 2022 The Author(s).

The quantitative approach was applied using a cross section design surveying 113 MFIs in Uganda. Data analysis used descriptive statistics, cross tabulations and partial least square modelling. The results showed that two of the components of the intrapreneurial environment ('organization motivation to innovate' and 'intrapreneurial resources') had a positive significant relationship with innovation. 'Intrapreneurial management practices' did not have a significant relationship with innovation. Overall, the intrapreneurial environment had a positive significant relationship with innovation.

This study seeks to provide additional insights into the nature of these factors and how they influence the growth process of small businesses in rural communities in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: This study undertook a qualitative investigation of 28 small enterprises in three Ghanaian rural districts. Interviews were conducted with owners of the businesses. Findings: The results indicate that growth-enabling conditions such as entrepreneurial ambition, market demand and infrastructure combine with finance to define small enterprise growth trajectories in rural Ghana. However, finance may not always be the major factor driving the growth. Originality/value: Most past studies about small enterprise growth in Africa have concentrated on firms in urban communities and see finance gap as the most serious constraint to growth. This study joins the few recent studies about rural enterprise growth in Ghana, showing that the growth of these businesses depends on an interplay of a variety of factors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Africa; Entrepreneurship; Financial inclusion; Firm growth; Ghana; Rural communities; Small business finance; Small enterprises",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131214930

To gain and sustain competitive advantages, small businesses traditionally had to choose between cost leadership and differentiation strategies. Digital technologies enable small businesses to reduce their costs and at the same time enhance the value of their market offerings through differentiation. The aim of this paper is to explain the role of digital technologies in such hybrid strategies for small businesses. We first identify automation, individualization and interdisciplinarity as the three dimensions of digital technologies that together enable technology-driven firms to gain and sustain competitive advantages and to scale rapidly. Second, we integrate these three dimensions into a theoretical framework.

While such strategies typically involve shifting blame to political opponents or other governments, we examine how they might direct blame to ethnic groups. We focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, where the Trump administration sought to shift blame by scapegoating (using the term “Chinese virus”) and mitigate blame by positively framing performance information on COVID-19 testing. Using a novel experimental design that leverages machine learning techniques, we find scapegoating outgroups backfired, leading to greater blame of political leadership for the poor administrative response, especially among conservatives. Backlash was strongest for negatively framed performance data, demonstrating that performance framing shapes blame avoidance outcomes.

To retain third-party sellers in the face of competitive pressure from rivals, e-marketplace platforms are compelled to provide support for online-offline channel integration (OOCI). However, the provision of OOCI support can adversely affect an OOCI-enabled platform's product sales growth by encouraging consumers to switch to brick-and-mortar stores operated by third-party sellers. To ascertain how the OOCI-enabled platform can outperform under such circumstances, we analyzed data on sales of 51,409 products on a dominant Chinese e-marketplace platform as well as inter-platform function usage difference across 209 third-party sellers. Combining propensity score matching with hierarchical linear modeling, we discovered that informational OOCI (e.g., concurrent availability of a product on both online and offline channels) negatively influences the OOCI-enabled platform's product sales growth, whereas the effect of physical OOCI (e.g., the option of store pickup for online purchases) is not significant. Additionally, we found that the three constituent sub-dimensions of third-party sellers' inter-platform function usage difference (i.e., volume difference, category orientation specialization, and uniqueness) moderate the impact of OOCI on the OOCI-enabled platform's product sales growth differently. Findings from this study thus yield actionable guidelines for e-marketplace platforms pursuing omni-channel retailing strategies. © 2022 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.","E-marketplace platform; hierarchical linear model; information integration; inter-platform function usage difference; physical integration","Commerce; Integral equations; Sales; E-marketplace platform; E-marketplaces; Hierarchical linear models; Information integration; Inter-platform function usage difference; Offline channel; Physical integration; Product sales; Sales growth; Third parties; Integration",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85131168465

However, MNCs often adopt theoretically misaligned governance modes. Applying a prospect theory (PT) perspective, we use the context of business-process offshoring to explore why firms choose misaligned governance modes. We argue that theoretically misaligned governance modes are regarded as riskier than aligned governance modes, and we suggest that prior experiences of failure in an international context—especially in business functions that are relevant for the internationalization of a firm—prompt decision-makers to choose theoretically misaligned governance modes. We enhance discussions on governance-mode decisions with important behavioral perspectives on how such decisions materialize. Managerial Summary: Experience with underperforming investments provides decision-makers with an important motivation to search for riskier, nontraditional solutions, such as governance modes that do not necessarily comply with conventional logics. We show that such decisions, which have traditionally been conceived as managerial mistakes, are driven by behavioral insights found in the fields of human and organizational psychology. While we explore this idea in the context of international governance-mode decisions, we believe such a behavioral perspective on international decision-making is generalizable to other relevant contexts. © 2022 The Authors.

Despite the relevance of the subject, a challenge for practitioners is the development of a strategy aimed to increase the level of reconfigurability with long-term goals of customisation and responsiveness. Moreover, traditional manufacturing paradigms are disrupted by the transformation of manufacturing systems in cyber-physical systems (CPS), thus introducing innovative means also to increase the level of reconfigurability in manufacturing systems. This study investigates how the technologies underlying CPS support the reconfigurability capability along system life cycle. Thus the technologies underlying CPS are classified into seven categories and it is shown how they enable the sequence of utilisation of the reconfigurability characteristics (modularity, integrability, diagnosability, scalability, convertibility and customisation) along the system life cycle. The results of the study can guide practitioners in developing reconfigurability as a strategic capability.

The objective of this review is to examine the concept of moral licensing in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) covering the period from 2012 to 2021. First, our research explains why moral licensing is defined differently across CSR contexts. Second, we illustrate how CSR practices precede moral licensing and misconduct among top executives and employees (List & Momeni, 2021; Ormiston & Wong, 2013). Third, findings suggest that currently underexplored variables moderate the relationship between CSR and moral licensing, including the moral identity symbolization of CEOs and the style of CSR communication. Fourth, we suggest that very few studies have addressed these potentially negative effects of CSR. In conclusion, this review offers an initial overview on moral licensing, examines implications for practice, proposes extensions to existing theory, and sets an agenda for future research. © 2022 The Authors.","CSIR; CSR; Misconduct; Moral Licensing; SLR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130571839

We explore why rational managers engage in misreporting despite the costly consequences. To guide our analysis, we build a parsimonious model of reporting bias and the cost of restating. In our model, the observed cost of a restatement conveys information about the true cost of biasing financial statements, which the manager incorporates into the optimal choice of bias. A restatement hence offers managers an opportunity to learn about the true cost of reporting bias, which allows them to update their biasing strategy if the observed cost differs from the expected. We test the model's predictions by analyzing how firms' accruals quality changes after observing the costs attached to restating, which we measure as the market loss following a restatement scaled by the restatement's net income effect. We find that future accruals quality is increasing in the cost of restating and the change in the cost of restating. Consistent with our stylized model, our results indicate that rational managers use the insights from prior restatements to improve their future bias strategy. © 2022 The Authors.

It also helps to protect the environment and optimize usage of input resources. The main element of circular economy is closed-loop supply chain which covers both forward and reverse products flows. This study aims to outsource logistics operations in a closed-loop supply chain. An innovative analytical multi-step fuzzy decision-making method is proposed to rank sustainable third-party logistics service providers (3PLSPs). Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) is first used to evaluate the relationships among the main criteria. Then, fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) is applied to weight the determined set of criteria. In order to develop the hybrid fuzzy DEMATEL-ANP method and to simplify the computation, the expert judgment method is used between the two techniques as a middle step to reduce the number of criteria. As many of the criteria overlap with each other on content and context, expert opinions are used to shortlist and rank the criteria. Finally, the 3PLSPs are ranked through the fuzzy complex proportional assessment (COPRAS) method. To validate the practicability and applicability of the improved decision-making model, a household appliance case study is applied with data obtained from industry experts. In this case, five service providers are considered and ranked, while the first one gets the best score. A sensitivity analysis is performed by altering the criteria weights to validate the proposed approach, data, and the obtained results. In terms business and the environment, this study provides success critical criteria for decision-making problems in circular economy for addressing sustainable development. © 2022 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: The concept of maturity models is adopted to support companies in developing distinctive capabilities for servitization. A systematic literature review and case study approach are employed to develop the maturity model. Findings: The findings highlight 46 capabilities classified into seven categories: strategy and leadership, performance, offerings, customers, organization, network and digital technology. Furthermore, the evolutionary path is defined by combining two types of levels, i.e. capability and maturity levels, to develop these capabilities. Research limitations/implications: The evolutionary path was partially validated through the application, while further investigation is required to validate the evolutionary path. Therefore, future research should investigate the further validation of the evolutionary path by conducting multiple case studies. Practical implications: The proposed maturity model enables companies to not only capture the bigger picture of the required capabilities without oversight, but also determine a process for improving the requisite capabilities with feasible efforts. Originality/value: Existing maturity models focused on the transition from less to more advanced services. However, recent studies emphasized that companies need to determine strategies that reflect their capabilities rather than simply move toward more advanced services. Based on this assumption, this study provides successive stages that enable companies to improve their capabilities through feasible efforts. © 2022, Koji Kimita, Tim C.

Democratic enterprises have in recently been subject of increasing interest from scholars and activists as an alternative to the neoliberal corporation. However, studies on democratic enterprises lack a historical understanding of the constitution of the democratic sector of the economy and an analytical approach todistinguish between different types of democratic enterprises. Drawing on Weberian methodology and using Denmark as historical-empirical vantage point, the paper distinguishes four ideal typical socio-economic motivations for constituting a democratic enterprise: the Proudhonian (liberation from socio-economic domination), Smithian (improving commercial leverage), Polanyian (protection against ravages of market society), and Hirstian (realizing cultural-ideological aims of voluntary associations). The paper uses a recent data set (n = 5,864) measuring the performance of the Danish ‘democratic enterprise sector’ as the starting point to argue that a better informed historical as well as theoretical approach is needed in order to comprehend this increasingly important organizational form. We conclude by discussing the relevance of the findings beyond Denmark, arguing for more appreciation of the history and the potentials of a variegated organizational ecology that combines different socio-economic ideals. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cooperativism; democratic enterprises; Denmark; social economy; workplace democracy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130008148

It presents the findings of an ethnographic study of strategizing in the highly complex context of the digital transformation journey of a global manufacturing firm.

This longitudinal case study is theoretically informed by literature on decoupling and recoupling to account for these actors' efforts. The case studied demonstrates that recoupling actors draw on three modes of action—discursive, material, and relational—to address the two forms of decoupling identified by Bromley and Powell [2012.

This study contributes to current research in three ways. First, it unpacks risk experts' efforts to address different forms of decoupling, reinvigorating debates on recoupling. Second, it shows that ideal-typical ERM is shaped by a succession of external templates. Third, it draws attention to the preeminent role of double-embedded actors who link successive templates to enable the formation of an organizational ERM that is consistent with the field-level ideal type. Together, these findings contrast with those of previous studies that argued that ERM working ensembles are inexorably inconsistent with the ideal type. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Decoupling; Double embeddedness; Enterprise risk management; Modes of action; Recoupling work",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129932617

Recent research has emphasized mapping of stakeholders and values as a starting point for identifying opportunities to realign these relationships, followed by business model experimentation to enable change. However, a simple mapping exercise does not consider the interplay between actors' concerns, business models, and interpretations of sustainability. Pedersen et al. (2022) advocated that aligning concerns is essential to collaborative design and innovation, and requires continuous negotiation between multiple actors. Here, we present a microlevel in-depth case study to examine how alignment across central value chain actors may be facilitated through the staging of numerous negotiations during the innovation process. Drawing on the staging negotiation spaces co-design framework, we provide insight into the content of multiple negotiations concerned with different aspects of sustainability during the development of a more sustainable laundry service system on the Danish island of Bornholm.

In this study, we build on performance feedback theory and the concept of problemistic search to examine the extent to which firms move offshored service activities to new countries when facing negative performance gaps. We also examine if these relocations take place within a search space limited by the managers' cognitive span. We formulate a set of hypotheses revolving around this idea of search within a limited space. Our hypotheses are supported when tested on a sample of global sourcing projects undertaken by 223 firms between 1995 and 2012. Managerial summary: The essence of reconfiguration is the continuous search for efficient combinations of functions, local service providers (when functions are outsourced), governance modes, and—in our case—locations. Limiting the search for improved combinations to fewer locations entails a higher dependence on these locations maintaining the country-location-specific advantages that made them attractive in the first place. It is thus possible that multinational enterprise (MNE) managers who reconfigure their GVC in a geographically bounded way in the long run will struggle to compete with MNEs that search for optimality within a broader range of locations as possible remedies for the GVC operations that experience negative performance gaps. © 2022 The Authors.

The study used the supply chain operations reference (SCOR) model to select the key operational stages of the supply chain and the measurement criteria. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) prioritized the phases and criteria and developed the expected performance of the feed supply chain. By comparing the expected performance and the perceived current performance, we identified the performance gap in the feed supply chain. The transaction costs were calculated separately. The study found that high costs were the main reason for low performance in the feed supply chain. The reliability of the product quality was also a concerning issue in the chain. Compared to other actors in the chain, dealers are the low performers. The study suggests performance can be improved by developing direct channels between manufacturers and farmers, thereby omitting dealers and concentrating on local raw material production. The study also demonstrated that transaction costs play an important role in the performance of the supply chain. This study is the first to empirically examine this situation and is innovative in that its examination of the feed supply chain included transaction costs. © 2022 Operations and Supply Chain Management Forum.

Unexpectedly, empirical evidence on food festivals aimed at reviving local cuisine in non-Western countries is scarce. This study aimed to examine and clarify the concept of food culture attributes on visitors' satisfaction and patronage intention in a food festival setting to revive local foods. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative approach was used. Convenience sampling and questionnaires were administered to 172 attendees as the final response to a food festival. The conceptual framework identifies the assumptions of structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings: Food culture attributes significantly impacted visitor satisfaction based on the results. Cooking methods had an insignificant influence on satisfaction and indirect effects on patronage intention. Additionally, the authors persuaded satisfaction to act as a mediator, and food culture was a significant contributor to the hypothesised framework. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first empirical studies to employ food culture attributes (flavour, presentation, cooking method and gastronomic identification) and patronage intention in the mediating role of satisfaction with Iranian cultural heritage as a revival of a visitor’s attraction towards local cuisine. The results revealed that the resurrection of local dishes serves as an alternative truth that aids in preserving Iranian cultural heritage. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Food culture attributes; Food tourism festival; Iran; Revival of local food","article; conceptual framework; convenience sample; cooking; empiricism; flavor; human; human experiment; inheritance; Iran; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; satisfaction; structural equation modeling; tourism",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129366847

One of the strategically important and challenging decision areas for planning and control in ETO environments is estimating and quoting feasible delivery dates and assessing the feasibility of customer-imposed delivery dates, collectively referred to as delivery date setting (DDS). While DDS has received substantial attention in literature, research supporting the process in ETO companies is fragmented–lacking clear guidelines for industrial practice and gaps to guide future research on the topic. To address these issues, this study systematically reviews literature supporting DDS in ETO environments, identifying tools and practices proposed in the extant literature, and proposing an agenda for future research. Findings suggest that most of the research has focused on developing planning and decision-support tools for tactical capacity planning to support reliable DDS, however, with a noticeable lack of alignment with industrial decision-support needs of ETO environments. Furthermore, despite previous research emphasising the importance of high levels of coordination and formalisation in the DDS process, there is a lack of research to guide practitioners in achieving high levels of coordination and formalisation. © 2022 The Author(s).

We find that increased levels of commensuration have moved sustainability reporting away from an original emphasis on morality and values to a focus on strategic value creation for the firm. We theorize this process as a “crowding out of morality” that is enabled by a rigid cognitive framing of social and environmental issues (objectification) and the monetized coordination of relevant social interactions (marketization).

Acknowledging that the likely responses will be shaped by the educational systems in nation states and regions, where and how VET is positioned within them and the kinds and range of influences shaping young people and their parent and familiars’ decision-making about VET. Across these countries, both with developed and developing economic bases, it would seem that high aspirations and, increasingly, expectations of young people and their parents and other familiars is quite consistently positioning VET as being an inferior postschool option to participation in higher education (HE) and one that is seen as being posterior to it in terms of status, attractiveness and educational outcomes. Addressing and rebutting such strong societal sentiments about the forms of work and an educational provision that are seen as undesirable will likely require addressing these circumstances locally and regionally. As VET is strongly aligned with occupations, making it more interesting, engaging and attractive to young people is also closely linked with the standing of occupations. So, there is a need to find ways to redress the concerns within the community and address the factors which limit the ability of VET to deliver its full potential to students, communities and nations. So, in sum, this chapter sets out this case drawing upon the collective contributions in this volume and a wider range of literature that addresses these challenges. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Approaches; Decision-making support; Distal influences; Local factors; Proximal influences; Strategies; Zone of influence",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128930110

Too few young people enrol in VET directly after lower secondary education, and only around half of the students who enrol in a VET programme complete their studies. A reform of VET from 2014 proposed a set of initiatives to address these two challenges. However, studies have shown that, in general, these initiatives have not resulted in improvements in either enrolment or completion rates. This led to yet another reform of VET in 2018 that included an additional set of initiatives. Based on accounts of the poor effects of the 2014 reform’s initiatives and acknowledging that there is no simple solution to either the low intake or the high dropout, this chapter focuses on two factors that are particularly important for efforts to increase both enrolment and completion rates. These two factors are ‘attractive learning environments’ and ‘students’ decision-making skills, targeting three issues: (i) What constitutes an attractive VET learning environment for young people? (ii) What characterises VET students’ decisions and decision-making process? and (iii) How are students’ ability to make decisions and their perceptions of the training environment interrelated? © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Decision-making skills; Drop-out; Enrolment; Guidance; Reforms; Standing; Teacher competences; Training and learning environment; VET; Youth education",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128920415

The article finds that while the MCDF contributes to closing the substantial infrastructure financing gap in Asia, it risks overlapping with existing initiatives to such a degree that it may become an inefficient use of resources while lacking legitimacy as a multilateral organisation due to its unclear relationship with Chinaʼs Belt and Road Initiative.

The dysfunctionality of performance measures often reflects how the measures prevent an organisation from achieving its goals. This paper proposes that perceptions of dysfunctionality can be analysed by separating the perceptions of the programme's intentions, of the school-level actions and of the outcomes for students. Design/methodology/approach: Following a qualitative methodology, semi-structured interviews were conducted with teachers, school management, staff specialists and top management in a large Danish municipality when outcome-based funding was introduced. Findings: The performance-funding programme affected teaching by changing educational priorities. Different perceptions of the (dys)functionality of intentions, actions and outcomes fuelled diverging responses. Although the performance measure was generally considered incomplete, interviewees' perceptions of the financial incentivisation and the dysfunctionality of actions depended on interpretations of the incentivisation and student-related outcomes of the programme. Research limitations/implications: Dysfunctionality can be contested; the interpretations of the intention of a performance-funding programme affect the perceived dysfunctionality of reactions. Both technical characteristics of funding schemes and administrators' and principals' mediating roles are essential for the consequences of performance funding. Originality/value: The paper examines conditions for dysfunctionality of performance measures. We demonstrate that actions can be perceived as dysfunctional because of a measurement's intentions, actions themselves and the actions' outcomes. Further, the paper illustrates how the reception of performance funding depends on how consequences are enacted based on educators' interpretations of the (dys)functionality of intentions, actions and outcomes. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Dysfunctionality; Incentives; Intentions and actions; Performance funding; Public sector; Unintended consequences",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128765320

Using archival data and measures established by Flyvbjerg and colleagues, we find that cost and schedule overrun is substantially lower than reported in previous studies. Qualitative analysis based on interviews and documents in a purposefully selected sub-sample shows that projects are more likely to be completed within budget and schedule if managers actively adopt four key practices: building one team, accommodating uncertainty, rigorous project management and capitalizing on previous domain knowledge. Our findings also suggest that scope reductions may help projects complete within budget and schedule.

In this article, we provide guidance on how to make the best use of the information available by assessing projects against several appropriate factors and allocating scores. Although companies have used this type of scoring method for many years, they have paid little attention to how to best design and configure scoring tools. We explain how to design a scoring tool specifically tailored for a particular situation and present the example of Grundfos to illustrate the efficacy of developing a customized scoring method that includes identifying factors under Opportunity and Feasibility. We suggest how to choose the factors to ensure that the scoring is as consistent and objective as possible and how to treat the inevitable uncertainty arising from early-stage projects. © Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

Participants on these platforms often self-organize into ad-hoc virtual teams to compete in such tournaments. Social dominance-based faultlines, which originate from the alignment of members based on IT-enabled social dominance attributes (e.g., rank and tier), have emerged as a novel type of faultline in crowdsourcing teams. Building on the Categorization-Elaboration Model (CEM), we investigate the contingent effects of team ability and team effort on the relationship between social dominance-based faultlines and team performance in crowdsourcing tournaments. We collected data of 265 virtual teams from Kaggle.com. We discovered that IT-enabled social dominance-based faultlines positively influence the performance of teams with low ability and high effort, whereas the effect becomes negative for teams with high ability and low effort. Our study yields theoretical implications by advancing a novel type of social dominance-based faultline and extending the CEM with two contingent factors (i.e., team effort and team ability) pertinent to team performance on crowdsourcing tournaments.

In this study, we use data from 171 pairs of expatriate academics and their local academic collaboration partners. We asked the local academic peers to rate expatriate academics' reputation, their local and English language skills, and collaboration performance. As expected, we found a positive association between academic reputation and collaboration performance. In line with analyses from qualitative research, we show a moderation effect of language skills, where high common organizational language (English) proficiency compensates for a weaker perceived reputation in predicting collaboration performance.

However, it remains unclear to what extent purchasing of sustainable products as a form of sustainable consumer behavior indeed impacts the consumers’ sustainable mindset. Although existing research provides comprehensive insights into both the determinants of sustainable consumer behavior (White et al. 2019) and the effects of sustainable business strategies (e.g., Olsen et al. 2014), extant research largely fails to study the consequences of consumer behavior (Pham 2015). In particular, knowledge is scarce on how sustainable consumer behavior and more specifically the purchasing of sustainable food affect the individual and more specifically the self-identity as a sustainable consumer. In other words, on the backdrop of the embodied cognition theory (Krueger 2013; Shapiro 2011), which states that bodily engagement (i.e., action) shapes both, the character and the content of consciousness, this article sheds light on how sustainable consumer behavior (i.e., organic and fair-trade food purchases) affects consumers’ consciousness for sustainable consumption (CSC). The findings of actual purchase data of both organic and fair-trade food products of 3,358 German households reveal that organic food purchases exert a positive effect on consumers’ CSC while the fair-trade purchases do not. However, fair-trade purchases promote CSC with an increasing age. More specifically, seniors compare to young and middle-aged consumer consider fair-trade purchases to define their CSC. In addition, the positive relationship between organic food purchase and environmental CSC is significantly stronger for young than for middle-aged purchasers. This work has significant implications for practitioners on how to improve consumers’ CSC. Marketers on the one hand should therefore continue to promote and facilitate sustainable purchases (i.e., organic and fair-trade food purchases). Promoting this behavior should be realized in a targeted way. For instance, marketers should put further emphasis on the fair-trade food promotion for senior customers in order to activate CSC and therefore stimulating and amplifying the “foot in the door” strategy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Consciousness; Embodied cognition theory; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable food purchases",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127991229

We integrate ideas from the social contagion and social network dynamics literatures to support our coevolutionary theory. To test our theory, we collected longitudinal data at three time points from 135 employees in a customer-facing research-and-development department. We employ a stochastic actor-oriented model that allows the simultaneous modeling of changes in work-based social network ties, emotional job demands, and employee performance. We find a social contagion effect whereby employees are more at risk of an increase in their emotional job demands, the more reciprocal work-based social relationships they have with colleagues who have high emotional job demands. In addition, individuals with high emotional job demands change their networks in two notable ways: They have a positive tendency for having work-based social ties, that is, sociability, and for having ties with others with high emotional job demands, that is, homophily. However, despite the unintended consequence of these network tendencies making employees more susceptible to the contagion effect of emotional job demands, we also find support for the buffering hypothesis. The negative effect of high emotional job demands on performance is lower for employees who have more work-based social ties. © The Author(s) 2022.","contagion; emotional job demands; job demands–resources model; networks; performance",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127785247

Nonetheless, its benefits may be lessened in sparse settings due to weak predictors, and a pre-estimation dimension reduction (targeting) step is required. We show that proper targeting controls the probability of placing splits along strong predictors, thus providing an important complement to RF's feature sampling. This is supported by simulations using finite representative samples. Moreover, we quantify the immediate gain from targeting in terms of the increased strength of individual trees. Macroeconomic and financial applications show that the bias–variance trade-off implied by targeting, due to increased correlation among trees in the forest, is balanced at a medium degree of targeting, selecting the best 5%–30% of commonly applied predictors. Improvements in the predictive accuracy of targeted RF relative to ordinary RF are considerable, up to 21%, occurring both in recessions and expansions, particularly at long horizons. © 2022 International Institute of Forecasters","High-dimensional forecasting; Random forests; Targeted predictors; Variable selection; Weak predictors",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127717769

Therefore, this article aimed to propose a strategic planning decision framework oriented to circular business models (SPDF-CBM) and test it by conducting a case study of a Brazilian company from the cosmetic sector. The SPDF-CBM framework comprises five stages: (A) circular trends analysis; (B) circular vision and goals definition; (C) current circular business status; (D) competitive strategy for a circular economy definition; and (E) competitive strategies for a circular economy prioritization. Based on a number of tools to assist going through Stages A, B, and C, businesses get to know their current circular status and define their desired future state. In Stages D and E, businesses define their competitive strategy and spot circular business models (and strategies) they can pursue. After testing the proposed framework in a Brazilian startup from the cosmetic sector, results from SPDF-CBM suggested that the startup pursues a competitive strategy based on differentiation and a CBM aimed at promoting renewable options. It was also pointed out that other CBMs in decreasing degree of fit with the business were maximizing material and energy efficiency, extending resource value and product life, pursuing sufficiency, and delivering functionality rather than ownership. By using the SPDF-CBM framework, organizations can increase both their competitiveness and circularity at the same time. © 2022 The Authors.

Using survey data from employees and their supervisors from a wide variety of organizations, we found that leader creative expectations were more strongly related to idea generation than to problem construction and to information search and encoding. Job autonomy, in contrast, was significantly related to problem construction, but not to information search and encoding or idea generation. Furthermore, we found that although idea generation is positively related to both radical and incremental creativity, problem construction is only positively related to radical creativity.

Among these circular manufacturing strategies, “3R” (recycle, refurbish/remanufacture, and reuse/redistribute) is the key strategy that assists the manufacturing industry with closing the loop for sustainability. An effective inclusion and management of 3R lead a firm to a greater likelihood of successfully integrating CE and CM. In recent years, remanufacturing has gained greater prominence, especially with the emergence of technology, including cyber-physical systems. These technologies assist the remanufacturing firm with efficient take-back systems through tracking. However, data transferred through these technologies among value chain partners in remanufacturing are not reliable. Due to the lack of trust and transparency, value chain partners are hesitant to participate in remanufacturing supply chains. To address the limitation of technologies in remanufacturing, blockchain has been introduced to secure the data. Despite the advantages of blockchain technology, practitioners face difficulties in integrating these blockchain technologies into the remanufacturing context. Several earlier studies addressed the challenges of implementing blockchain, but no earlier studies have specifically examined remanufacturing industries, which are entirely different from forward supply chain industries. Concerning the fact, this study identifies the barriers that exist with the implementation of blockchain technology in the application of the remanufacturing sector. A framework has been proposed and validated in a Danish automotive parts remanufacturing company. Multi-criteria decision-making method has been used to identify the effective and most influential barriers among common barriers. Results reveal that “scaling of technology” (B6) is the key barrier of BCT implementation in remanufacturing context. This study concludes with useful discussions based on the results along with the recommendations to eradicate those influential barriers and their respective impacts on SDGs (SDG4, SDG8, SDG9, and SDG17). Finally, this study sheds light on future enhancements on the integration of blockchain technology in remanufacturing to reap several benefits of circular manufacturing. © 2022 The Author.

Design/methodology/approach: The information processing perspective presented by Jay Galbraith (Galbraith, 1974) can be an appropriate platform to analyze organizational requirements, also in new complex and uncertain situation. The authors use the Miles and Snow (1978) typology to explain how traditional design can be appropriate in the new world of sustainability and digitalization. Findings: With the new types of business models, the design should have a holistic view. The design should be split into three levels: the corporation as a whole, the large business units and the operating units. Each of these units can follow traditional organizational forms with an internal market-based coordination combined with digital platform systems. Originality/value: Both large and small corporations now face big challenges related to adapting their business models, managerial processes and organizational structures for digitalization and sustainability. Digitalization and sustainability combine the various pieces of the corporation into a tightly coupled network with a real time coordination of activities making it difficult to obtain local adjustments without disturbing the whole. At the same time, there is a strong need for both being locally agile with a focus on effectiveness and at the same time being very efficient. The literature calls for new organizational forms to handle this situation. The authors show that “old” designs properly coordinated can be an appropriate design as well. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Digitalization; Large corporations; Organizational design",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127365856

Achieving the SDGs is constrained by limited resources that require frugal solutions that are affordable, easy-to-use, ecologically sustainable, and socially inclusive. The role of infrastructure companies developing technologies with a frugal orientation that focus on the 17 SDGs must be at the core of efforts, because sustainable infrastructure is critical to the SGDs. This paper examines how such company-efforts foster the SDGs through the lens of frugal innovation. An exploratory multiple case study methodology was used with a 3-step and 4-dimensional evaluation approach to determine what technologies are fostering the SDGs, and their frugal characteristics. The results show that alternative resource and energy innovations are at the core of how infrastructure companies are promoting sustainability and fostering the SDGs. Most cases cluster around ecological contributions (mainly climate and energy), with sustainability and cost-effectiveness being the common characteristics. Implications for theory and practice are discussed, as well implications for policy-making.

Our main contribution is the proposal and illustration of a Venn-diagram approach as a simple-to-implement, yet insightful methodology to visualize findings from free association questions. This approach helps brand management understand and compare the associations attached to a brand by multiple stakeholders and their degree of match with management-desired brand associations. We illustrate the managerial relevance of this approach with results from an international study comparing brand associations desired by the management of a company with brand associations elicited by customers and employees, with some 1500 respondents respectively. For the particular case investigated, we find that management-desired associations may not (yet) be top-of-mind for customers, employees or both groups, while these groups hold (and partly share) associations not desired by the organization.

Indeed, our analysis of the reflexivity literature reveals four significant points of contestation – the subject/object distinction, temporality, representation and agency – all of which revolve around the interplay of an ‘I’ (at least one reflexive agent) and an ‘it’ (something to be reflexive about). The focus of this inquiry lies in how the ‘I’ and the ‘it’ are constituted communicatively and what generates, sustains and animates them in interaction. Such interactions are sourced from a post-experience master programme for practising managers, thus providing naturally occurring data amendable to a ventriloquial analysis. We identify and demonstrate three types of reflexive moments: conflating, bifurcating and animating. We subsequently theorize these as instances of ventriloquial reflexivity, using the terms conflating, bifurcating and animating to express the different moments in which speakers co-orient to the communicative constitution of the ‘I’ and the ‘it’. Ventriloquial reflexivity allows us to explore reflexivity as an interactional and situated accomplishment, thus further pointing to how reflexive practices can be understood and enhanced. © The Author(s) 2022.","CCO; communicative constitution of organizations; reflexivity; ventriloquial reflexivity; ventriloquism",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127339191

In both settings, joint audits appeared in the 1930s to increase auditors’ competence and independence. After a few decades of practice, joint audits became taken for granted, but in the 1980s, conglomerated audit networks attempted to circumvent the joint audit rule, entering into conflict with local auditors. In France, the main association of auditors adopted successive regulatory measures that prevented circumventing the model, therefore avoiding its erosion. Such regulatory layering crucially reshaped the model to sustain belief in its potential whenever a particular form of joint audit failed. In Denmark, the local audit firms essentially resisted attacks against the model rhetorically, which was insufficient to prevent its erosion in the 1990s and its suppression by the law in 2005. Contrasting the two cases shows the multi-modal ways in which actors undertake institutional work and it provides timely information for regulators engaged in discussions about joint audits. © 2022 European Accounting Association.","Erosion; Institutional Work; Mandatory Joint Audit; Regulatory Layering",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127310577

The relational view and resource dependence theory predict how supplier-specific investments and supplier dependence make the supplier more willing to allocate its best resources to the focal buyer relative to other buyers. However, these theories are ambiguous regarding the interplay between these two constructs. Specifically, the combination could either create relational synergies that benefit the focal buyer or create a situation in which the supplier reconsiders its resource allocation decisions and potentially allocates its resources to the accounts of other buyers. We investigated these competing views by building on two independent dyadic datasets. We found positive effects for both a buyer's supplier-specific investments and supplier dependence on supplier resource allocation, which is measured as the supplier's allocation of physical and innovation resources to the focal buyer relative to competing buyers. However, we also found evidence that supplier dependence negatively moderates the effect of supplier-specific investments on supplier resource allocation. Hence, the effect of supplier-specific investments weakens when the supplier is dependent on the buyer's business volume. These findings make an important empirical contribution to the literature by clarifying the dual workings of supplier-specific investments and supplier dependence as mechanisms to influence supplier resource allocation.

Business potentials are demonstrated mainly from the marketing perspective on servitization. However, increased digitalisation makes servitization interesting to other research areas. This paper applies the resource-based view (RBV) to argue how to value the data and explore its potential and impact on servitization. We examine the evolving role of information technology (IT), particularly of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the role of data in the servitization journey. This research is based on a longitudinal study of a product-oriented manufacturing company’s transformation towards servitization. The engagement with the company also includes the development of an IT platform that consolidates IoT and enterprise data, which enables managers to explore new data-based insights. Our goal is to investigate the organisation and in particular cross-functional effects of data-based insights and their impact on supporting strategic decision-making. The action design research (ADR) approach is applied to unfold the servitizing activities inside the organisation and extract the lesson learned into the joint domains of servitization and information systems research. First, we argued that exploring the value of data is becoming a more complex process. Rather than having one design perspective, technical concerns, business considerations, and operational purpose must be aligned to frame the value of data to support decision-making. Second, we discuss the emerging managerial implications, especially the role of IT in the transformation. A cross-functional team is a prerequisite to exploring complex transformation projects. Thus, managers must recognise the problematic situation and bootstrap the available organisational resources. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on how scholars and practitioners can address mutual interests by applying the ADR approach to a transformation project. In summary, servitizing a product-centric manufacturing firm to have a digital services business model is a transformation involving complex social and organisational relations. This study advocates resource-based analysis as a lens and demonstrates how IT and data as heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile resources create value for a product-oriented manufacturing company. However, a critical question remains on how to manage the expanding operational condition of a servitizing organisation and its business system to sustain its competitive advantage and win the digital market. © The Operational Research Society 2022.","action design research (ADR); business system; digital servitization; digital transformation; Internet of Things (IoT); resource-based view (RBV)","Commerce; Competition; Decision making; Industrial research; Information services; Managers; Manufacture; Metadata; Action design research; Business systems; Design research; Digital servitization; Digital transformation; Internet of thing; Research approach; Resource-based view; Servitization; Internet of things",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127212657

First, to combine a holistic model – in our case the balanced scorecard – with the time-driven activity-based costing model. The inspiration for this stems both from Kaplan and Norton and from the intense discussions and use of business analytics (BA) and performance management (PM). Second, to use numerical experiments – more specifically Monte Carlo simulation – to design and explore four hypothetical scenarios within such a holistic model. The paper also aims to emphasise the role played by statistics in increasing the confidence in using such a framework. Design/methodology/approach: The author runs four numerical experiments using different assumptions to show how a decision-maker can improve the outcome by making small changes in the key performance indicator (KPI) input variables. Findings: The paper gives recommendations for the assumptions that each decision-maker has to consider when setting out to conduct this kind of analysis. Small changes in some input variables may completely change the output and hence the decision result. Practical implications: The paper shows why practitioners and researchers need to better understand the limitations of deterministic analysis to make realistic models when combining more accounting models. To choose the relevant probability distributions for the input resources is an important issue for the decision-maker as they have a very large impact on the result. Originality/value: The real value of the paper lies in making students and practitioners as well as researchers aware of the opportunities for stochastic modelling and also to point at the problems and limitations of combining elements from BA with performance measurement and management. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Balanced scorecard; Business analytics; Decision-making; Management accounting; Optimisation; Performance; Simulation; Time-driven ABC",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126814821

Based on a real-time, in-depth study of the micro-dynamics of realizing an abstract mission into everyday practice, this study argues that key events designed by the management team serve as offerings for employees to enter a reflexive space, thereby creating a ‘window of translation’.

This study suggests that innovation processes can benefit from offering various opportunities for reflection and active engagement with the translation of an abstract idea into concrete practice.

However, they do so asynchronously, which means that continuous management attention and repeated events for reflection, experimentation and discussion are needed to get everyone on board. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","frontlines; mission innovation; public innovation; public service organizations; Scandinavian institutionalism; Translation theory",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126663319

We theorize, in this paper, that the effectiveness of lead firms’ GVC governance strategies for social sustainability—which can be audit-based or cooperation-based—depends on the local institutional context of the supplier. Supplier country institutions exert legal and civil society pressures for social sustainability, which shape suppliers’ attitude and receptiveness towards lead firm requests. Using unique primary data from 356 garment and footwear suppliers in 11 emerging countries, which supply to Western European or North American buyers, we show that GVC governance strategies are particularly effective for suppliers’ social sustainability implementation when there is ‘contextual fit’ with local institutional pressures for social sustainability in the supplier country. Our study identifies the boundary conditions of GVC governance modes, and demonstrates a complementary relationship between organizational arrangements and their institutional-level counterparts in the context of social sustainability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Global value chain; GVC governance strategy; Social sustainability; Supplier country institutions",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126372575

These arguments are important as democracies thrive when business employs its power in a responsible manner. When corporations lobby alone, it can be a challenge to do so as they tend to overlook long-term interests of the broader business community and society. The arguments are tested for the first time in a corporatist context through an original survey experiment among corporate lobbyists in Germany and the Netherlands. The study finds support for the expectation on conflict, which is striking as it indicates that corporations prefer to lobby alone due to conflict even in contexts in which they are not incentivized to do so. © 2022 The Author.

Since urban tourism is often associated with crowding and multiple shorter trips, it is especially vulnerable to health risks and is thus logically less attractive than more social-distance-friendly rural or coastal tourism. In addition, will the crisis probably have long-term effects on urban travel demand, travel supply and urban tourism policies. Therefore, the pandemic questions some of our basic assumptions, theories and our existing tourism research as such. Obviously, not all of our knowledge and foci will become obsolete, but this chapter questions some of our assumptions and discusses the evolving realities of the urban landscape in this regard.

Four studies support our proposition and demonstrate that consumers with high instrumental need-for-touch are more confident in their choices, less likely to see risks associated with their choices, and they are more likely to make (vs. defer) purchase decisions when using touchscreens.

Through grouping, maintenance interval (MI)-based evaluation and performance assessment, potential nonvalue-adding maintenance elements can be identified in the current maintenance structure. The framework reduces management complexity and supports the decision-making process for further maintenance improvement. Design/methodology/approach: The evaluation framework follows a prescriptive research approach. The framework is structured in three steps, which are further illustrated in the case study. The case study utilizes real-life data to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework. Findings: Through a case study conducted on 9,538 pieces of equipment from eight offshore oil and gas production platforms, the results show considerable potential for maintenance performance improvement, including up to a 23% reduction in periodic maintenance hours. Research limitations/implications: The problem of performance evaluation under limited data availability has barely been addressed in the literature on the plant level. The proposed framework aims to provide a quantitative approach to reducing the structural complexity of the periodic maintenance evaluation process and can help maintenance professionals prioritize the focus on maintenance improvement among current strategies. Originality/value: The proposed framework is especially suitable for initial performance assessment in systems with a complex structure, limited maintenance records and imperfect data, as it reduces management complexity and supports the decision-making process for further maintenance improvement.

Furthermore, the aim is to direct future management research by identifying what is still undiscovered regarding areas such as leadership concepts, measurements of absenteeism, methodology and country-specific contexts of the studies. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative review which is suitable as the literature on leadership and employee absenteeism is still emergent and characterized by heterogeneity in terms of operationalization of absenteeism and leadership concepts, respectively, as well as types of analyses. Findings: This review identifies different aspects of leadership affecting employee absence, i.e. leadership behaviours (i.e. task, relational, change, passive), leadership styles, leaders' social modelling and attitudes, and leaders' management of health and absence. Furthermore, a number of gaps in extant research are identified as well as a research agenda is provided.

We randomly assign the role of leaders or workers to subjects, who can choose to report an outcome via automatic or self-reporting. Self-reporting allows for profitable and undetectable earnings manipulation. We vary the leaders’ ability to choose the reporting method and to punish workers. We show that workers are more likely to choose automatic reporting when their leader voluntarily does so and can assign punishment. Even workers who choose self-reporting tend to cheat less when their leader chooses automatic reporting. Nonetheless, most leaders do not opt for automatic reporting in the first place: they often choose self-reporting and punish workers who rather choose automatic reporting. Collectively, our results reveal a dual effect of leadership on ethical behaviors in organizations: workers behave more ethically if their leader makes ethical choices, but often leaders do not make ethical choices in the first place.

The purpose of this paper is to identify, discuss and provide suggestions for how ML could be included in research and education in the future for the management accountant. Design/methodology/approach: This paper identifies three types of studies on the influence of ML on MA issued between 2015 and 2021 in mainstream accounting journals, by professional accounting bodies and by large consulting companies. Findings: First, only very few academic articles actually show examples of using ML or using different algorithms related to MA issues. This is in contrast to other research fields such as finance and logistics.

The firm’s stock of knowledge capital is measured by intangible capital that is calculated from organisational, product development and ICT investments. The employees’ knowledge stock is approximated by their completed educational degrees. Our data originate from Danish registers and covers 2000–2016.

The present paper aims to provide an overview of these redesigns and their rationales from the companies' point of view and theoretically reflect on their organisational value. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis is based on a review of articles from journals, professional magazines and the business press that describe how nine high-profile companies from the debate changed their PMSP design. Findings: The PMSP redesigns are directed towards what in the literature has been referred to as people PMSPs. The authors identify five organisational challenges to which the people PMSPs are exposed and specify the design elements that the companies have changed to meet these challenges. Finally, the authors outline a set of theoretical propositions that demonstrate some of the trade-offs involved with the redesigns. Originality/value: The paper contributes to researchers and practitioners by providing more insight into why and how companies have redesigned their people PMSPs. Answers to these questions are vital in understanding the trends and redesigns that practitioners are currently considering. Furthermore, since the empirical research of the effects of these redesigns is still limited, we outline a set of theory-based propositions helpful for future empirical investigations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Human resource management; Organisational change; Performance appraisal; Performance management",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125961166

Several factors are directly or indirectly responsible for adopting drone delivery, such as customer expectations, delivery urgency and flexibility to name a few. As the traditional mode of delivery has some potential drawbacks to deliver medical supplies in both rural and urban settings, unmanned aerial vehicles can be considered as an alternative to overcome the difficulties. For this reason, drones are incorporated in the healthcare supply chain to transport lifesaving essential medicine or blood within a very short time. However, since there are numerous types of drones with varying characteristics such as flight distance, payload-carrying capacity, battery power, etc., selecting an optimal drone for a particular scenario becomes a major challenge for the decision-makers. To fill this void, a decision support model has been developed to select an optimal drone for two specific scenarios related to medical supplies delivery. Design/methodology/approach: The authors proposed a methodology that incorporates graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA) to select an optimal drone for two specific scenarios related to medical supplies delivery at (1) urban areas and (2) rural/remote areas based on a set of criteria and sub-criteria critical for successful drone implementation. Findings: The findings of this study indicate that drones equipped with payload handling capacity and package handling flexibility get more preference in urban region scenarios. In contrast, drones with longer flight distances are prioritized most often for disaster case scenarios where the road communication system is either destroyed or inaccessible. Research limitations/implications: The methodology formulated in this paper has implications in both academic and industrial settings. This study addresses critical gaps in the existing literature by formulating a mathematical model to find the most suitable drone for a specific scenario based on its criteria and sub-criteria rather than considering a fleet of drones is always at one's disposal. Practical implications: This research will serve as a guideline for the practitioners to select the optimal drone in different scenarios related to medical supplies delivery. Social implications: The proposed methodology incorporates GTMA to assist decision-makers in order to appropriately choose a particular drone based on its characteristics crucial for that scenario. Originality/value: This research will serve as a guideline for the practitioners to select the optimal drone in different scenarios related to medical supplies delivery. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","COVID-19; Disruptions; Drone selection; Graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA); Medicals supplies; Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125960675

Based on a three group, between-subjects experiment of 122 Swedish university students studying agricultural and rural management, we tested whether the advice our participants gave to a fictitious farmer to pursue entrepreneurial activity depended on information regarding the farmer's motivation to pursue entrepreneurship (experimental treatments included motivation scenarios based on necessity vs. opportunity driven vs. control). Moreover, we test whether entrepreneurial advice is moderated by the participants own “Jante-ness”. Unexpectedly, we found that our participants did not adapt the entrepreneurship advice they give to the situational context, nor does Jante play a moderating role; instead we found that Jante had a significant and negative main effect on the entrepreneurial advice given. This finding suggests that Jante is still very much alive and may play an important role in explaining relatively low rates of innovation and entrepreneurship in (Swedish) agriculture. © The Author(s) 2022.","Agriculture; Context; Entrepreneurship; Jante; Motivation; Tall Poppy Syndrome",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125920546

A qualitative method of data analysis was used, using interviews with Portuguese migrants in Colombia and other secondary materials. The results suggest that the main motivations for the exit of Portuguese from their country relate to the lack of opportunities and low quality of life, mainly at the financial level.

By drawing on institutional theory and various empirical data collected through ethnographical field studies, this article offers a qualitative analysis about how the national, socio-cultural context and the sport governance system have coloured the institutionalisation of parkour in Denmark. The institutionalisation has been driven by the practitioners’ interest in getting access to sport facilities and therefore a need to accommodate the sport governance system. But also, at the same time, by the existing associations who are facing challenges to attract young people and therefore integrating parkour into their schedules.

The presented sustainable purchasing and supply management (SPSM) competence model is based on the combination of a systematic literature review (SLR) and a Delphi study. The competence model outlines specific SPSM competences which are divided into functional-oriented, cognition-oriented, social-oriented and meta-oriented competence clusters. We also discuss their applicability during typical purchasing and supply management processes. Each of the 26 competences is presented with a short definition as well as exemplary behaviors. For research on SPSM from an organizational point of view, the analysis of the relevance of competences with regard to purchasing process stages offers a conceptual basis for bringing sustainability into overall PSM models, instead of positioning sustainability as an ‘add-on’ activity, which risks the potential of sustainability issues becoming marginalized. The resulting SPSM competence model can serve as a basis for improving teaching and training in both higher education and professional training contexts. In practice, it can also serve to aid the selection of new employees, evaluate employee performance, create development plans or build HR systems. © 2022, The Author(s).","Competences; Purchasing and supply management; Sustainability",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125731265

It discusses whether, for relatively peripheral places that experience socio-economic problems, designation as global geopark may constitute a platform for addressing such issues by working with place-bound resources to achieve viable place-based development. In addition, it suggests that geopark status may allow for a more inclusive and participatory place branding process that relies on co-creating the place brand with multiple local stakeholders rather than on imposition of a place brand top-down. Given that the Global Geoparks Network (GGN) offers ‘a landscape approach for geological heritage conservation, research and sustainable development’ and relies on bottom-up local involvement, allocation of geopark status arguably creates opportunities to develop an overarching narrative and place stories that can be levered to foster pride of place and promote geotourism. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Geotourism; Inclusive place branding; Place narrative; Place-based development; UNESCO Global Geopark Odsherred",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125542001

Some recent studies move to the system level by assessing how the structure of actor-based knowledge networks is affected by such policies. We continue in that direction and analyze how technology-based regional knowledge spaces are shaped by the introduction of a cluster policy. Taking the example of the German BioRegio contest, we examine how such knowledge spaces in winning and non-winning regions evolved before, during and after the policy. Using a difference-in-differences approach, we identify treatment effects of increased knowledge space embeddedness of biotechnology only in the post-treatment period.

Profit margins are seen to vary greatly from project to project, which may partly be explained by a lack of references to guide design decisions. Specifically, new product offerings are often based on reuse of design knowledge, which is often not efficiently utilised, as the knowledge transfer and reuse across projects are unstructured, incomplete, or not providing a suitable reference for design specification. To address this issue, this paper presents a method for identifying reference architectures under the consideration of profitability. The method was developed by combining and extending known methods within the fields of product architecture and complexity cost estimation to cover part of the ETO domain. The method was tested in two companies, one producing industrial spray drying plants and the other providing solutions for the production of confectionary products. The findings suggest that a limited understanding of ‘preferred solutions' existed in the two case companies, and applying the suggested method to identifying reference architectures could potentially support a more profitable project execution. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","complexity cost; cost analysis; Engineer to order; Product design; reference architecture",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125333317

However, less attention has been given to how an emerging technology disrupts the meaning and moral values that tether people to their work and render it meaningful. To understand how workers respond to such an emerging technology, we undertook an inductive, qualitative study of military personnel working in unmanned aerial vehicles, or drone operations, for the U.S. Air Force. We draw on multiple data sources, including personal diaries kept by personnel involved in drone operations. We identified three characteristics of drone technology: remote-split operations, remote piloting of unmanned vehicles, and interaction through iconic representations. Our analysis suggests that drone technology has revolutionized warfare by (1) creating distanciated intimacy, (2) dissolving traditional spatio-temporal boundaries between work and personal life, and (3) redefining the legal and moral parameters of work. Drone program workers identified with these changes to their working environment in contradictory ways, which evoked emotional ambivalence about right and wrong. However, their organization gave them little help in alleviating their conflicting feelings. We illuminate how workers cope with such ambivalence when a technology transforms the meaning and morality of their work. We extend theory by showing that workers' responses to a changed working environment as a result of a remote technology are not just based on how the technology changes workers' tasks, roles, and status but also on how it affects their moral values. © 2021 INFORMS","Drones; Emerging technology; Emotional ambivalence; Emotions; Military; Moral emotions; Remote control; War",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125247073

I found that the programme promoted images and worldviews of an ideal and desired professional identity, which did not match the role transitions and expectations to be enacted by the participants. In addition, the findings show how cultural and organizational dynamics constrained processes of identity reconstruction in the learning context. Implications of the study (e.g. how to theorize and learn from attempts to match people with new role expectations and environmental demands) are discussed. By building bridges across socialization theory, identity work and research on identities in context, and hereby integrating micro- and macro perspectives on professional identity reconstruction, existing theory is elaborated. The article concludes by pointing to the analytical value of exploring how professionals in later stages of their careers struggle to adopt timely and relevant identities and how we better understand the challenges stemming from this identity reconstruction work. © The Author(s) 2022.","Identity; identity work; professional identity reconstruction; professionals",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125240816

The research design of this paper is to conduct a systematic literature review by including 41 papers as an initial set of studies for review; we screen the papers and implement inclusion and quality checks on these studies, and we qualify 15 papers for the final review. The key findings of this paper, from the systematic literature review, list a set of success factors and challenges that enterprises should consider to strengthen or to avoid. We propose these factors in a form of proposed framework suggesting four categories: strategy, enterprise architecture, data, and trust. Because of the publication specification and limitation, we limited the scope of our primary studies to a limited set to match the constraints and limitations. The paper includes implications for the academic literature review and the extraction of factors that can impact the process of the enterprise artificial intelligence democratization, and the need to increase the awareness of the enterprise AI practices in order to overcome the challenges that might prevent enterprises from having a successful enterprise AI. While there are some efforts to assess and review the success factors and challenges of the AI practices in general, one of the major findings of the literature review conducted is that there is evident research gap in the literature on the perception and associated factors of artificial intelligence.

However, virtual reality (VR) tourism offered people a way to escape the isolation. Media reports and research have noted heightened activity in VR tourism, which has been touted as “alternative tourism” and “eco-tourism”. However, scholars have yet to determine whether this shift is temporary or will persist after the pandemic is over. Questions also remain regarding the factors driving this behaviour. The present study uses stimulus-organism-response theory (SOR) to propose a sequential mechanism of the interplay of antecedents and outcomes, theorising VR tourism as a sustainable tourism solution long into the future. The model, tested by analysing 359 responses collected from VR users through Prolific Academic, confirmed the positive association of the environmental impact of touristic travel and pandemic travel anxiety with eco-guilt; pandemic travel anxiety, moreover, was also associated with attitude towards VR tourism. Furthermore, attitude towards VR tourism was positively associated with willingness to forgo the pleasure of in-situ tourism and post-pandemic VR tourism continuance intentions, with willingness also mediating the association between the other two. Finally, willingness partially mediated the association of attitude and fully mediated the association of eco-guilt with intentions. © 2022 The Author(s).

Underlying reasons for these organic food preferences are explored in an emerging and a developed economy, China and Germany, employing a comparative mixed-methods approach consisting of in-store interviews, focus groups, and an online survey. Contrary to prior research, we find a domestic country bias for organic foods in China, but smaller than in Germany, and Chinese consumers trust the organic standards of developed countries more than their own. Chinese consumers’ primary reasons for preferring organic foods are food quality and safety concerns. German consumers prefer domestic products and imports from geographically close countries and environmental concerns are the primary reasons for this and for preferring organic foods. Results suggest that higher consumer trust in institutions in developed (“WEIRD”) countries is a competitive advantage for producers in these countries, not only on the domestic market, but also in the world market for organic food. © The Author(s) 2022.","China; consumer preferences; country-of-origin; emerging economy; Germany; imported organic food; trust",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125095731

We use the unique case of Finland as a quasi-experiment to examine the relation between the type of nomination procedure and board turnover. We find that firms with SNBs have boards with shorter average tenure, and fewer long-serving directors. We also find evidence suggesting a higher turnover performance sensitivity in the case of SNB firms: the average board tenure is more strongly related to firm performance in the case of SNB firms, and the relation between board tenure and the presence of experienced directors is more related to performance in SNB firms. In all, our results support the claim that SNBs might be useful tools to turn around board structures and tie individual director´s performance to company performance. © 2022 Asociación Española de Contabilidad y Administración de Empresas (AECA).","Board of directors; board turnover; G32; G34; G38; M48; nomination committees; Nordic corporate governance",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124767165

For instance, we need a richer, more complete vocabulary to describe interdependence and regulatory mechanisms that managers can use to design and intervene in networks of interdependent processes.

Following prior work on using chess as a controlled setting for studying competitive interactions, we compare the same players’ capabilities and performance across conventional, centaur, and engine chess tournaments. Our analysis shows that AI adoption triggers interrelated substitution and complementation dynamics, which make humans’ traditional competitive capabilities obsolete, while creating new sources of persistent heterogeneity when humans interact with chess engines. These novel human-machine capabilities are unrelated, or even negatively related, to traditional capabilities. We contribute an integrated view of substitution and complementation, which identifies AI as the driver of these dynamics and explains how they jointly shift the sources of competitive advantage. Managerial Summary: AI-based technologies increasingly substitute and complement humans in managerial tasks such as decision making. We investigate how such change affects the sources of competitive advantage. AI-based engines’ adoption in chess allows us to investigate competitive capabilities and performance in human, AI, and hybrid settings. We find that neither humans nor AI in isolation explain performance differences in the AI and hybrid settings. Instead, a new decision-making resource emerges at the human-AI intersection, which drives performance but is unrelated or even negatively related to humans’ original capability. Our results document how AI adoption changes the sources of competitive advantage and, in turn, requires managers to develop new capabilities to stay relevant in an AI-based competitive landscape. © 2022 The Authors.

These marketing instruments can not only impact sales, but also product returns. However, when assessing the performance of marketing instruments, retailers often ignore potential return effects. Theoretically, marketing instruments could increase or decrease returns, depending on how they affect expected and experienced costs and benefits related to a product. In this paper, we empirically examine whether, and how a comprehensive set of marketing instruments (newsletters, catalogs, coupons, free shipping, paid search, affiliate advertising and image advertising) affects product returns. We use data from two major online retailers and show that return effects vary largely across marketing instruments. Surprisingly, none of the instruments reduces product returns. Newsletters, paid search, catalogs and free shipping increase returns substantially by up to 18%. For free shipping and catalogs, the return effects emerge prevalently for fashion categories, whereas online advertising and newsletters increase returns of both fashion and non-fashion products. These findings enhance our understanding of how firm-initiated marketing instruments affect returns and provide guidance for online retailers in multimedia environments. © 2022 New York University","Marketing instruments; Online retailing; Product returns; Return management",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124385595

Based on these insights, the paper reflects on the lessons that are learned for the future of short-term rentals. Design/methodology/approach: This is a qualitative multi-method small-scale case study, which relies on in-depth interviews and a focus group discussion carried out with a group of hosts affiliated to the Airbnb Host Community in Aarhus, Denmark. Informed by an interpretivist approach, the study aims to make sense of people's subjective experiences with hosting on the Airbnb platform, and how they have continued and adapted their hospitality practices during the pandemic. Findings: Participants' adaptive practices vary according to their motivations to host and the type of accommodation that they rent out. Although all hosts in this study now implement more intensive cleaning practices, hosts who stay with their guests onsite tend to take stricter preventative measures to avoid contamination and transmission of the virus in their social interactions with guests. On the contrary, hosts who rent out their entire properties and have minimal contact with their guests found themselves less affected by the pandemic's impacts and have had a continued demand for their properties. Social implications: The COVID-19 pandemic has unevenly affected Airbnb hosts. Hosts who share their homes with guests require different adaptations to their daily behaviour and cleaning practices at home than hosts who do not stay with their guests and rent out entire properties. However, unlike professional hosts who largely or solely rely on Airbnb for their income, occasional home-sharing hosts tend to be more flexible in coping with cancelled or fewer bookings. Originality/value: This study provides novel insights into the uneven impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on participants in the platform economies of tourism. It contributes to existing literature on the impacts of the pandemic on Airbnb's operations by showing how hosts' adaptive practices are informed by their subjective living conditions and the type of accommodation they can offer their guests. © 2022, Simon Lind Fischer and Maartje Roelofsen.","Airbnb; COVID-19 pandemic; Denmark; Host motivations; Inequalities",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124373417

The analysis focuses on similarities and deviations of BM configurations among 80 companies operating in the industry sector related to Phantom Limb Pain (PLP). Leveraging a questionnaire-based mapping tool, the results show that companies operating within the area of PLP treatment apply relatively similar BM configurations. This indicates that companies mostly imitate the successful BMs of their main competitors in the industry as a whole and in their specific sub-groups, thus potentially ignoring the opportunity to also compete on a BM level. The contribution brought by the paper is twofold. First, it adds to the research stream on BM configurations by showing that this concept can be used not only to analyze and foster cross-industry BM imitation, but also to explore and examine intra-industry BM imitation (or differentiation). Second, the article contributes to the research stream on intra-industry BM imitation by going beyond prior anecdotal evidence and empirically testing the existence of the phenomenon of intra-industry BM imitation and hence, the potential innovation space on a BM level. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","business model configurations; Business model imitation; business model innovation; value drivers",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124314684

Design/methodology/approach: The authors undertake a conceptual analysis and present an enhanced framework of absorptive capacity by integrating multiple literature streams. The authors have analysed the most relevant literature to provide underlying justifications for the proposed conceptual model. Findings: Absorptive capacity ensures the long-term survival and success of a business. To develop absorptive capacity successfully, firms should focus on its various dimensions and existing intangible assets and external environment. The multidimensionality and richness of absorptive capacity is an under-explored area in the existing literature. The authors revisit the conceptualisation of absorptive capacity and add environmental conditions and the internationalisation process to the original conceptualisation. Absorptive capacity does not lead to a competitive advantage independent of its environment. To successfully develop it, firms have to adopt a holistic approach by considering the multi-dimensions, drivers and contextual conditions of absorptive capacity. Originality/value: This study contributes by conceptualising absorptive capacity as a dynamic capability. It is one of the first studies to specifically propose a framework that combines antecedents (prior knowledge, combinative capabilities and IT capabilities), moderators (environmental conditions, namely, market and technological turbulence, competitiveness and the internationalisation process) and consequences (competitive advantage). The study offers a unique conceptualisation with implications for researchers and managers.

By recognising the importance of both the macro-trends and the idiosyncrasies of the micro context, it provides a holistic perspective on the continuous adaptions of IR as it travels, thereby contributing to our understanding of the diversity inherent in IR practice. Second, it provides empirical insights into the challenges of adapting IR in a public sector context. Third, it reveals the idea carrier's instrumental role in connecting different contexts and in editing and giving meaning to the continuous translations of IR. Highlights Illustrates the emergence of a “new” reporting idea, namely integrated reporting from the global corporate reporting context into a local public sector context. Analytical focus on the process of translating IR and the continuous transformation as it travels across contexts. Brings out the role of individual idea carriers in the preadoption phase of IR, highlighting the relational and rhetorical work involved in the travel of ideas across contexts. Reveals the fragility of the idea as the meaning structures embodied in the translation do not support integrated thinking. © 2022 The Author(s).

When these structures become too rigid, revolutionary moments that punctuate the status quo are required for the structures to accommodate to a new situation. Approaching sociotechnical change with “punctuation of equilibrium” is becoming increasingly ineffective. In line with rising instability and rapid digital development, we argue that new sociotechnical change approaches are needed. In this paper we investigate how individual knowledge workers respond to the increasingly complex challenges they face when orchestrating social and technical structures to support efficient and creative knowledge work. We suggest a new perspective that covers an unstable equilibrium emerging from the interplay between individuals and their usage of “the collection of rigid and flexible workplace technologies”. Our study is based on data from interviews made with 40 knowledge professionals over a period of three years, inquiring into individual experiences with sociotechnical change. Our study reveals contradictory patterns of both technological-individualisation and -socialisation. A universal generative mechanism emerges when these patterns complement each other and generates continuous change that seems to diminish inertia from rigid structures while also intensifying agile responses. © Operational Research Society 2022.","critical realism; deep and surface structures; generative mechanisms; Sociotechnical change; unstable equilibrium","Information use; Rigid structures; A-stable; Critical realisms; Deep and surface structure; Generative mechanism; Knowledge workers; Social structure; Socio-technical changes; Status quo; Technical structures; Unstable equilibriums; Information systems",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124105547

This qualitative case study on the textile industry in Portugal illustrates how SMEs are influenced by their IBA. Findings suggest that it has a preponderant role in supporting the international expansion of associated SMEs. Particularly, the promotion and organisation of trade fairs seem to foster first entries and continuous international expansion in the same way the IBA seems to influence their foreign market selection. However, SMEs feel that the IBA’s work could still be improved by their facilitating more matchmaking processes, promoting collaborations, improving their seizing of available internationalisation opportunities, and providing more information about agents and distributors in foreign markets. Thus, we can say that, despite the internet and global opportunities that firms can directly benefit from, the role of IBAs is still relevant for SME’s internationalisation, and there is still room for improvement.

In trying to find answers to this question, we take our lead from recent debates about People Analytics and analyze how the use of algorithmically driven digital technologies like facial recognition and drones in work-organizations and societies at large shape the conditions of ethical conduct. Linking the concepts of algorithmic governmentality and space of ethics, we analyze how such technologies come to form part of governing practices in specific contexts. We conclude that datafication and automation have huge implications for human reflexivity and the capacity to enact responsibility in decision making. But that itself does not mean that the space for ethical conduct disappears, which is the impression left in some literatures, but rather that is modified and (re) constituted in the interplay of mechanisms of closure (like automating decision making, black boxing and circumventing reflexivity), and opening (such as disclosing contingent values and interests in processes of problematization, contestation and resistance). We suggest that future research investigates in more detail the dynamics of closure and opening in empirical studies of the use and effects of algorithmically driven digital technologies in organizations and societies. © The Author(s) 2022.","algorithmic governmentality; drones; ethics; facial recognition; People Analytics","algorithm; article; automation; boxing; decision making; digital technology; empiricism; ethics; facial recognition; human; organization; responsibility",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85124087005

The research is conducted through a cross-disciplinary literature review on the origins of radical innovation and strategic innovation. Three propositions are developed from the literature review, which emphasise that horizontal leadership for innovative stability and change should be included in a model that provides novel insights and utilises the literature to enable strategic innovation. The model consists of the antecedent matrix of the two dualities of external business forces versus internal organisational forces and heterogeneous versus homogeneous resources that can be drawn upon in the organisation. In addition to this matrix, the dynamic organising process of creativity and control uses the mediators of connections, uncertainties, information flows, value propositions, human agencies, counter positions and preferred behaviours to enable strategic innovation. Practitioners can use the model in their own organisations to enhance horizontal leadership for value creation, and academia can use the model for further cross-disciplinary research and dissemination to enable strategic innovation.

However, the shortage of such digital human capital in many host countries is putting pressure on MNC subsidiaries to prevent these employees from leaving. We theorize that the retention of digital human capital in MNC subsidiaries does not merely depend on salaries but crucially on the learning opportunities that subsidiaries offer. By integrating mechanisms from the literature on subsidiary-specific advantages into theoretical models explaining voluntary mobility constraints of employees, we reason that the opportunities for acquiring new skills in subsidiaries with advanced digital expertise will reduce the odds of losing these valuable employees. We test our theoretical predictions for 11,598 employees with digital human capital working for 866 foreign MNC subsidiaries in Denmark observed between 2002 and 2012. We find that digital expertise helps retaining digital human capital. The effect is stronger if subsidiaries have an internationally diverse workforce and when they possess patented technologies. Both factors provide distinct learning opportunities from digital expertise. The effect is weaker if the subsidiary is located in regional clusters of digital expertise since alternative employers may offer similar learning opportunities. © 2022, Academy of International Business.","digital expertise; digitalization; human capital; retention; subsidiary-specific advantages",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123759599

In this study, we aim to test this assertion using a moderated mediation model applied on matched responses from 451 pairs of academic scientific employees. Results showed an overall positive association between job autonomy and work outcomes. However, this was moderated by the social context in the form of a trusting relationship towards the autonomy-granting supervisor.

This study shifts the focus from asking how to asking why individuals are so invested in pursuing a particular kind of WLB. Through analysing 62 life history interviews with male and female senior executives in Denmark, we develop the concept of the gendered project of the self to theorise WLB. We show how for the executives, WLB was not simply an instrumental process of time or role management; instead, pursuing WLB in a certain way was a key part of acquiring and maintaining a particular desired subjectivity or a sense of self as a better person, better worker and better parent. We argue that theorising WLB as the gendered project of the self allows us to explicate the mechanisms through which gendered social and cultural expectations translate into how male and female executives can and want to pursue their WLB goals – first by driving one’s desire for WLB and, second, by shaping and restricting what is desired. In doing so, we highlight the importance of scrutinising the role of broader WLB discourses in shaping the experience and uptake of organisational WLB policies. © The Author(s) 2022.","executives; gender; project of the self; subjectivity; top managers; work–family; work–life balance","adult; article; Denmark; expectation; female; gender; human; interview; life history; male; manager; sense of self; work-life balance; worker",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123462963

However, research in female football has focused on absolute values when reporting match demands, leading to sparse information being provided regarding the degrees of variability of such metrics. Thus, the aims of this study were to investigate the sources of variability of match physical performance parameters in female football players and to provide a framework for the interpretation of meaningful changes between matches. 54 female players from four top-level clubs were monitored during one season. GPS APEX (STATSports, Northern Ireland), with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz, were used in 60 official matches (n = 393) to determine the full-match and 1-min peak locomotor demands of total distance (TD), high-speed running distance (HSRD), sprint distance (SpD), accelerations and decelerations (Acc/Dec) and peak speed (Pspeed). For each variable, the between-team, between-match, between-position, between-player, and within-player variability was estimated using linear mixed-effect modelling. With exception to SpD (29.4 vs. 31.9%), all other metrics presented a higher observed match-to-match variability in the 1-min peaks than in the full-match (6.5 vs. 4.6%; 18.7% vs. 15.9%; 12.9 vs. 11.7%; for TD, HSRD and Acc/Dec, respectively). With the exception of SpD, higher changes in 1-min peaks than in full-match values are required to identify meaningful changes in each variable. Different sources of variability seem to impact differently the match physical performance of female football players. Furthermore, to identify meaningful changes, higher changes in 1-min peaks than in full-match values are required. © 2022 The Author(s).

This paper further unpacks this domain by examining the mechanisms that connect design-driven foresight with strategy articulation through relying on experiential learning. By drawing on a three-year research and innovation project, we illustrate how the relevant stakeholders make use of design-driven foresight processes while co-creating some interactive technologies needed to support crowdsourced curatorial processes in cultural heritage. The empirical evidence suggests how design-driven foresight, through co-creation workshops, can support experiential learning in the form of three distinct processes: favouring knowledge translation mechanisms, creating a safe space for learning-by-doing, and facilitating a multi-stakeholder conversation anchored to material and tangible work embedded in design artefacts. In turn, experiential learning can support processes of strategy articulation that emerge while stakeholders tinker with multiple exploitation pathways and progress through alternating phases of convergent and divergent thinking. Finally, it is argued that the plasticity and openness of design artefacts adopted in the context of foresight support forms of learning that will eventually foster processes of strategy articulation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Design; Experiential learning; Foresight; Strategy articulation","Co-creation; Cultural heritages; Design artifacts; Experiential learning; Foresight; Immersive; Innovation programs; Interactive technology; Knowledge translation; Strategy articulation; Design",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85123261636

In the model, long-range dependence and short memory dynamics are allowed in global and local common factors as well as model innovations. Estimation of global and local common factors is performed on the prewhitened series, for which the prewhitening parameter is estimated semiparametrically from the cross-sectional and local average of the observable series. Employing canonical correlation analysis and a sequential least-squares algorithm on the prewhitened series, the resulting multi-level factor estimates have centered asymptotic normal distributions under certain rate conditions depending on the bandwidth and cross-section size. Asymptotic results for common components are also established. The selection of the number of global and local factors is discussed. The methodology is shown to lead to good small-sample performance via Monte Carlo simulations. The method is then applied to the Nord Pool electricity market for the analysis of price comovements among different regions within the power grid. The global factor is identified to be the system price, and fractional cointegration relationships are found between local prices and the system price, motivating a long-run equilibrium relationship.

In doing so, the authors root benign masochism in the notion of play from evolutionary psychology and develop a benign masochism scale that is able to predict various tourism outcomes, including willingness to visit a haunted house, to go on a challenging adventure holiday, and to visit a nuclear disaster site.

The healthcare industry is one of the non-financial sectors that BT has significantly impacted. In this paper, for the first time, barriers to implement BT-based platforms from a balanced scorecard perspective in the healthcare sector are introduced, and these barriers are prioritized using a structural approach based on the weighted influence non-linear gauge system. Unlike other structural models such as decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), in this approach, both strength and influence intensity of components are considered in the ranking process. The proposed approach is applied in networks that have a hierarchical structure and intertwined components. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using the ranking of BT-based platform adoption barriers in the healthcare industry in Iran. The results show that financial issues, security issues, lack of expertise and knowledge, and uncertain government policies are the most important barriers to BT adoption in the healthcare industry. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adoption barriers; balanced scorecard; healthcare industry; Platforms based on blockchain technology; weighted influence non-linear gauge system","Decision making; Finance; Gages; Health care; Adoption barriers; Balanced scorecards; Block-chain; Financial sectors; Gauge systems; Healthcare industry; Platform based on blockchain technology; Structural approach; Technology-based; Weighted influence non-linear gauge system; Blockchain",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122879892

Our study advances scholarly understanding of social bricolage by examining resource mobilisation processes over time in the resource-scarce context of developing countries. Our analysis traces the six social bricolage constructs: making do, refusal to be constrained by limitations, improvisation, the creation of social value, stakeholder participation, and persuasion and community involvement. Our empirical data identifies three more constructs associated with social bricolage: distributed leadership/teamwork, dynamic capabilities, and legitimacy (trust and reputation). © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Egyptian social entrepreneurs; financial capital; human capital; legitimacy; resource mobilisation; social bricolage; social capital; social entrepreneurship",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122756752

These schemes have come to be considered as effective mechanisms to transform building markets and are seen to play a significant role in the mainstreaming of green building practices. In many countries, BEAMs are now used as policy instruments and are increasingly being mandated across a variety of public, but also private, sector projects. In this paper, we examine BEAMs as policy instruments and explore their potential to affect change in construction. Drawing on the theory of strategic action fields, and using the case of HK-BEAM, we discuss the origins, development and application of BEAMs and the limited impact that their mandate has on construction practice.

Thus, closed-loop manufacturing systems have to be designed and developed for disassembly, reprocessing of materials, re-assembly, and remanufacturing in a cost-efficient way. Compared to traditional manufacturing, this involves a higher need for changeability due to higher uncertainty, e.g. in terms of timing and quantity that the system needs to handle, uncertainty in quality and materials of received items, and in particular significant variety in returned items, the system should be designed to process. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to investigate how reconfigurability, as the enabler of changeability at manufacturing system level, can be utilised to aid challenges in closed-loop manufacturing systems for product take-back. Initially, insights from an industrial case are presented regarding challenges in establishing and operating closed-loop manufacturing systems for product take-back programs. Secondly, different closed-loop manufacturing concepts applying the principles of reconfigurability are proposed and evaluated in terms of cost and robustness towards the inherent uncertainties in supplied end-of-use items. The results show significant potential of utilising a modular and platform-based approach towards meeting supply uncertainties through reconfiguration, which allows for a more efficient setup for product take-back. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","changeability; closed-loop manufacturing; product take-back; reconfigurability; Remanufacturing; sustainability","Manufacture; Changeability; Circular economy; Closed-loop manufacturing; Cost-efficient; Product take-back; Re assemblies; Reconfigurability; Reconfigurable; Remanufacturing; Uncertainty; Sustainable development",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122407926

We detect conceptual ambiguity among scholars as a bottleneck that prevents advancements in the field of DBMI research. In this article, we aim to trace the foundation of key attributes of the DBMI concept and propose a novel definition. Our insights are based on a targeted, state-of-the-art literature review of 57 publications. We conclude with an exploration of avenues for future research, which we closely link to the broader fields of strategic management, information systems, and organization studies, thereby exposing the issue of DBMI to a wider audience.

To date, however, meat intake plays an important role in everyday food choices. With their ability to change the opinions of a critical mass, opinion leaders in food choices are assumed to play a predominant role in influencing future dietary styles. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify opinion leaders in food choices and their personal meat consumption behaviour as well as their attitude towards policy interventions aiming to meat reduction. Design/methodology/approach: The sample consisted of 1,479 German participants aged between 15 and 29 years who were online surveyed in autumn 2020. A latent profile analysis (LPA) identified three distinct groups of opinion leader in the younger generation labelled “non-opinion leaders”, “weak opinion leaders” and “opinion leaders”. The identified profiles were used to understand opinion leaders and their food choices by using chi-square tests as well as univariate ANOVA with Tukey or Games-Howell post hoc tests. Findings: Opinion leadership in food choices was associated with a higher interest in meat-reduced dietary styles and with more positive attitudes towards innovative food ideas. Moreover, opinion leaders were associated with politicised food decisions, indicating that their food choices align with their political and social interests. Originality/value: The results contribute to a better understanding of the development of future dietary styles, provide evidence for a shift towards more sustainable dietary patterns in the near future and highlight that food decisions are no longer solely decisions on an individual basis but rather becoming of political relevance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Latent profile analysis; Meat consumption; Opinion leadership; Politicised eater; Sustainability; Youth","adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; article; autumn; dietary pattern; female; German (citizen); human; human experiment; juvenile; leadership; major clinical study; male; meat consumption; post hoc analysis",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122152894

The purpose of this study is to integrate the three interrelated [knowledge management, risk management culture (RMC) and resilience] but often separately discussed concepts to advance the understanding of their intertwined influence on SCRes in the agri-food supply chains. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a cross-sectional survey approach where quantitative data is collected from 349 participants from the Australian agri-food supply chains to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: Exposure to supply chain risks triggers the deployment of specific knowledge management practices in the agri-food supply chains. Further, the analysis on serial mediation suggests that firms’ knowledge management practices work sequentially (knowledge acquisition, assimilation and application) and develop a RMC to achieve SCRes amid supply chain risks. Practical implications: The findings of this study inform practitioners and policymakers who seek to understand the key mechanisms that facilitate the development of SCRes when facing supply chain risks, particularly in the Australian agri-food supply chains. Social implications: The growth of the food industry through more resilient food supply chains could ensure sustained food supply and more employment opportunities. Originality/value: Using dynamic capability theory, the authors devise a novel empirical model that explicates how knowledge management practices and RMC instigate the dynamic capability of SCRes amid supply chain risks facing agri-food supply chains. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agri-food supply chains; Empirical; Knowledge management; Risk management culture; Supply chain resilience",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122099824

Analysis of findings reveal that unintended instances can become purposeful for both students and educators. We also highlight some of the strategies used by educators to capitalise on trouble, supporting reflection, adopting different personas, and in some cases intentionally creating “trouble”.

It develops an interpretive framework for episodic organizational change as a period of liminal transition that is triggered and driven by conflict. Emphasizing the liminal quality inherent in change processes, the social drama is used to generate a conceptual frame to investigate the opportunities and threats in liminal transitions, the various ways to re-establish social order in organizations and the associated role of leaders in liminal times. Promoting conflict’s productive nature for organizational change, the social drama is further used to provide a frame to investigate how social reality in organizations is challenged, developed, crafted, transformed and finally re-constituted through conflict. The article argues that the social drama perspective has the capacity to further reflexive thinking about change processes in organizations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.MAD statement: This article makes a difference as it promotes an understanding of episodes of change in organizations as liminal and conflictual transitions. It complements and challenges the well-known by emphasizing that change periods create liminal conditions that temporarily suspend established organizational structures. Highlighting the liminal condition of the organizational change requires a different understanding of how change is enacted and the role of leaders in the change process. Furthermore, conflict has a productive role in organizational change. It is a motor of change and a generative force for the dynamics of the change process and the reflexive headwork emerging between the opposing forces. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","conflict; episodic organizational change; liminality; social change; Social drama",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121478937

One reason is that business historians have not yet reconciled with the field's unique origins and intellectual tradition. This article develops a revisionist historiography of Chinese business history that retraces the field's development from its Cold War roots to the present day, showing how it has been shaped by the particular questions and concerns of area studies. It then goes on to explore five recent areas of novel inquiry, namely: The study of indigenous business institutions, business and semi-colonial context, business at the periphery of empire, business during socialist transition, and business under Chinese socialism. Through this mapping of past and present trajectories, the article aims to provide greater coherence to the burgeoning field and shows how, by taking Chinese business history seriously, we are afforded a unique opportunity to reimagine the future of business history as a whole.

The supplier acts as a leader to distribute one newsvendor-type product via the retailer in the uncertain market demand. In the presence of capital shortages, the retailer has two different financing alternatives: bank financing and trade credit. Moreover, the small-sized retailer has an imperfect credit rating, which reflects the exogenous credit risk beyond the current supply chain transaction. By capturing both the demand risk and credit risk, we model each financing strategy and derive the optimal solutions. When both financing strategies are feasible, we prove that the retailer always benefits from bank financing, while the supplier's preferences are determined by two critical factors (i.e., the retailer's credit rating and the production cost). Considering that the supplier's preferences are not always aligned with the retailer's, we characterize a wholesale price Pareto zone, in which trade credit is the unique equilibrium. We further generalize our model to consider that the retailer with a positive initial budget, finding that the feasible regions of two financing formats shrink as the initial budget builds up. Interestingly, when the initial capital of the retailer is moderate (still capital shortages), we observe that trade credit is more likely to be the financing equilibrium if the retailer's credit rating is low. These findings enrich our understanding of the impact of credit rating on financially constrained supply chain operational and financial decisions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bank financing; Capital constraint; Credit rating; Supply chain management; Trade credit","banking; capital flow; credit provision; economic impact; financial market; retailing; supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120629367

A multitude of ABMTs exists in marine areas within and beyond national jurisdiction, ranging from tools for the regulation of specific human activities (e.g. fisheries, shipping, or mining) to cross-sectoral tools (e.g. such as marine protected areas, MPAs, and marine spatial planning, MSP). By applying expert elicitation and reviewing scientific and grey literature we evaluate the contribution of ABMTs to sustainable development goals (SDGs) as set out under the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including for SDG 14 that directly addresses the conservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas, and marine resources. We find that fisheries-related and conservation-related ABMTs, and MSP offer the greatest potential contributions to SDG 14 and to SDGs in general. Moreover, there is high complementarity and synergy among different ABMTs for most SDG 14 targets and other SDGs, with the exception of SDG target 14.6 Prohibit fisheries subsidies and SDG 7 Affordable and clean energy. We find that some ABMTs contribute directly to goal attainment, while others contribute in more nuanced or even unexpected ways. Furthermore, context-specific factors that relate to political and legal factors, enforceability, transparency, governance structure, and inclusivity are crucial for unlocking the full potential of ABMTs of attaining multiple SDGs, as shown through examples. The major challenge to face in the next decade is ensuring durable and equitable outcomes from ABMT implementation by coordinating ABMT initiatives established by different organisations and responsible authorities. It is also critical that outcomes are monitored and evaluated across environmental, social, economic, governance, and health dimensions, with indicators addressing management effectiveness and not only ABMT area coverage. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Area-based management; Areas beyond national jurisdiction; Biodiversity; Conservation; Cooperation mechanisms; Marine/maritime spatial planning; Ocean governance; Other effective area-based conservation measures; Sustainable development","Biodiversity; Conservation; Environmental protection; Fisheries; Marine biology; Oceanography; Planning; Area beyond national jurisdiction; Area-based; Area-based management; Conservation measures; Cooperation mechanism; Effective area; Marine/maritime spatial planning; Ocean governance; Other effective area-based conservation measure; Spatial planning; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120474653

The present study deeply investigated the effect iron/carbon in anaerobic digestion for dichlorophen (DCP) degradation and methane production in synthetic DCP wastewater treatment. Results showed that nano-zero valent iron/activated carbon (nZVI/AC) and zero valent iron/activated carbon (ZVI/AC) gave higher chemical oxygen demand (COD) conversion (42.18% and 42.61%) and DCP removal (98.49 wt% and 99.00 wt%) in acidification step with better methane production from anaerobic digestion of the pretreated effluent. Same phenomenon occurred in the direct anaerobic degradation process due to the formation of galvanic cells between iron and carbon. In comparison, applying iron/carbon in acidification as pretreatment strategy plus following effluent anaerobic degradation showed higher efficiency in methane production and DCP removal than that of direct anaerobic degradation. Specifically, the methane production was 253.70 mL and 253.41 mL in subsequent anaerobic digestion system after nZVI/AC and ZVI/AC acidification pre-treatment, which was higher than 224.37 mL and 246.31 mL in direct anaerobic digestion system. Microbial community analysis showed that Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 was the dominated bacteria due to its important role in DCP wastewater treatment. Both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens were enhanced in iron/carbon added systems, which was also agreement with the strengthen in related genes involved in methanogenesis. In conclusion, the present work systematically investigated the enhancement role of iron/carbon system in anaerobic digestion for DCP wastewater treatment and paved way for future application. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Conductive materials; Dichlorophen wastewater; Digestion pathway; Microbial community","Acidification; Carbon; Chemical oxygen demand; Efficiency; Effluents; Iron; Methane; Microbial fuel cells; Microorganisms; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic degradation; Dichlorophen; Dichlorophen wastewater; Digestion pathway; Iron carbon; Methane production; Microbial communities; Nano zero-valent irons; Pre-treatments; Zero-valent iron; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120085258

Each instructor brings his/her training, experience, style, and capabilities to the classroom, making it notoriously difficult to establish a fair teaching quality metric. Commonly used metrics such as student evaluations are one-dimensional and cannot possibly capture all teaching quality elements. A better technique would identify each instructor's strengths on teaching-related activities, as well as places for improvement. While a perfect system may never be found, we present some guidance to broaden our understanding of teaching quality based on an application of service dominant logic and the joint co-creation of value between student and instructor. We also present one attempt to implement a framework, the Danish National Framework for Recognition of Teaching Qualifications, which provides a set of criteria that constitute quality teaching and can be used for assessing teaching qualifications. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Co-creation of value; Danish National Framework for recognition of teaching qualifications; Service dominant logic; Student evaluations; Teaching qualifications; Teaching quality",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85120053050

We interrelate concepts from recent research on the climate-heritage-nexus with contemporary coastal climate adaptation projects to reveal some of the complex realities and nuances that are apparent on the ground, and to raise heritage concerns for future practice. Questioning the role that heritage plays in specific climate adaptation projects from Denmark and the Netherlands, two low-lying countries with long coastlines facing climate risks, we show the wide range of roles that heritage can play in climate adaptation planning and we propose a framework to conceptualise heritage in this context. The study shows the important role that climate imaginaries (i.e. depictions, affect, and ways of apprehending the climate past) play in climate adaptation projects, and reveals national and local differences. Finally, we discuss the knowledge gained from climate adaption projects in terms of developing dynamic responses to climate change, of working with rather than against landscape processes, and the potential role of heritage in creating climate-resilient living environments. © 2021 The Author(s).

We examine cases in which lobbyists present themselves as upholders of science and of evidence-based policy, intervene directly in the methodological and ethical aspects of science for policy-making, thus imprinting their own agenda on the societal functions of science. We propose the existence of a process whereby private interest ascend an ideal ‘epistemic ladder’.

The damage is calculated using Xue's model, which takes into account the effect of tangential stresses on the damage evolution. The tangential stress is calculated using Wilson's mixed lubrication model taking into account the roughness of the tools. Strip reduction tests were performed on aluminium AA6082 specimens, with and without lubricant. The proposed numerical model is in good agreement with experiments and is able to predict the onset of galling.

This paper critically explores the role of autonomous (driverless) vehicles in plans for urban futures. By looking into the urban plans of 10 European capitals, we investigate the anticipated promises and hazards of autonomous vehicles. Theoretically, the paper draws upon critical urban mobilities studies that invite interlinking carbon reduction, smart cities and mobility planning. By examining these plans, the paper critically evaluates current urban planning for autonomous vehicles by asking whether one can identify any links to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals of sustainable cities and communities. A practice-based view on automation is then suggested as a pathway to promote a thorough sustainable mobility transition. It is concluded that none of the plans of the 10 capitals studied require AVs to integrate with public means of transport or to be fuelled by renewable energy sources. Hence, AVs are likely to individualise and intensify the existing automobility regime further and emissions are likely to increase, according to the comparative urban analysis. We therefore conclude that urban policy-making needs to contest the existing techno-centric conception of autonomous vehicles if these are to support the sustainable development goals of cities. © 2021 The Authors","Autonomous vehicles; Climate change; Smart cities; Sustainable development goals of cities; Sustainable mobilities paradigm; Urban governance","climate change; future prospect; mobility; smart city; sustainability; Sustainable Development Goal; unmanned vehicle; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118702794

Empirical evidence from our scenario-based experiments in the United Kingdom and the United States shows that identity changes occurring from organizational crises reduce organizational attractiveness and that anticipated self-continuity and anticipated self-esteem mediate this relationship. The effects become stronger with increasing crisis responsibility.

Why do individuals engage in intergroup conflict as often as they do? We propose that groups’ tendencies to present intergroup conflict as the default option and individuals’ tendencies to disproportionately choose default options fuel individual participation in intergroup conflict. Three experiments (total N = 893) that used incentivized economic games found support for this hypothesis. Designating intergroup conflict as the default option significantly increased individual participation in conflict relative to a no-default condition and to designating other behavioral options as defaults. The effects of defaults on intergroup conflict generalized across different social identities and levels of group identification. Our findings explain the stickiness of conflict and identify choice architecture as a potential solution: changing existing defaults can redirect intergroup behavior. We discuss promising directions for future research on the psychological mechanisms underlying these effects. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Decision making; Defaults; Group processes; Intergroup conflict",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117605233

The survey consists of multiple respondents from each company covering sales, operations, finance, and the S&OP process manager. Data reveals that there is a positive relationship between KBIs and S&OP efficiency among the respondents. Furthermore, data indicate that process efficiency is positively related to sales and operational performance. The results also reveal that firm-size controls the relationships between process efficiency and operational performance.

To answer this question, we make use of a detailed survey covering all academics employed at Danish universities in 2017. Empirically, we distinguish three groups of academics according to their international experience (stayers, returnee, and immigrants) and focus on entrepreneurial outcomes realized while residing in the host country, Denmark. The estimation of duration models reveals that returnees are more than 50% more likely to become academic entrepreneurs than stayers. Immigrants, however, were between 38 and 47% less likely to start a firm than returnees.

Experiments with new governance structures, such as New Public Management and New Public Governance, have challenged the traditional top-down, internally driven forms of innovation in the public sector and have entailed a search for new forms of open, collaborative and interactive innovation, implying a reframing of public innovation activities. However, introducing these new frames of innovation causes uncertainties in the public sector, necessitating better understanding of how public innovation can be changed to address societal needs. This paper uses materials from case studies of 21 public living labs across Europe to analyse the lessons that can be learned from public sector participation in living labs in terms of their contribution to reframing public innovation. The “frame” construct is used to analyse and provide an understanding of how participation in living labs helps public actors to reframe innovation and address public and societal needs. Three living lab framings for changing public innovation are identified (processual learning, restrained space and democratic engagement), and the degree of intensity of these framings with respect to involving stakeholders and addressing societal challenges is discussed. The paper contributes to knowledge of public sector innovation by extending previous accounts of how public innovation can be improved. © 2021","Framing theory; Living labs; Open innovation; Public innovation; Public service; Social innovation","Framing theory; Governance structures; Living lab; New public management; Open innovation; Public innovation; Public sector; Public services; Reframing; Social innovations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116036019

First, we argue that the largely separate literatures on ‘Crowd Science’ and ‘Citizen Science’ investigate strongly overlapping sets of projects but take different disciplinary lenses. Closer integration can enrich research on Crowd and Citizen Science (CS). Second, we propose a framework to profile projects with respect to four types of crowd contributions: activities, knowledge, resources, and decisions. This framework also accommodates machines and algorithms, which increasingly complement or replace professional and non-professional researchers as a third actor. Finally, we outline a research agenda anchored on important underlying organisational challenges of CS projects. This agenda can advance our understanding of Crowd and Citizen Science, yield practical recommendations for project design, and contribute to the broader organisational literature. © 2021 The Author(s).

Signed-up to be hyper-mobile Ph.D.-candidates, we became hyper-reflective pandemic intimates. We moved together into a space that felt safe, OUR safe space. Suspended. Did the pandemic open this door, or had this space always existed, even back in the old days? Probably the latter, although we were not sensitive enough to perceive it, too busy to push the door, too lonesome to CARE. Not attentive to its possibilities, not imaginative of its POWER, too confident to be capable of succeeding alone. Even if we might have secretly wished for this space to exist. The present piece of work, and JOY, might be described by others as a “side-step,” a “hobby project,” a “shadow activity.” For us, it is a recollection of shocks and wonders, a sentience of precious, ephemeral instances that last. We are a group of eight early career researchers who study global mobility and labor migration from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. With prior international mobility experience, we left our previous countries of residence in 2018 to join an EU-funded research project, whilst being located in different European cities. One could classify us, for example, as highly qualified, privileged migrants. The present paper is the outcome of a collaborative, auto-ethnographic study, conducted in 2020, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, when we suddenly were forced not to travel anymore. We got together online every week to “refaire le monde,” and we conducted virtual, dialogical self-interrogations and group reflections. Based on an emic approach, in line with Chang et al. (2013), we applied an iterative process of data collection and analysis. Our weekly conversations naturally emerged as a safe space for exchange and understanding, as we were facing similar situations, despite staying at different places. Suddenly, as the privilege of “always being on the move,” “always socializing and networking” disappeared due to closed borders and pandemic threats, we experienced anxieties and isolation and had to re-evaluate our perceptions on life, work, and international mobility. The very purpose and meaning of our broader research endeavors and employment perspectives suddenly faded away. We realized more than ever before, what it means to us to be allowed to move, to travel freely across continents. © 2021 The Authors.

Our aim is to conduct an ex-ante analysis focusing on these two external forces in the context of aquaculture and the adoption of aquaponics technology in Colombia. We use an embedded case-study design incorporating a qualitative and exploratory approach and employ two categories of fish-farming production systems as units of analysis. We triangulate our findings using non-probability sampling techniques and use our findings as a benchmark to discuss the potential adoption of aquaponics technology. Our findings suggest that fluctuations in rainfall and drought are the most important climate variables influencing negatively fish farming activities. Furthermore, we find that the complex institutional structures involved create unequal informal mechanisms among fish-farming production systems. We argue for context-specific designs when considering the adoption of aquaponics and conclude that, while fish-farming production systems encounter these external forces differently, heterogeneity also exists within systems, revealing intricacies worth considering. © 2021","Aquaponics; Climate change; Colombia; Fish farmers; Institutions; Technological innovation","Agriculture; Aquaculture; Decision making; Embedded systems; Fish; Amazonian region; Aquaponic; Case-studies; Colombia; Ex antes; External force; Fish farmer; Fish farming; Production system; Technological innovation; Climate change; artisanal fishery; climate change; decision making; fishery management; innovation; institutional framework; resource development; technological development; Amazonas [Colombia]; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114992000

The study was inspired by the micro sociological perspective of Arlie Hochschild, and findings are based on empirical material from focus groups of middle-aged Danish women who completed a three months research based exercise intervention (N = 51), and individual follow-up interviews (N = 21). We elucidate how the societal obligations of being successful at work, being a good mother, and being physically active creates a time bind in the everyday life of middle-aged women. Instead of having more leisure time, middle-aged women experience continuous time demands of work flexibility and performance, as well as new time demanding care duties linked to their children, parents, or grandchildren. We conclude that the personal leisure time of Danish women, exemplified by participation in an exercise intervention, is highly constrained by the time bind of market culture.

This study investigates the value of energy performance contracting in a two-echelon supply chain consisting of one supplier and two financially asymmetric manufacturers under carbon tax regulation for climate change mitigation. The supplier provides a trade credit for a financially weak manufacturer who engages in Cournot competition with a financially strong manufacturer. Furthermore, the supplier can act as an energy service company to offer energy performance contracting for the two manufacturers to achieve carbon tax savings. The impact of sharing ratio of energy performance contracting and coefficient of variable cost are analyzed to explore whether and which manufacturer should be chosen by the supplier to implement energy performance contracting. The results suggest that when the coefficient of variable cost is within a high range, the supplier will not provide energy performance contracting for any manufacturer. However, when the coefficient of variable cost and sharing ratio are not very high, the supplier prefers to provide energy performance contracting for the financially weak manufacturer. With the increasing of sharing ratio, the supplier changes the decision to select the financially strong one. Moreover, the model is extended to consider the impact of demand uncertainty and coefficient of investment cost. Furthermore, the result of numerical studies indicates that there exists a Pareto zone for the three supply chain members to achieve a multi-win situation, if the supplier provides the energy performance contracting for both the manufacturers. © 2021","Carbon emission abatement; Climate change mitigation; Energy performance contracting; Financially asymmetry; Supply chain management; Trade credit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113657764

However, its actual conceptual treatment in academic research is not necessarily clear or precise. Most research considers digital innovation as the final result of adopting digital technologies, such as new products, processes, services, or business models. In other words, this research advances the concept of digital innovation as an outcome. In parallel to this research on digital innovation as an outcome, the concept of digital innovation as a process has emerged, linking innovation capabilities, organizational structures, boundaries, and technology management in organisations. The scattered existing research on digital innovation as a process explores the anatomy of the digital transformation of the innovation process by focusing on its phases, underlying mechanisms, barriers, and enabling factors. We argue that management research should pay more attention to this perspective on digital innovation. Therefore, in this essay, we take stock of research on the topic and identify four orchestration mechanisms that are inherently processual, enabling the firm to effectively coordinate and leverage different types of resources to create and capture value through the adoption and exploitation of digital technologies in the innovation process. Based on these orchestration mechanisms, we develop an agenda for future research that will hopefully inform further scholarly inquiry in the field of digital innovation. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Digital innovation; digital technologies; digital transformation; innovation process",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112212734

We use data from more than 90 countries and apply multivariate regressions for two different periods (January–June 2020 and July–December 2020). We control for a number of variables, including the Covid-19 Government Response Stringency Index, which is very comprehensive in its conceptualization. Using 2SLS estimators, we provide evidence that countries with higher levels of domestic travels experienced higher levels of COVID-19 cases and deaths over the first six months of pandemic. However, domestic tourism decorrelated with the pandemic spread from July to December 2020. Theoretically, we demonstrate that during the early stages of Covid-19, domestic tourism is potentially a vector of the virus spread, but once a country is hit by the pandemic, other local factors take precedence. Practically, these findings provide empirical support to governments policies to restrict residents’ non-essential domestic travels to reduce spreading the virus during the first few months of the pandemic. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","COVID-19 contamination; Domestic tourism; mobility; travel restrictions",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112051074

This limits our understanding of administrative burdens and their impact in public policy. Through a survey experiment on 1.116 unemployment insurance fund beneficiaries in Denmark, we test whether activating impressions from onerous experiences with the unemployment system affects psychological beliefs central to job search and (un)employment: job search locus of control and attribution of unemployment responsibility. We show that experiences of onerous demands and complicated rules externalize respondents' locus of control and increase their propensity to attribute responsibility for unemployment to their unemployment insurance fund and its employees.

To fill up some of that gap, this study draws on the resource-based view of the firm and the innovation-value-capturing-framework to identify and characterise complementary assets utilised to materialise the competitive advantage of environmental management practices (EMP) in SMEs.

However, the same qualities that make data so appreciated–that is, their volume, their value for a plurality of stakeholders and their indefinite reuse capacity–also have a dark side: data reuse can lead to deviant data use that undermines the legitimacy of data analytics initiatives. To investigate this dynamic, we build on the notion of data ecosystems and provide empirical evidence from a longitudinal, 15-year case study of the emergence, expansion and eventual collapse of a large-scale data analytics project–called DAMD–in the Danish health care sector. We demonstrate that data reuse in the evolving data ecosystem elicited a data reuse dark side that was so dominant that it eventually resulted in the project’s demise. We conceptualise the reuse dark side’s three major mechanisms as function creep, stakeholder creep and data creep.

PiS employs shame in its strategy of emotion regulation in mediated party communication in pro-government media outlets. We suggest that there are two pillars of shame that underpin support for PiS: (1) the collective shame that originates from the perceived cultural inferiority of Poland in relation to the West/Europe, and (2) the individual shame of failing to achieve material prosperity in the context of the post-communist economic transformation. We examine how shame and pride have been instrumentalised in the coverage of the 2019 European Parliament elections by the right-wing media outlet wPolityce.pl.

Using semi-structured interviews, we follow up on three organisations that are long-term adopters of the BSC. We find that the motives for adopting the BSC do not follow the conventional model whereby early adopters have economic (rational) and late adopters non-economic (social) motives, but that these motives interact during the diffusion process. These organisations reframed the BSC and bundled it with other practices to achieve a better cultural, technical and political fit (i.e. top-management-related factors and IT systems). Cultural misfits are the most formative and can overpower technical and political aspects of fit. This has led to management practices that differ from the original design of the BSC. Also, we critically assess consequences of the BSC adoptions. Even adopters emphasising economic motives for adopting the BSC did not attempt to assess its ex-post financial impact. Thereby, our study contributes a critical view on fashionable management innovations. © 2021 University of South Australia.","adoption; Balanced Scorecard; critical management studies; diffusion as classification; diffusion theory; organizational culture; performance measurement; Sumit Lodhia; upper echelons",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109348546

Taking its departure from the research field of creative labour in the cultural industries and research on the platformization of podcasts, this article explores the inherent tensions between creativity and commerce that independent podcasters experience specifically in relation to paid subscription platforms. This is done by conducting and analysing qualitative interviews with four Danish independent podcasters (The Bad Judges, The Tear Channel, Childless Birds, and Third Ear) who have decided to become exclusive content on Podimo, thereby intensifying the shift from being free labour to paid labour. Interviews are combined with transcriptions of podcast episodes in which podcasters seek to justify why they joined Podimo. The analysis reveals commerce, autonomy and discovery as the podcasters’ key motivations, while their overriding concern is the drop of listeners’ numbers. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","creative labour; cultural industries; paid subscription; platform; podcasters; podcasting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108974256

For a given building, the method examines the ratio between enclosed and open spaces, i.e. mono-purpose spaces versus open, flexible, multi-purpose spaces. From here, the method systematically collected and synthesized normalized features to compare and balance operational costs and utilization with user needs and satisfaction. To demonstrate the method, we apply it to a newly constructed university building in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. For this case example, initial investment and operation costs for interior and technical equipment are drawn from space inventories and are then supplemented with space-utilization rates from sensors and booking reference systems. User feedback from the distinct spaces are then integrated into the assessment metrics, forming the baseline for improving the ratio between open and enclosed spaces within higher education facilities.

In order to develop such radical innovations, organizational separation of innovation efforts has been advocated by many as an effective strategy. We have conducted a longitudinal case study of a radical innovation project at a born-digital company. The company established a separate organization to develop radical innovation, but over time, the innovation drifted from radical to incremental. Even keeping the organization separate proved difficult. In explaining the events in the case study, we follow the argument that new theories of digital innovation can be developed with reference to the specific properties of digital artefacts. We outline how properties like editability and distributability may contribute to innovation drift, i.e., the proclivity of radical innovation ambitions to gradually drift towards more incremental realizations. Due to their nature, digital artefacts can diffuse through the organization and, thus, pose a challenge to the effectiveness of organizational separation as a strategy for innovation. With this work, we contribute to the literature on digital innovation by responding to calls for research on new theories of digital innovation and the demand for greater appreciation of digital materiality in organizing. We also challenge the prevailing view of digital innovations as radical and aim to open a debate on the possibility and considerations surrounding incremental digital innovations. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; digital artifacts; Digital innovation; organizational structures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108604629

We apply a systematic framework to a comparative case study of three regional STPs in Thailand and analyse the effects of varying conditions along five dimensions: urbanisation, industrial structure, regional institutions and culture, university and research institutes, and financial resources in relation to the performance of each STP. The three Thai regions are similar in both size and levels of urbanisation and are governed by the same national programme for STP development, which provides a good methodological set-up for analysing the effects of varying regional contexts. Findings reveal that positive STP development is grounded in the presence of an innovative culture in regions driven by an active collaboration among local actors. Moreover, despite STPs being located in the same national innovation system, different regional contextual factors result in different levels of STP performance. A holistic understanding of these regional connections can help improve designs of STPs, and other supportive policies that are important for regional innovation development. © KOSIME, ASIALICS, STEPI 2020.","developing countries; regional context; regional innovation systems; science; Science and technology parks; technology and innovation policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106818586

Therefore, this study investigates IT diffusion practices from the perspective of supply-side agents. Drawing from a longitudinal case of development, sale, and institutionalisation of a healthcare information system, this article proposes a model of the supply side of technology diffusion. The model shows that diffusion depends on supply-side agents engaging in practices that are both demanding and possibly misaligned with traditional agent practices.

We also find lower expenditures when businesses have contracted with governments in the past, a finding that suggests that experience can lower the risks of a failed transaction.

Drawing on the selective accessibility model (SAM), this paper examines in the context of food brands (a) the joint effect of perceived brand authenticity and advertising images on consumers’ purchase intentions toward the advertised food product; (b) the mechanism that drives consumers’ purchase intentions, in which perceived similarity functions as a mediator; and (c) the moderating function of role overload in these relationships.

Both HRM approaches affect the QM techniques and performance positively.

Only for the GS techniques, the effects of control- and commitment-oriented HRM on performance are not statistically significantly different.

Additionally, the results demonstrate that control-oriented HRM supports the QM techniques better in improving performance than commitment-oriented HRM for most groups of QM techniques studied.

Including usage and awareness of the FA concussion guidelines, concussion education rates of players and coaching staff, and collection of baseline concussion assessments. Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire study distributed online by organisations including or representing medical staff working in elite football in the United Kingdom. Results: 120 responses were gathered. High awareness rates of the FA guidelines were found (97%) with variable rates of player and coaching staff concussion education. Baseline concussion assessments were collected by 78%. Of those, 99% collected SCAT5 with low rates of other neuro-psychometric testing (17%). Confidence of pitch-side SRC recognition was high (93% feeling very confident or confident). Introduction of a ‘concussion’ substitute was seen as strongly positive for player welfare (85% strongly agreeing or agreeing). Conclusions: Awareness of FA concussion guidelines, and collection of SCAT5 baseline testing was high. Player and coaching staff concussion education rates were low, as was the use of neuro-psychometric testing beyond the use of the SCAT5. There was strong support the introduction of a ‘concussion’ substitute being a positive thing for player welfare. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","assessment; doctor; physiotherapist; Soccer; strategy; therapist","brain concussion; cross-sectional study; football; human; medical staff; pilot study; Brain Concussion; Cross-Sectional Studies; Football; Humans; Medical Staff; Pilot Projects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101877267

Our particular reading highlights Pragmatism’s emphasis on process and emergence, its theory of knowing as fallible and experimental, its denouncing of dualisms, its future-oriented meliorism, its sensitivity to ethics and democracy, and its positioning of experience as both the start and end of inquiry, arguing that these features lay invaluable groundwork for the study of organization and organizing.

Sometimes their innovations are useful to others and potentially enhance social welfare. Unfortunately, diffusion fails as consumers lack incentives to inform others. Online knowledge sharing platforms (OKSPs), which can be stimulated with government support, may alleviate this problem. Platform communication may trigger passive consumers into active knowledge contributors. It is however uncertain if and how platform communication affects consumers who never shared designs before. We conducted a randomised controlled experiment with 715 members of an OKSP in 3D printing. Our intervention included a series of general and personal messages, tailored to various motives to share knowledge: altruism, status, ideology, learning and community. Platform members who never uploaded designs before are positively influenced by our intervention. Specifically, messages tailored to altruism, ideology and learning made platform members upload more designs. Hence, platform communication can improve the availability of innovative designs to potential adopters, and is a useful step to alleviate diffusion failure of consumer innovations. © 2021 The Author(s).

The study differentiates between two types of authoritarian support: specific support (authoritarian support based on evaluation of recent policies) and diffuse support (long-term authoritarian traits independent of recent policies). I find that education expansion has significantly decreased specific authoritarian support; however, it has not influenced diffuse authoritarian support. Moreover, a decrease in traditional gender attitudes is driven by a cohort effect rather than an education expansion effect.

Storytelling is understood as the process through which actors reconstruct their experiences and appear in a collective space. Storytelling is thus enacted within and from spaces and is a means for political action. Three theoretical consequences are drawn. First, storytelling implies the ever-present possibility of a ‘space of appearance’ in which the subject is an originator of action. Second, the notion of storytelling as a spatial practice implies focusing on how stories are shaped through interactions and collective engagements, or ‘emplacement’. Third, a material and embodied reconfiguration of Arendt’s notion of action shows how material relations offer important affordances to change organizations. Because storytelling is both a process of engaging with ourselves and the power relations that we are part of, Arendt’s notion of storytelling is helpful for understanding how and in what circumstances we can act politically in organizations. In particular, the article argues that Arendt’s account is useful for framing an interventionist third stream of critical management studies, or ‘critical performativity’. © The Author(s) 2020.","Action; Hannah Arendt; power; space of appearance; storytelling; subjectivity in organizations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099759519

To many, they are the antithesis of predatory bottom-line business ventures, and to others, they are an under-regulated vehicle for immature, or unscrupulous project owners to exploit inexperienced and vulnerable investors. These differences are significant, given many use crowdfunding to build public awareness and project a positive image. We use the myth of Prometheus–the Greek god associated with “defiant progress” and technological advancement–as a sensitising lens to build a set of competing, dialectic archetypes. We then apply these archetypes through a Hegelian dialectic analysis of three high-profile crowdfunding campaigns. The overarching contribution of the study is that it provides a foundation for discussion of the positive and negative narratives surrounding crowdfunded project owners and explicates the limitations of crowdfunding as an enabler of positive systemic change. The dialectic approach provides a systematic means of identifying the essence of disagreement between narratives. While it may be too early to predict the outcomes for emerging technology-driven initiatives such as crowdfunding, the use of myth offers a sophisticated means to look for “rhyming” phenomena, where the phenomena at play are similar to the grand frailties of humankind throughout history. © Operational Research Society 2020.","Brian Pentland; Crowdfunding; dialectic; Kickstarter; Michael Myers; myth; Prometheus","Information systems; Bottom lines; Business ventures; Emerging technologies; Project owners; Prometheus; Public awareness; Technological advancement; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098582759

The results not only demonstrate the significant positive effect of CSR practices on sustainability performance in the context of manufacturing networks, but also suggest that the age and the social orientation of plants can have impacts on sustainability performance. Furthermore, the results reveal that interplant coordination plays a role in moderating the relationship between CSR practices and the social dimension of sustainability performance, but not on the environmental dimension. This paper contributes to the existing literature related to both sustainable and global operations by extending the current discussions on the relationship between CSR practices and sustainability performance to a new context and elaborating the role of a different kind of coordination in moderating this relationship.

To deal with these limitations, we collect survey responses from 3,384 local politicians from four countries on seven dimensions of the political-bureaucratic relationship. We then use cluster analysis to develop six images bottom-up. Five of our images are largely consistent with APR's image II and III. Yet, they differ in the extent to which politicians trust the bureaucracy, consider them loyal, and see them as an important source of information. A sixth image is not consistent with any of APR's images. We find that both systemic (country, municipality size) and individual factors (ideology, position, seniority) contribute to differences in images.

A fixed effects model and a cross-section model both indicated that although food expenditures rose slightly with organic consumption, the increase was considerably less than had been suggested by organic price premiums at product level. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Food consumption; food expenditures; organic consumption; panel data regression; purchase data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097129499

It argues that Soiuzutil’waste paper handling attempted to form a new socialist collective by reworking old print while cultivating citizens as classless scrap-collectors, for the sake of an (ir)rational resource optimization. While World War II intensified recycling efforts among the Allied and Axis powers, invasion and evacuation damaged Soviet waste collection to a point where no return of paper into a centralized system was possible. War forced printers and consumers to retreat to local self-supply networks, as paper remained a crucial, yet scarce resource. By analyzing technical-educational literature and correspondence of the reutilization offices, the article demonstrates the changing attitudes in the Stalinist war economy, the industries, and the population towards mobilizing and saving paper. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","paper history; print culture; Soiuzutil’; Soviet Union; war economy; waste utilization; World War II","economic history; industrialization; pulp and paper industry; recycling; war; waste management; USSR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096101091

Changing this issue requires new knowledge on the labour-intensive construction production system. The work sampling method was applied to collect data from three renovation construction production systems. It quantifies observations of on-site work and enables deep analyses of how time is used. The analysis revealed that the renovation projects had a baseline of value-adding-work (VAW) time on 29.5%. It further identified five system behaviours outlining how VAW and Non-Value-Adding work (NVAW) time behaves. The new knowledge of how both VAW and NVAW time behaves advances knowledge on how time is wasted in construction projects and opens new branches of future research. The findings are furthermore of potential use to industry professionals who work with process improvement in renovation projects because they provide, among others, answers to how targets can be defined for both VAW and NVAW. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behaviour; direct work; improvement; lean; management; production system; productivity; refurbishment; renovation; TFV theory; waste; work sampling","Sampling; Construction labours; Construction projects; Industry professionals; Labour-intensive; Non value-adding works; Process Improvement; Production system; Value-adding work; Productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095794718

By drawing on empirical materials on responses to unfairness criticisms raised against target-setting practices in a bank, the study shows that such legitimation work also requires responding to equity-related criticisms. Equity implies that, when situations differ, targets must be differentiated to make the intensity of efforts the same. This study shows that legitimately differentiating targets requires an original and highly complex commensuration work. This work is original because compared to prior commensuration studies it concerns the commensuration of efforts and not of entities. This work is complex because it is difficult to account for all differences during target-setting and because such differentiation can be made mechanically and discretionally, each form of differentiation bringing its own source of illegitimacy. Moreover, it is also complex because it is a distributed work, involving numerous actors with multiple concerns. Such commensuration work then appears to be continuous and dynamic. This complements prior studies in target-setting, which have focussed mainly on dyadic relations between a superior and a subordinate and on single-period adjustments to targets. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Commensuration work; Equity; Fairness; Legitimacy; Target-setting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095788147

But can micro-CSR research in its current form realize this transformative potential and serve social justice? Adopting an intellectual activist position, we argue that the transformative potential of micro-CSR is severely limited by its predominant focus on CSR as defined, presented, and promoted by companies themselves, thereby serving to sustain the hegemony of the business case for CSR, promoting narrow interests and maintaining managerial control over corporate responsibilities. We propose that micro-CSR researchers broaden the scope of their research to cultivate the potential of alternative ideas, voices, and activities found in organizational life. In so doing we lay out a research agenda that embraces employee activism, listens to alternative voices, and unfolds confrontational, subversive, and covert activities. In the hope of inspiring other micro-CSR researchers to explore these unconventional paths, we also offer suggestions as to how we can pursue them through empirical research. © The Author(s) 2020.","corporate social responsibility; critical performativity; employee activism; intellectual activism; micro-CSR","article; empirical research; employee; human; social responsibility; voice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094945839

Changes to an MC element such as a performance measurement system, however, may in turn create incoherence with other, non-changed elements, generating a need for more changes, and thus trigger a cascade effect. To date, however, we know little about how this sequential process unfolds and what managers can do to deal with incoherence. This paper contributes by enhancing the understanding of sequential changes, drawing on the organizational ecology literature, and we empirically inform our research with a five-year longitudinal case study. Our data illustrates in detail how initial MC changes, intended to cope with an environmental shift, trigger a cascade effect. This sequential process results in an extensive change period, during which various incoherent MC elements coexist. Our study acknowledges that incoherence among MC elements can decrease control effectiveness by creating intra-organizational frictions, yet we highlight the role of managers in mitigating such negative effects. Specifically, we show how managers can alleviate the unfavorable effects of incoherence by changing their use of performance measures in order to better facilitate organizational dialogue, learning and problem solving. © 2020 European Accounting Association.","Change; Management Control; Organizational Ecology; Performance Measurement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091302969

By changing individuals’ preferences for engaging in both productive and non-productive activities across their lifespan, changes in life expectancy paradoxically affect both the financing and the costs of social welfare systems. This raises the importance of knowledge on how life expectancy affects the relationship between age and entry to entrepreneurship. Using lifespan theory, we propose a conceptual model for understanding how age-related psychological effects (i.e., risk-willingness and self-efficacy) on individuals’ entry to entrepreneurship are embedded in life expectancy at the societal level. Based on data from 34 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, our analysis shows that increased life expectancy at the societal level moves the peak for entrepreneurial entry toward older ages and creates an evener entry distribution across working ages. The results suggest that this effect is driven partly by a cross-level moderation from life expectancy on the relationship between age and individuals’ risk-willingness and self-efficacy, which in turn promotes entry to entrepreneurship. These findings highlight the importance of considering entrepreneurial activity in the context of age and of future-time perspective in terms of life expectancy. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aging; Future-time perspective; Life expectancy; Lifespan theory; Nascent entrepreneurship; Remaining lifetime",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089784879

But is this true for all types of visions? Must the organizational vision be society-oriented?

Police and counseling units are people-processing organizations with different service logics, and the content of the visions differs, both between police and counseling and within the two functional areas. This enables us to investigate whether vision content moderates the association between transformational leadership and PSM.

However, a common understanding of these phenomena is hindered by disciplinary boundaries and disconnected research streams. We link dispersed knowledge on Open Innovation, Open Science, and related concepts such as Responsible Research and Innovation by proposing a unifying Open Innovation in Science (OIS) Research Framework. This framework captures the antecedents, contingencies, and consequences of open and collaborative practices along the entire process of generating and disseminating scientific insights and translating them into innovation. Moreover, it elucidates individual-, team-, organisation-, field-, and society‐level factors shaping OIS practices. To conceptualise the framework, we employed a collaborative approach involving 47 scholars from multiple disciplines, highlighting both tensions and commonalities between existing approaches.

Based on participant observation in an outdoor tourism cluster project and qualitative interviews with other tourism and regional development actors on the Baltic island of Bornholm, Denmark, this research asks how the micro-entrepreneurs and volunteer event organizers contribute to rural destination development, and how their contributions can best be supported by regional development actors. Drawing on the concepts of placial engagement and translocal connections, the research shows that micro-entrepreneurs’ and volunteer event organizers’ mobility and multi-local place engagement, combined with their orientation towards goals other than profit maximation, represent a strong rural place-development potential–a potential that tends to be undervalued by established tourism and regional development actors. The small-scale outdoor tourism actors show strong collaborative and networking behaviour regarding business, product, and place development. In addition to (modest) tourism-generated income and (often part-time) employment, they contribute by providing new residents, business diversity and flexibility, translocal resources and knowledge, as well as actively engage in place-making and branding. These diverse qualities can be argued to strengthen innovation, attractiveness and community resilience in economically challenged rural areas. The relevance of using a translocal perspective on tourism entrepreneurship and rural destination development is exemplified by the article in its presentation of the wider development contributions of the micro outdoor tourism actors which are important to acknowledge for regional development actors to build on them strategically. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bornholm; collaboration; Denmark; destination development; micro-entrepreneurs; Outdoor tourism; placial embeddedness; resilience; rural development; translocalism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088977946

In so doing, we first situate corporate activism in relation to the more established fields of political corporate social responsibility and corporate social responsibility communication, focusing on discussions concerning the interplay between talk and action as well as the potential of talk to lead to action. On this basis, we propose a conceptual framework that posits talk and action as operating conjointly on the ontological plane of s(t)imulation, a conceptual conjunction of simulation and stimulation that is inspired by Baudrillard’s notion of the simulacrum. Empirically, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 20 examples of corporate advertising that has been reported as anti-Trump in the media. We find that the advertising in our sample is characterized by the following three main distinctions: (1) humorous references to Trump, (2) favourable and highly emotional appeals to social justice and (3) dystopian visions of society. We argue that a postmodern perspective on signs and representation may not only nuance our understanding of corporate activism, but also contribute to the conceptualization of the phenomenon by pushing the explanatory framework beyond the dialectic of talk and action. © The Author(s) 2020.","Advertising; content analysis; corporate activism; corporate responsibility; Donald Trump",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088286171

It is thus argued that self-help books are reflective of wider cultural dynamics and concomitant normative pressures directed at the subject in contemporary capitalism, which among other things promote the absence of criticism in the workplace. The empirical point of departure for this argument is the two bestselling and culturally resonant self-help books The Secret by Rhonda Byrne and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey. Theoretically, the article applies Butler’s notion of ‘implicit censorship’ where censorship is understood as productive in the sense of being constitutive of language and subjects. Hence, in the analysis, it is shown how discursive regimes in self-help literature tend to be constructed in such a way that extroverted criticism cannot emerge as a meaningful activity, and is thus implicitly censored. © The Author(s) 2020.","Employee silence; foreclosure; implicit censorship; Judith Butler; self-help",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087975944

Interest in the circular economy (CE) concept of slowing, narrowing and closing material loops through CE strategies (reuse, repair, refurbish, recycle and recover) has grown in recent years to facilitate minimising these unresolved issues emanating from the building industry. Although CE initiatives are proliferating within the industry, wide-scale adoption of CE is still lacking, and the current development and implementation of CE building design and construction strategies is fragmented. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), this study assesses which design and construction strategies are being linked to the concept of CE for new buildings, and their level of application and readiness in a building context. On this basis, the study offers insight into how this field of research is developing and provides directions for future research. From the SLR, a taxonomy is presented that groups the strategies together into 16 overarching building design and construction strategies. An important gap preventing a greater CE uptake within the industry was found to include the lack of knowledge about the environmental performance and related benefits of the various building design and construction strategies. Thus, it is suggested that conveying more comprehensive and uniform adoption of CE in the building industry requires the development of a new design typology to facilitate CE-oriented decision-making in a building context and that prioritises the strategies according to their potential in terms of minimising building-related environmental impacts. © 2020 The Author(s).

Several competitions and leagues have been cancelled or postponed. Players have firstly been forced to training in solitude. In a second stage, players start training in small groups with strict contact restriction and return to competitive play might occur after only few weeks of normal team training preparation. These special circumstances are likely to impact football performance and injury risk in the upcoming competitions. Thus, clubs, coaching and medical staff, as well as players are challenged on the prioritization of fitness and performance, which easily can create several “catch-22-dilemmas”. The present article presents views on fitness training, physical preparation and recovery during these uncommon conditions, and how elite football players can return to the competitive field well-prepared for post-crisis football endeavours around the world. Due to the multifaceted physiological demands in elite football, the long recovery requirements after match-play and an upcoming reality with many games within a short period, elite football players, managers and clubs may face extraordinary challenges associated with return to play under the current circumstances. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fatigue; Fitness training; injury; performance; recovery; soccer; testing",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085296349

Its contribution is a critical conceptualization of how collaborative tourism design can facilitate sustainable transformation. Recognizing SDG #17 to “Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development” we argue that collaboration–not only partnerships and cooperation–should be a central tenet for intentional change. Collaboration rests on the hypothesis that the sum is more than its individual parts. We introduce how the collaborative design (co-design) of tourism contributes a unique range of processes, methods, tools and notably an attitude of mind that enables its practitioners to, with others, explore, reveal, encompass and address issues and nuances in an overall sustainable tourism co-design process. This understanding deliberately challenges the notion that a sustainable development process can be planned and micro-managed with pre-determined outcomes. Examples from Denmark and Norway illustrate how sustainable tourism co-design intentionally aims to transform human relations, encourage stewardship and demonstrate how such a practice does not reach for quick-fix solutions. Findings indicate that we have yet to realize the power of collaboration, stewardship and “other-regarding” ethics to guide actions underpinning SDG#17 for more sustainable and resourceful futures. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Collaborative design; SDGs; stewardship; sustainable tourism sevelopment","conceptual framework; Sustainable Development Goal; tourism development; tourism management; Denmark; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085006825

Our main hypothesis is that the two types of activities can substitute each other so that group inclusiveness becomes less important for feeling involved if group achievement is high. Using a multilevel approach and responses from 1124 individuals in 29 multicultural technical work groups in private business organizations and universities, we confirm our theoretical assumptions.

However, in spite of the fact that the Scandinavian countries have implemented policies and initiated programmes to ensure gender diversity in all sectors and levels of society since the mid-1970s and beginning of the 1980s, progress is generally slow. Nonetheless, the three countries differ regarding public and political attention on the issue and hence on policies, intensity of implementation and management of gender equality policies. In this article, we focus on the representation of Scandinavian women in leadership positions in larger companies and academia, and discuss the scope and intensity of gender equality policies and their effects. Finally, we highlight key lessons learned from decades of gender equality work in the three countries. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","academia; companies; diversity policy; Gender diversity; Scandinavian countries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074912167
