However, urban environments also offer unique prospects for biological conservation, with multiple benefits for humans and other species. We present seven ecological principles to conserve and increase the biodiversity of cities, using metaphors to bridge the gap between the languages of built-environment and conservation professionals. We draw upon John Ruskin's famous essay on the seven lamps of architecture, but more generally on the thinking of built-environment pioneers such as Patrick Geddes (1854–1932) who proposed a synoptic view of the urban environment that included humans and non-humans alike. To explain each principle or ‘lamp’ of urban biodiversity, we use an understanding from the built-environment disciplines as a base and demonstrate through metaphor that planning for the more-than-human does not require a conceptual leap. We conclude our discussion with ten practical strategies for turning on these lamps in cities. Urban planners, architects, landscape architects, engineers and other built-environmental professionals have a key role to play in a paradigm shift to plan for the more-than-human, because of their direct influence on the evolving urban environment. This essay is intended to increase dialogue between ecologists and members of these professions, and thus increase the biodiversity of cities around the world. © 2018 The Authors","Architecture; Geddes; Landscape architecture; Planning; Ruskin; Urban ecology","architectural design; biodiversity; planning theory; urban ecosystem; urban planning; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048732668

However, edge service management is challenged by high hardware heterogeneity and missing elasticity capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the concept of elastic services. Elastic services are situation aware and can adapt themselves to the current execution environment dynamically to adhere to their Service Level Objectives (SLOs). This adaptation is achieved through Diversifiable Programming (DivProg), a new programming model which uses function annotations as interface between the service logic, its SLOs, and the execution framework. DivProg enables developers to characterize their services in a way that allows a third-party execution framework to run them with the flow and the parametrization that conforms to changing SLOs. We develop a prototype and perform an experimental evaluation which shows that elastic services can seamlessly adapt to heterogeneous platforms and scale with a wide range of input sizes, while adhering to their SLOs with little programming effort. © 2018 IFIP.","Adaptive; IoT; Programming model; Services","Computation theory; Routing algorithms; Telecommunication services; Adaptive; Execution environments; Execution framework; Experimental evaluation; Heterogeneous platforms; Programming models; Service level objective; Services; Edge computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060941320

This issue is particularly challenging because of the large number of vessels and trips that need to be monitored and the remoteness of vessels at sea. Several options exist in theory, ranging from patrol vessels to onboard observers and self-sampling. Increasingly though, technology is developing to provide remote Electronic Monitoring (EM) with cameras at lower costs. This chapter first provides an overall synthesis of the pro's and con's of several monitoring tools and technologies. Four EM technologies already trialled in EU fisheries are then summarised. We conclude that it is now possible to conduct reliable and cost-effective monitoring of unwanted catches at sea, especially if various options are used in combination. However, effective monitoring is a necessary condition for the successful implementation of the Landing Obligation but insufficient unless it is implemented with a high level of coverage and with the support of the fishing industry. © The Author(s) 2019.","Compliance; Electronic monitoring; Observers; Unreported discards; Video",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085158135

This will include strategies on where and when to fish but also on how to fish, which we examine here. In particular, we focus on ways to encourage and support fishers to design, develop and test selective gears that will avoid unwanted catches in the first place. To this end, we highlight the necessity to increase awareness of existing solutions, the importance of understanding the capture process and how fish react to fishing gears, and the need to evaluate the economic implications of new gears. We examine the success of science-industry collaborations and emphasise the benefits of a flexible regulatory environment. Looking ahead, the fishing industry needs to keep up-to-date with new technologies that can be used to observe the interaction of fish and their gears and with new approaches to modifying selectivity. © The Author(s) 2019.","Catch avoidance; Discard reduction; Fish reactions to fishing gear; Industry participation; Selective fishing gears",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085158088

Icelandic food and biotech R and D, Reykjavík, Iceland","The purpose of this chapter is to discuss challenges that the EU Landing Obligation presents to the onboard handling of unwanted catches and how vessel layout modifications can be applied to meet these challenges. The key challenge the industry is facing is having to bring ashore catches of little or no value, which requires significant effort to handle and takes up valuable space that is, in many cases, not available. Considering that 85% of EU fishing vessels are under 12 metres long and 97% are under 24 metres, it is evident that the majority of the EU fleet has limited options when it comes to handling and stowage of catches that would have been discarded prior to the implementation of the Landing Obligation. The Landing Obligation only applies to species subject to catch limits, which means that the current set-up on vessels can, for the most part, accommodate the fish of legal size that needs to be landed. The main challenge is catches of undersized fish that are not permitted to be used for direct human consumption. For those catches, the simplest approach is to handle them as targeted catch, which will allow them to be used for higher-value products such as pet food, pharmaceuticals, food supplements, etc. This is, however, not applicable for the majority of the fleet, due to a lack of space and the labour effort required. Solutions such as bulk storage and simple silage preservation are alternatives that are being explored for smaller vessels. The larger vessels have more options, such as full silage production, fish protein hydrolysate and fish meal production. © The Author(s) 2019.","Automated classification; Bulk landing; Fish protein; Fish silage; Hydrolysate; MCRS; Onboard handling; Vessel modifications",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085158047

This chapter describes key aspects for the successful management of Baltic cod such as the long history of scientific data collection for stock assessment and cod management as well as a well-documented history of work aimed at increased selectivity in cod trawls. We then analyse how the scientific data used for stock assessment has been affected by the LO and how the knowledge of Baltic cod selectivity has been used and developed since its introduction. We conclude that in spite of many good prerequisites, the introduction of the LO in Baltic cod fisheries has been unsuccessful and has failed to deliver any of the expected benefits. Data quality for stock assessments has deteriorated, discarding of cod has not decreased despite a reduced minimum size and there are no indications of increased gear selectivity in the fishery. Finally, we propose potential explanations for this failure and recommend actions that may be needed to make the Landing Obligation more successful. © The Author(s) 2019.","Baltic sea; Common fisheries policy; Discard ban; Discards; European union; Regionalisation; Selectivity; Trawl",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085156924

In this chapter, we focus on how genetics can be applied under the EU Landing Obligation, to identify and prevent unwanted catches and to estimate the composition of products made from such catches. Three themes are covered: (i) the genetic identification of bycatch; (ii) the genetic analysis of species composition in nutritional products made from unwanted fish; (iii) the potential of using so-called environmental DNA (DNA shedded from aquatic organisms into the water) to reduce bycatch. For all themes, we introduce and explain the relevant genetic techniques, including data formats and analyses. We present the most significant limitations of the methodologies for their implementation in fisheries and provide examples of their use through relevant case studies. Finally, we discuss the potential future perspectives, with emphasis on the rapid progress in portable and automatic DNA devices, which may revolutionize the use of real-time onsite genetic analyses. © The Author(s) 2019.","Discard; Environmental DNA; Fisheries bycatch; Genetics; Species composition; Species identification",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085155320

Fisheries discards are often seen as an important food source for marine scavengers so the reduction of discards due to the Landing Obligation may affect their populations. The literature on scavenging in marine ecosystems is considerable, due to its importance in the trophic ecology of many species. Although discards undoubtedly contribute to these species' food sources, few can be seen to be solely dependent on carrion (including discards). Ecosystem models predicted that discards contributed very little to the diet of scavengers at a regional scale. A reduction in discards through the Landing Obligation may therefore affect populations for a few species in some areas, but generally this is unlikely to be the case. But it is challenging to identify how important discards might be to scavengers, as they are taxonomically diverse and vary in the role they play in scavenging interactions. © The Author(s) 2019.","Carrion; Discard consumption; Food subsidies; Food web models; Scavengers",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085155198

In this chapter we look at how they might be able to do that by summarising a number of studies conducted in various European regions. We start by describing a series of ""challenge"" trials where fishers tried to reduce their discards by whatever (legal) means they thought best. In some cases, they were able to reduce unwanted catches, in others they were less successful. We also interviewed fishers not involved in the trials to ask them what they thought they could do. We explore their approaches which generally fell into three categories: more selective gear; tactical and strategic changes; and management changes. Scientific data (surveys, landings, and observers data) can also be valuable to help fishers to decide where and when to fish to best avoid unwanted catches and maximise opportunities to catch their quotas. We provide some examples of this type of approach, and also how these can be adapted for use as interactive online apps that fishers can use in planning or whilst at sea. © The Author(s) 2019.","Challenge trials; Decision support tools; Discard avoidance; Fine scale mapping; Fish distribution; Fishers; Fishing strategies; Hot-spot maps",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084104084

Efficient mitigation strategies (exemptions, quota uplifts, improved selectivity, effort reallocation and others) may, for some of the analysed fisheries, reduce the negative economic effect of the LO. Moreover, the possibility to trade quotas, both nationally and internationally, may also reduce the economic losses caused by the LO.

This can be done through component sharing, or sharing critical design principles. This alignment is not trivial, as extensive design knowledge is needed to overview a portfolio with many, often highly different products and manufacturing lines. In this paper, we suggest establishing a frame of reference for new-product introduction based on several ‘game rules’, or Business Critical Design Rules (BCDRs), which denote the most critical features of the product and manufacturing architectures, and should be considered an obligatory reference for design when introducing new architectures. BCDRs are derived from the portfolio, architecture and module levels, including modelling of the most critical links between the product and manufacturing domains. The suggested modelling principle has been tested as a frame for new-architecture introduction, capturing critical modularisation principles in a large and global OEM. Application of the suggested method revealed a potential for reducing time-to-market and potentially cutting 35% off investments in new manufacturing equipment when introducing new products in the portfolio. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","architecture introduction; cost improvement; design rules; new-product development; portfolio management; product platform","Architecture; Commerce; Concurrent engineering; Cutting equipment; Financial data processing; Investments; Product development; Cost improvements; Design rules; New product development; Portfolio managements; Product platforms; Product design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044478168

Overbooking is managed by inflating the physical capacity using a static overbooking model, followed by seat allocation (excluding overbooking) on the inflated capacity. This simplification, although not optimal, has been the practice since the birth of revenue management. In this paper, we solve the joint overbooking and seat allocation problem for fare families by invoking the Equivalence Charging Transformation of Subramanian et al. (Transp Sci 33(2):147–167, 1999) and the Marginal Revenue Transformation of Fiig et al. (J Revenue Pricing Manag 9(1):152–170, 2010). These transformations enable us to transform the high-dimensional dynamic programming (DP) model into an equivalent low-dimensional DP model that can readily be solved and implemented in existing RMS and inventory systems. We demonstrate that the DP model not only is able to incorporate factors that were previously ignored, such as the demand level, willingness to pay, and class-specific refund and cancellation rates, but importantly also provides significant revenue gains of 1 to 3 per cent at lower denied boarding levels compared with current industry practice. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","Dynamic programming (DP); Fare families; Overbooking; Revenue management systems (RMS); Seat allocation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049557650

In past work, simulations have found that DPEs can lead to revenue gains for airlines over traditional pricing and RM. However, these algorithms typically price each itinerary independently without directly considering the attributes and availability of other alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic pricing engine that simultaneously prices multiple substitutable itineraries that depart at different times. Using a Hotelling line (also called a locational choice model) to represent customer tradeoffs between departure times and price, the DPE dynamically suggests increments or decrements to the prices of pre-determined fare products as a function of booking request characteristics, departure time preferences, and the airline’s estimates of customer willingness-to-pay. Simulations in the Passenger Origin–Destination Simulator (PODS) show that simultaneous dynamic pricing can result in revenue gains of between 5 and 7% over traditional RM when used in a simple network with one airline and two flights. The heuristic produces revenue gains by stimulating new bookings, encouraging business passenger buy-up, and leading to spiral-up of forecast demand. However, simultaneous dynamic pricing produces marginal gains of less than 1% over a DPE that prices each itinerary independently. Given the complexity of specifying and implementing a simultaneous pricing model in practice, practitioners may prefer to use a flight-by-flight approach when developing DPEs. © 2018, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Airline revenue management; Dynamic pricing; Dynamic pricing engine; New Distribution Capability; Substitutable flights",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045280594

Today, however, offer creation is rudimentary, managed in separate processes, organizations, and IT systems. We believe the current approach is inadequate and that the key to profitability is to manage offers consistently in an integrated Offer Management System (OMS). However, realizing this vision, will require significant advancements in the science of pricing and in distribution. The entire scope of an OMS cannot be covered in a single paper. Hence, to provide depth, we will focus on what we believe is one of the most critical components of the OMS—Dynamic Pricing of airline offers.

Furthermore, the quantum relational process philosophy is tied to quantum storytelling. Whereas the quantum relational process philosophy outlines a philosophy of a processual ontology, epistemology, and ethic, quantum storyÂ¬telling provides the storytelling medium through which such an ontology, epistemology, and ethic emerges through articulation and actualization. As such, the two approaches are introduced as inseparable from each other. The focus of this chapter is to unfold the ties between the quantum relational process philosophy and quantum storytelling through the perspective of the quantum relational process philosophy itself. The proposed quantum relational process philosophy is defined as Being-in-Becoming. Thereby, this approach is suggested as an alternative to the ""'Beinga"" perspective and the ""Becominga"" perspective or at least as a further development of the becoming perspective. These latter two perspectives presÂ¬ent two different ways of viewing organizational change: development and transformation. The being perspective relies on substance ontology acknowledging the exisÂ¬tence of entities: that ""which is. a"" In substance ontology, however, entities such as individuals and organizations are viewed as existing in themselves in fixed space-time frames. This view entails a rather static and stable ontology, perceiving the organization as a ready-made world of stable, unchanging entiÂ¬ties. This perspective is often referred to as the approach of building the orgaÂ¬nizational world through intervention and control of change. As a contrast, the becoming perspective relies on a process ontology while the organization is perceived as a sea of constant flux and change through which the organization emerges on the way. In this process-oriented perspective, attention is directed toward ""that which is becoming. a"" In this perspective, the organization is perceived as a world-making phenomenon emerging through ceaseless processes of transformation. This approach is often referred to as the dwelling approach, that is, to dwell in the world-making phenomenon letting it happen. This perspective tends to ignore that which exists, that is the ready-made forms, and only focus on that which is becoming. In this chapter, the proposed being-in-becoming perspective views the tension between being and becoming as a dialectical interplay that is decisive to orgaÂ¬nizational transformation. However, in the being-in-becoming perspective, "" entitiesa"" are viewed from a quantum perspective whereby being-in-becoming differs from the substance ontology in its view of the nature of ""entities. a"" In this perspective, the organization is viewed as a dialectical interplay between, at the one hand, the organizational form(ing) of life and, at the other hand, the aliveness of unfolding and transforming living life-worlds of being-in-the-world in fluid space and open time. This dialectical interplay is conceived as central in organizational world-creating processes. The aim of the chapter is to develop a conceptual framework of a quantum relational process philosophy that embraces the dialectics of transforming orgaÂ¬nizations. The contribution is to be capable of understanding the performative consequences of dialectic to organizational transformation viewed from the being-in-becoming perspective of the quantum relational process philosophy. Through the contribution of Heidegger, Hegel, Aristotle, and Boje, and furÂ¬ther enriched by Barad, Bakhtin, and Shotter, a conceptual framework is developed for understanding, analyzing, and problematizing dialectical orgaÂ¬nizational world-creating. This framework is called ""Fourfold World-Creating. a"" The fourfold world-creating framework keeps the dialectic of organizational transformation at its center while it at the same time take into consideration the dialectical interÂ¬play of ontology, epistemology, and ethic. In this sense, the framework is proÂ¬posed as quantum relational process philosophy. The incorporation of ethic in the quantum relational process philosophy represents an additional contribuÂ¬tion of the chapter. The fourfold world-creating framework is furthermore suggested to be conÂ¬ceived as a quantum relational process philosophy of the antenarrative dimension in David Bojea's quantum storytelling triad framework encompassÂ¬ing: (1) the narrative, (2) the living stories, and (3) the antenarrative. In his recent research, David Boje has a developed a dialectical perspective on his storytelling framework. Following in line with this thinking, this chapter sugÂ¬gests viewing (1) the narrative as the ready-made form, (2) the living stories as the living life-worlds, and (3) the antenarrative as fourfold world-creating. In this sense, the proposed dialectical fourfold world-creating framework and its embeddedness in the quantum relational process philosophy contributes to our understanding of the research contributes of antenarrative storytelling in organizational studies. As findings, the chapter proposes what could be considered as ontological, epistemological, and ethical key constituents in dialectical organizational world-creating. The contribution of these findings encompasses an analytical framework for (1) understanding the dialectical, transformative movements ofthe organization as well as (2) analyzing and problematizing the cease of dialectical tensions that seems to lock the organization in a particular state of being, only capable of repeating and reproducing its ready-made world in fixed space-time frames. © 2019 Emerald Publishing Limited.

Second, the purpose is to construct a storytelling approach for the configuration of such spaces. Design/methodology/approach: The paper’s conceptual purpose is achieved through a theoretical discussion of three concepts: performance, politics and storytelling. Findings: Learning in HE needs reconsideration in terms of what kinds of learning are made possible through the discursive and material configuration of the spaces of research and teaching. In particular, the focus to some extent should move away from the management and control of learning toward what enables learning. Practical implications: The literature on organizational learning and the learning organization comprise concepts, methods and tools that play different roles with regard to controlling, shaping and enabling learning. When the focus is on learning in HE, it is important to be aware of the tracks of learning these technologies enable. Social implications: The interest in managing and controlling learning is often problematic in relation to the potential of HE to produce new and innovative forms of learning. Originality/value: This paper introduces the term “spaces of performance,” which directs attention toward the material, discursive and relational conditions for learning.

The heuristic was tested on 264 benchmark instances containing up to 11,640 nodes, 12,675 edges, 8581 required edges, and 323 vehicles. FastCARP was compared with an alternative heuristic called Base and with several Path-Scanning algorithms. On small graphs, it was better but slower than Base. On larger graphs, it was much faster and only slightly worse than Base in terms of solution quality. It also outperforms the Path-Scanning algorithms. © 2018, © Operational Research Society 2018.","Arc routing; Denmark; districts; heuristics; waste collection","Benchmarking; Iterative methods; Network routing; Arc routing; Denmark; districts; heuristics; Waste collection; Heuristic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049054018

The incubator and investment firm has pioneered an extreme approach to new venture creation that is often referred to as a “startup factory:” it rapidly assembles and scales new companies, replicating business models that have been developed elsewhere. Separating the ideation of business models from their execution allows Rocket Internet to specialize on the latter, because it eliminates the need to create an environment that is conducive to both processes. Yet specialization may also be Rocket Internet’s largest liability, because it makes the firm dependent on the availability of appropriate (co-specialized) business models.

In the paper, we argue that designing organizations should be scientific-based and forward-looking. This raises challenges in designing organizations in contexts and situations that are new and have not been seen before. Experimentation of what is and what might be is the basis for exploring and examining what makes a good science for organizational design. Experimentation permits us to examine what might be for organization designs, which are not well understood or may not exist yet. Collaborative communities, new ventures, agile organizations, and temporary organizations are examples; experimentation permits us explore and examine what is and what might be and to examine the organizational design problem and perform experiments to understand the relationship between structure and coordination mechanisms of information, communications, decisions, trust, and incentives—the basis for the multi-contingency theory of organizational design. An organizational design must specify the fit between the structure of division of tasks in the organization with its coordination, or how to make these tasks work in concert. These tasks can be interdependent and uncertain. To design good organizations, we need empirical evidence about what is and exploration about what might be; we need a good theoretical basis for being able to generalize our knowledge. To illustrate our point, we examine two experiments on the classic M-form hypothesis—a computer simulation that examines coordination, organization structure, and interdependency and a laboratory experiment that examines the effect of incentives on opportunism and performance. Together, we find that the M-form is a robust organizational design, but with contingent conditions. Finally, we discuss how observation and experimentation together is the foundation for the development of scientific-based theory of organizational design. © 2018, The Author(s).","Collaborative Community; Coordination Mechanisms; Design Rules; Opportunity Loss; Organizational Design Problem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063463289

However, it appears not to deter Chinese firms as evidenced by their risky internationalization pattern. This study is concerned with explaining this phenomenon. Drawing on organizational learning and institutional theories, I argue that institutional heterogeneity in China gives firms an opportunity to develop routines to overcome the liability of foreignness through acquisition experience gained outside of their home provinces. Further, I propose that coastal and inland firms draw different routines from their acquisition experiences. I test these arguments on panel data of listed Chinese firms, tracing their acquisition behavior from 2006 to 2015. My analyses suggest that acquisition experience outside of home province matters and that, in the case of inland firms, coastal acquisition experience facilitates subsequent internationalization. The present study contributes to the literature on the internationalization of Chinese firms. It highlights the value of context-specific measures for Chinese management research, sheds light on the functionality of institutional heterogeneity in China, and provides evidence to re-evaluate the riskiness of Chinese firms' internationalization pattern. © 2018 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.","Acquisitions; China; institutional heterogeneity; internationalization; liability of foreignness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061790892

This introduction reviews this approach to integrating history into organization studies and explores its paths forward. We begin by examining the intellectual origins of the approach and by defining why and how it matters to the study of management and organizations. Specifically, we emphasize the performative role of history in making and unmaking organizational orders. Next, we elaborate on how the articles in the special issue demonstrate the uses of the past in shaping organizational identity, strategy, and power. We also highlight how this work contributes to our understanding of the socially embedded character of history in organizations by accounting for the role of materiality, intertextuality, competing narratives, practices, and audiences in how the past is used. We conclude by considering four research frontiers particularly worthy of further exploration—the influence of temporal form, the role of non-rational knowledge, the range of methods, and the integration of ethics—in studies of the uses of the past in organizations. © The Author(s) 2018.","historical consciousness; history; rhetorical history; social memory; temporality; uses of the past",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058122565

So far, scholars have largely focused the level of analysis on the organization, without exploring the intertwined nature of historical claim-making with the organizational field or society at large. This article extends the status quo by conceptualizing the role of context for organizational uses-of-the-past. It identifies three key aspects of context that shape how history contributes to the social construction of reality: the existence of multiple audiences, the landscape of pre-existing historical narratives and the experience of social practices giving credibility to historical claims. By analysing the historical case of German business in colonial India, the paper makes three broader claims that could move research toward a more contextualized conception of the uses-of-the-past: (i) historical claims are validated in a continuous dialogue with multiple audiences; (ii) they revise previously existing narratives by critiquing or ‘outpasting’, i.e. invoking earlier origins; (iii) they often result in ‘rhetorical frictions’ that require continuous and skilful history revisions to mitigate emerging conflicts in their reception. By contextualizing the uses-of-the-past in this way, the paper moves beyond ‘hypermuscular’ organizational actors bending history to their will and foregrounds the situated nature of historical rhetoric. © The Author(s) 2018.","context; historical methods; history; rhetorical history",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058087255

The paper discusses three related elements and their inter-relationship in the brokerage process: the enabling factors for brokerage in business networks; the brokerage activities, particularly the combination of “bonding”, “bridging”, exclusion, and moderation/negotiation in different network configurations; and the outcomes of brokerage for business networks. We argue that network managers should take care of these elements when using brokerage to govern business networks. For example, the positional factors of agents in the network who take over brokerage functions need to be monitored and a balance of their embeddedness in the network and independence of focal firms should be safeguarded. Moreover, activities associated with brokerage should be steered and controlled in order to generate network benefits such as a higher collaborative stance of the partaking firms or learning processes amongst them. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Brokerage; Brokers; Inter-firm business networks; Metasynthesis; Network governance; Structural holes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057056486

A direct link between attitudes (tax morale) and behavior (tax compliance) has long been assumed, despite an extensive social scientific literature attesting to the generally weak congruence between the two. This study builds on an emerging body of work questioning the link between tax morale and compliance. It innovates with a cross-national experimental research design whose results indicate that populations with high levels of tax morale exhibit higher evasion rates than those with low levels of tax morale; thus, the study finds that individual self-reported tax morale cannot predict actual evasion choices. Methodologically, the paper contributes the first results of a laboratory experiment on taxation in Denmark, comparing them to laboratory findings from Italy; while previous research indicates that these two countries lie at opposite extremes in tax compliance and morale, our findings run contrary to “culturalist” explanations.

Previous studies have shown that dengue vector mosquitoes are weather sensitive, and the effect of temperature on dengue transmission has been confirmed. However, associations between rainfall events and dengue incidence are not consistent, and few studies have addressed the roles of the magnitude and frequency of rainfall events in dengue transmission. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to differentiate the long-term and short-term effects of rainfall variation on dengue transmission and to investigate these effects within different socio-ecological contexts in southern Taiwan, which is a high-epidemic tropical region. A negative binomial multilevel model with Gaussian serial correlation was used in this study to investigate the intra- and inter-annual rainfall variability to determine the effects of rainfall on dengue occurrence in the pre-epidemic and epidemic seasons. Our significant results indicate that short-term rainfall and dengue occurrence show a non-linear relationship in which medium rainfall during the dengue season poses the most significant risk. We also found that rainfall effects are interactive to the percentage of old houses. Our results show strong synergistic interactions between low rain frequency and old house percentage, and between cumulative rainfall and old house percentage, contributing to dengue outbreaks. Our findings also differentiate the effects of short-term and long-term rainfall in old built-up environments on dengue occurrence. This implies that during rainy periods, old neighborhoods may require more attention from the public and private sectors to improve environmental quality and promote resident health. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Built environment; Dengue; Multilevel model; Rainfall; Taiwan","dengue fever; disease transmission; disease vector; modeling; mosquito; public health; rainfall; urban area; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055676731

Despite increasing societal interest in transitions to more sustainable transportation technologies, there has been little consideration of how such innovations might challenge, maintain or support different aspects of automobility, and what that means for technology deployment, transport policy, and user practices. To bring attention to the complexity and apparent durability of the automobility system, in this paper we develop a conceptual framework that explores automobility through a categorization of frames, or shared cultural meanings. This framework moves beyond the typical focus on private, functional considerations of user choice, financial costs and time use to also consider symbolic and societal frames of automobility that exist among users, non-users, industry, policymakers and other relevant social groups. We illustrate this framework with eight particular frames of automobility that fall into four broad categories: private-functional frames such as (1) cocooning and fortressing and (2) mobile digital offices; private-symbolic frames such as (3) gender identity and (4) social status; societal-functional frames such as (5) environmental stewardship and (6) suburbanization; and societal-symbolic frames such as (7) self-sufficiency and (8) innovativeness. Finally, we start the process of discussing several transportation innovations in light of these automobility frames, namely electrified, autonomous and shared mobility—examining early evidence for which frames would be challenged or supported by such transitions. We believe that appreciation of the complex and varied frames of automobility can enrich discussion of transitions and policy relating to sustainable transportation. © 2018 The Authors","Automobility; Autonomous vehicles; Electric vehicles; Frames; Mobility; Shared mobility","Autonomous vehicles; Carrier mobility; Electric vehicles; Sustainable development; Automobility; Conceptual frameworks; Environmental stewardship; Frames; Relevant social groups; Sustainability transition; Sustainable transportation; Technology deployment; Automobile frames; electric vehicle; innovation; mobility; sustainability; transportation policy; transportation technology; travel behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055290779

However, this decision places them in a rich versus king dilemma. If they choose to implement such mechanisms and secure the king position, they risk losing money at IPO. If they choose not to implement control-enhancing mechanisms and adopt the rich position they risk losing control over the firm. We investigate theoretically and empirically the outcomes of this dilemma in a multi-period setting (at IPO and post-IPO). We found that the majority of founder-CEOs who choose the king option recover initial wealth loss, and hence, they can reconcile the rich and king paths in the long-run post-IPO. Managerial Summary: Founder-CEOs often use control-enhancing mechanisms (CEMs), such dual class shares, pyramid control structures, and pact agreements, to maintain control over their IPO firms. In this study, we investigate the effects of these CEMs on firm value at IPO and post-IPO using a unique hand-collected dataset comprising all founder-CEO led firms that went public on French regulated markets between January 1992 and December 2010. We found that most founder-CEOs who use multiple CEMs leave considerable amounts of money on the table at IPO date but they are able to recover their initial loss 5 years post-IPO. This result suggests that an IPO may constitute a valuable financing alternative even for founder-CEOs who value control. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","anti-takeover mechanisms; founder-CEOs; IPOs; ownership structure; principal-principal agency cost","Planning; Control structure; founder-CEOs; Initial loss; IPOs; Loss of control; Multi-period; Ownership structure; Principal agencies; Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055260591

It further complements this typology by developing a more objective, empirically derived taxonomy of plant role and accordingly proposes four new plant roles, i.e. Star Plant, Old School Plant, Expert Plant, and Replaceable Plant. These plant roles are different in terms of location advantages and site competences, as well as other characteristics, e.g. product, process, market, and location. Second, this paper extends our understandings on plant role by exploring the fit of a plant role with the differentiation of its management practices based on the developed taxonomy. It identifies three patterns regarding the fits between plant roles and their management practices and implies that plants that are strongly embedded in the manufacturing network are expected to play the high level of strategic role; plants with greater responsibility may sometimes correspond with less autonomy; plants in dilemma might have more motivation to coordinate with other plants and integrate with external customers; and plants managed in old styles might be more independent and thereby passive about coordination and integration with other partners. These results highlight that management practices need to be differentiated so that plants can pursue their roles effectively. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Extension; Manufacturing network; Plant role; Revisit","Location; Taxonomies; Extension; External customers; Management practices; Manufacturing networks; Plant role; Revisit; Strategic role; Two-dimension; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054007525

To guide environmental sustainability efforts in the industry, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been recognized as an important tool by researchers and policy makers. But to what extent has the LCA methodology been present in companies' narratives through their CS reports up to now? To answer this question, we map references to the LCA methodology in CS reports over the past two decades at geographical, sectoral, and company levels through keyword searching within an extensive database (~45,000 CS reports), analyze trends, and highlight challenges, opportunities, and recommendations to strengthen the presence of LCA in CS reports. The results show that LCA generally remains weakly present in CS reporting, with some geographical and sectoral variations.

The model implies that dynamic aggregate agency costs are driven by firms in the upper half of the distribution of private benefits. Managers of those firms capture 0.8% of firms' net income on average, thereby decreasing aggregate firm value by 1.7%. These agency costs are procyclical (1.9% in booms and 1.4% in recessions) because managerial underleverage decreases default costs particularly in recessions.

A day-based anchored cross-validation experimental protocol is also provided that can be used as a benchmark for comparing the performance of state-of-the-art methodologies. Performance of baseline approaches are also provided to facilitate experimental comparisons. We expect that such a large-scale dataset can serve as a testbed for devising novel solutions of expert systems for high-frequency limit order book data analysis. © 2018 The Authors Journal of Forecasting Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","high-frequency trading; limit order book; machine learning; mid-price; ridge regression; single hidden feedforward neural network","Benchmarking; Commerce; Electronic trading; Expert systems; Feedforward neural networks; Financial markets; Forecasting; Large dataset; Learning systems; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Time series; Data representations; Experimental comparison; Experimental protocols; High-frequency trading; Limit order book; Machine learning methods; mid-price; Ridge regression; Correlation theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052636067

To this end the industry sector, characterised by a high share of emissions and an intense and diversified energy demand, holds a paramount role. In the framework of assessing the transformation of the industry sector towards more sustainable alternatives, due to interdependencies within an energy system, the adoption of measures to reduce fossil fuel use in industry (e.g. efficiency, fuel substitution, electrification and energy cascading) can influence the operation and transformation of the energy system. To this end, the study proposes a method to simulate and optimise operational aspects of the industry sector at high level of details. The conceptual model is then integrated in an established bottom-up energy system model, creating a benchmark for analyses that can focus simultaneously on the impact of changes in the industry and in the energy sector on a system wide scale. On the practical side, by mean of a Danish case study, the paper sheds light on particular characteristics of the industry sectors, focusing on the structure of industrial energy use in regards to end-use processes, aspects of energy consumption, and measures for fossil fuel reduction. Considerations sparking from the analysis show the potential applicability of energy cascading, electrification and fuel substitution for industrial processes, engaging elements and technologies interlinked within the energy system. Given the theoretical approach proposed, similar considerations can be investigated for other case studies, exploiting the simultaneous optimisation of power, district heat, industry dispatches and characteristics. In this framework, the transformation of the energy use in industry sector can be simulated according to more stringent policies capping CO2 emission levels and specific support schemes, paving the way for carbon neutral societies and a more sustainable, yet resilient, future energy system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Electrification; Energy savings; Fuel substitution; Industry modelling; Integrated energy system model Balmorel; Process heat","Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Fossil fuels; Electrification; Fuel substitution; Industrial energy use; Industrial processs; Integrated energy systems; Operational aspects; Process heat; Theoretical approach; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052613996

In this article, we introduce a set of studies of changes, typically employer-driven, in collective wage regulation in northern Europe. We discuss possible drivers of change: contagion from southern Europe, regime competition among the northern countries themselves and/or destabilizing effects of east–north integration, driven by free movement. These drivers interact with internal change dynamics spurring diverging actor responses and institutional outcomes. We outline the common research design, review salient features of wage regulation in six countries, and differences in institutions, production, markets and factor mobility in four sectors.

We study the problem in a two-period setting with persistent types and investigate how the optimal rationing and slack depend on whether production increases or decreases over time. We find that rationing in a dynamic model with persistent types is extra costly, since the types that are eliminated in period 1 might have been attractive in period 2. The cost of rationing increases with the variability of production. If production levels are increasing (decreasing), the principal will be cautious when eliminating types with low variable (fixed) costs in period 1, since these types are particularly profitable in period 2. When production is more stable over time, harsher rationing can be applied in period 1, followed by less harsh rationing, if any, in period 2. © University of Chicago on behalf of the Accounting Research Center, 2018","C72; C76; contracting; cost accounting; cost functions; D21; dynamic model; fixed and variable costs; L24; M41; managerial accounting; organizational slack; production contracting; production management; resource rationing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052406398

Finding the optimum of this problem, also known in statistical mechanics as the Cheeger constant, is one of the most interesting NP-hard network optimisation problems. The existence of low conductance minima indicates bottlenecks in complex networks. However, the problem has not yet been explored in depth in the context of applied discrete optimisation and evolutionary approaches to solve it. In this paper, the use of a memetic framework is explored to solve the minimum conductance problem. The approach combines a hybrid method of initial population generation based on bridge identification and local optima sampling with a steady-state evolutionary process with two local search subroutines. These two local search subroutines have complementary qualities. Efficiency of three crossover operators is explored, namely one-point crossover, uniform crossover, and our own partition crossover. Experimental results are presented for both artificial and real-world complex networks. Results for Barabási–Albert model of scale-free networks are presented, as well as results for samples of social networks and protein–protein interaction networks. These indicate that both well-informed initial population generation and the use of a crossover seem beneficial in solving the problem in large-scale. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Bottlenecks; Cheeger constant; Complex networks; Memetic algorithms; Minimum conductance problem; Sparsest cut",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045852537

However, informality of creative work has been so far treated dualistically: firstly, as the informal governance of creative labour markets and secondly, as the ever-increasing informalization of creative workplaces. In contrast, this article argues for the importance of focusing on informal labour practices as infused in relational contexts so as to understand how creative workers uphold career sustainability and cope daily with contingent, insecure and underpaid work. Drawing on the relational work perspective from economic sociology, I contend that creative workers’ informal labour practices and economic activities are constituted by the meanings and quality workers attach to interpersonal relations. The more socially and spatially intimate and closer the interpersonal relationship, the less the economic benefit. The more socially and spatially distant the relationship, the greater the pecuniary motivation. The article maps relational work dynamics in: (1) informal paid labour practices, comprising work under-the-radar of state authorities, such as cash-in-hand work including online crowd-work, tips-based work, and paid favours and (2) informal unpaid labour practices, practices happening in webs of reciprocity that are not directly compensated with money, such as barter, favour-swapping and voluntary work. © The Author(s) 2018.","creative industries; creative labour; creative work; economies of favour; informal labour practices; informal work; informality; post-socialist work; precarity; relational work","article; career; drawing; human; human experiment; human relation; market; money; motivation; sociology; telecommunication; worker; workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044772801

This research has improved our understanding of the M&A IS challenges and their solutions. However, consolidation and integration across the research is limited. To redress this omission, we review 70 articles published between 1989 and 2016. To do this, we adopt and extend the methodology developed by Lacity and her colleagues to review the empirical evidence in a fragmented IT literature. We code 53 dependent variables and 195 independent variables to identify the robust relationships among them and to model how ISI decisions, including the choice of IS integration methods, partially mediate the effects of the independent variables on ISI outcomes. Examining the relationships in this model, we identify five quasi-independent thematic domains on which we draw to develop an agenda for future research. Our contribution is the aggregation, organization and structuring of the empirical findings in the M&A ISI literature as a basis on which to develop a cumulative knowledge process. © 2018, Association for Information Technology Trust.","acquisition; information systems; integration; literature review; merger","Information systems; Information use; Integration; acquisition; Dependent variables; Empirical findings; Independent variables; Information system integration; Literature reviews; merger; Role of Information Systems; Mergers and acquisitions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042566983

Drawing on a survey of 362 Danish SMEs, we address four partner proximity characteristics: geographic, cognitive, organizational, and social. The results show that SMEs prioritize geographic openness over regional clustering. Furthermore, to simultaneously facilitate collaboration and ensure innovation, firms tend to collaborate with partners that are characterized by cognitive similarity at a technological level and knowledge distance at a market level. Technological proximity is also found to be more relevant than social proximity when it comes to bridging the potential geographic and market distance between the collaborative partners. Finally, the results indicate that the tendency of organizational proximity to facilitate informal interactions with partners enhances process innovation only at two of four process innovation levels. Thus, the results highlight the fact that the value of partner proximity characteristics change with the level of process innovation considered. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Partner collaboration; Process innovation; Proximity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038351553

In practical terms, this means that innovation and its implementation tend to become the sole responsibility of a few people rather than becoming part of the everyday pulse of life that runs throughout an organization. As we transition from an industrial society to a global knowledge and innovation economy, we need new breed of leaders and a new understanding of leadership. Jon-Arild Johannessen and Hanne Stokvik delve into the necessary conditions for this new type of leadership, which they call ""innovation leadership,"" and develop a holistic model that includes entrepreneurial action, innovative leadership, creative energy fields within organizations, high-tech wealth creation, and innovation as a business process. Their step-by-step explanations include 50 reader reflection tasks, case letters, and business cases. All of these are predicated upon the principles process-pedagogy, a mode of teaching and learning that encourages readers to collaborate with their peers in order to develop their innovative thinking and communication skills. What this means is that readers of this book not only come to understand innovation leadership but train to become innovation leaders, themselves. For its cutting-edge ideas, its clearly structured chapters, and its proactive approach to encouraging readers to implement their learning, Evidence-Based Innovation Leadership is essential reading for researchers, students, practitioners, and anyone else eager to become a better innovation leader in today's knowledge economy. © 2019 Emerald Publishing Limited.

We focus on the directors who are not elected by the employees and test three hypotheses on female board representation that we denote the female-led hypothesis, the tokenism hypothesis, and the pipeline hypothesis, respectively. We find evidence rejecting the female-led hypothesis. Firms with a female chairperson on the board of directors tend to have significantly fewer other non-employee-elected female board members. We also find clear evidence of a tokenism behavior in Danish companies. The likelihood of enlarging the share of non-employee-elected female board members is significantly smaller if one, two, or more women have sat on the board of directors. Finally, the pipeline hypothesis is partly confirmed. The relation between the female pipeline of potentially qualified directors and female directors is weaker than the similar relation for males. Our findings offer insights to policy makers interested in promoting gender diversity within boardrooms. Our empirical evidence suggests that an important way to increase the female proportion of non-employee-elected board members is that more women reach top executive positions. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Corporate governance; Femaleled companies; Gender gap; Pipeline hypothesis; Tokenism hypothesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948965853

While a substantial literature on African SMEs has emerged in recent years, studies of their performance specifically are few and inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to address this lacuna in the literature by examining variations in performance of 210 East African SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs OLS and logistic regression and Classify k-means test to analyze performance variations in a unique data set of 210 food processing enterprises in Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia. Findings: Three generic types of African SMEs are identified based on performance: laggards, followers and gazelles. The gazelles are typically medium-sized, skill-intensive companies selling relatively differentiated products in niche markets. The laggards are typically small, capital-intensive companies involved in grain milling that adopt a cost differentiation strategy. A key driver of variation in performance is found to be the quality of the external business environment (in particular the quality of intermediary markets), and also capability factors such as the strength of management. Strategy factors such as differentiation and political strategies explain performance variations. Practical implications: Among the policy implications are that African industrial policy should focus on improving the functioning of intermediary markets, e.g. by reducing the transaction costs of inter-firm collaboration. Moreover, rather than focusing industrial policy on SMEs per se, policymakers should focus on those types of enterprises that are capable of generating high performance, e.g. skill-intensive enterprises with strong managerial capabilities, engaged in differentiation strategies. Originality/value: The paper integrates the extant literature on African SME performance, develops an analytical framework for studying it and presents novel empirical insights based on one of the most detailed surveys of SME performance in the continent to date. The findings have important and tangible implications for literature, as well as for industrial policy. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","African enterprise strategy; Determinants of SME performance; Food processing industry; Industrial development policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057550306

The purpose of this paper is to examine the validity of such a decompression zone account in actual field settings, and hence investigate whether or not placing products at the store entrance would increase customers’ likelihood to purchase these products. Design/methodology/approach: Two field studies with a total sample of 715 customers were conducted, in which the entrance area of a home goods store was manipulated using a two-group quasi-experimental design. In Study 1, customers were (vs were not) exposed to candles and candle holders at the store entrance. In Study 2, an employee greeted customers at the store entrance with (vs without) the store’s products nearby. Findings: Study 1 found that customers who were (vs were not) exposed to candles and candle holders at the store entrance purchased a significantly larger number of both these products. Study 2 replicated and generalized these findings. Although customers in the employee + products condition spent less money than customers in the employee-alone condition, the former group still purchased a significantly larger number of candles and candle holders. These findings go directly against a decompression zone account, but are consistent with research on exposure effects. Originality/value: This paper is the first to empirically examine the validity of the decompression zone account in real retail settings. The paper also fills a more general gap in the store atmospherics literature, as only a very limited number of studies have dealt with the external parts of the retail environment, such as the store entrance area. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Atmospherics; Decompression zone; Exposure effects; External variables; Field study; Store entrance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056194742

We empirically investigated potential success factors for crowdfunding projects of entrepreneurs on the base of 430 projects from the German crowdfunding platform Visionbakery. Our results show that social interaction during a crowdfunding campaign indeed increases the likelihood of its success. As comments from crowd members on particular projects might be positive or negative and can also provide additional argumentation or raise questions, comments can cause a dialog among crowd members.

Entrepreneurs at the base of the pyramid (BoP) face an additional challenge: the context in which they operate is also lacking in resources, at least strategic resources that contribute competitive advantage. Nevertheless, firms in a BoP context are urged to become socially embedded and build on the present resources and conditions. This implies a resource mobilization process and joint value creation. Using a single case study of an electricity firm operating in rural India, this research investigates how entrepreneurs can mobilize strategic, ordinary, and weak resources through social embeddedness at the BoP. The research discloses three new actions related to become socially embedded–enticing customers, selective attention, and supplier responsiveness. It thus contributes theoretically to the social embeddedness perspective and the BoP literature. Moreover, it contributes theoretically to the resource-based view (RBV) theory and the resource mobilization perspective in suggesting that there is more room to socially embed ordinary and weak resources. As a result, they become more valuable compared to strategic resources, which exhibit less room for becoming socially embedded and therefore become less valuable. Consequently, the findings challenge the RBV and the valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN) labeling of resources. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","base of the pyramid; entrepreneur; ordinary and weak resources; resource mobilization; resource-based view; social embeddedness; Strategic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021663315

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses second-order structural equation modeling to analyze survey data from 368 different lean manufacturing facilities. Findings: The paper finds that the complementary effects of management control mechanisms in lean manufacturing firms outweigh their additive effects on firm performance. Research limitations/implications: Applying isolated lean management control mechanisms leads to inferior performance, as these management control mechanisms are complementary. Thus, to realize the full potential of lean manufacturing, this paper suggests that lean management control mechanisms should be implemented as an integrated control system. Practical implications: Firms seeking to benefit from the implementation of lean manufacturing should understand the complementarity among the management control mechanisms, as the performance effects of lean management control mechanisms when applied together are greater than their isolated additive effects.

Design/methodology/approach: A total of 243 supply chain managers with hiring experience participated in an adaptive choice-based conjoint experiment to uncover the relative importance of six competency attributes, namely, analytical and problem-solving ability, interpersonal skills, general management skills, computer/IT skills, supply chain management (SCM) knowledge and industry experience. Findings: SCM knowledge and analytical and problem-solving ability were identified as the most important competencies and were considered three times more important than general management skills. Based on convergent cluster and ensemble analysis, two types of hiring managers were identified. The first group is characterized by a pronounced preference for job candidates with extensive SCM knowledge. In contrast, the second group’s members prefer candidates with a more balanced competency profile.

Companies have been aware of the need to adopt resilience strategies in supply chain management. Therefore, considering resilience factors in the process of assessing and classifying suppliers (ordinal classification or sorting) is relevant. Supplier classification for further selection is a multiple criteria decision problem, which involves several criteria. In this paper, we adopt the ELECTRE TRI-nC method, which allows us to classify the suppliers taking into account multiple criteria and the decision makers’ preferences, including resilience criteria. The method was applied to classify the suppliers of a manufacturing industry from an emerging economy (India). A sorting model was collaboratively constructed through an interaction process between the analysts and the decision makers (industrial managers). The proposed approach contributes to the decision process of selecting suppliers by providing a pre-classification of a set of suppliers into three different categories of overall performance. The results show that the proposed method is suitable and useful as a decision aiding tool for purchasing decisions, allowing managers to obtain robust conclusions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","BRIC countries; ELECTRE TRI-nC; Emerging economies; Multiple criteria decision aiding; Resilient supply chain; Supplier classification","Decision making; Decision support systems; Managers; Supply chain management; BRIC countries; ELECTRE TRI; Emerging economies; Manufacturing industries; Multiple Criteria Decision Aiding; Multiple-criteria decisions; Ordinal classification; Purchasing decisions; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051680797

In this paper, the author examines the extended pre-implementation phase prior to the introduction of the largest-ever health IT (HIT) implementation in Denmark. The purpose of this paper is to expand the conceptualization of organizational change to include the neglected pre-implementation phase preceding large-scale organizational change projects. Design/methodology/approach: The research is based on qualitative data consisting of interviews, documents and observations gathered during a three-year research project in the Danish health sector. An important source of methodical inspiration has been grounded theory, which has allowed the pertinent interview themes to evolve and allowed for the gradual development of a theoretical framework. Findings: The main finding of this paper is that the anticipatory pre-implementation phase is not simply passive waiting time for organizational members. Evidence from a three-year research project demonstrates how organizational members engage in recurring patterns of sensemaking, positioning and scripting of possible futures in preparation for the organizational changes that next generation HIT imposes. The study argues that resistance to organizational change may be better understood as resistance to having to give up institutionalized rights and responsibilities. Originality/value: The paper offers a conceptual model—the anticipation cycle—that enables the systematic analysis of the relational mechanisms at work when organizational members are preparing for pending organizational change. Early analysis based on the anticipation cycle enables organizations and scholars to bring previously black-boxed anticipatory patterns into the equation of organizational change. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Anticipation; Healthcare; Organizational change; Positioning; Sensemaking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049567530

According to this theory, it is the way that resources interact with each other that results in such advantages. Resource integration, i.e. the alignment, or fit between resources, is one important outcome of resource orchestration processes. This paper aims to develop a scale and outline approaches to measuring such resource integration. Design/methodology/approach: Using a typology of five types of resources derived from value theory, the authors develop a scale for measuring the fit between resource types, i.e. the degree of resource integration. The authors illustrate the method using a case example of an IT company and demonstrate how a variety of statistical methods including hierarchical cluster analysis, structural equation modeling, social network analysis and methods from biostatistics can provide measures of resource integration. Findings: The authors develop a scale and associated measures that can help scholars systematically measure and identify firms with a high or low level of resource integration capability. This makes it possible to investigate further these companies and reconstruct how they support dynamic capabilities, as well as commonalities across firms with high and low levels of this capability. Originality/value: Existing studies on resource orchestration have failed to provide us with a reliable measurement instrument that can be used both in cross-sectional work, and in repeated or time-series studies, allowing us to assess the degree to which a wider range of resources in an organization are integrated.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper compares the performance measurement and benchmarking theory with current practice and data from different work environments. The paper builds on two books on adding value through buildings, facilities and services, both edited and co-authored by the authors of this paper. The books were based on literature reviews, interviews with practitioners, cross-border studies of performance measurement and benchmarking and in-depth analyses of various value parameters by experts from different countries. In addition, theory and empirical examples of benchmarking have been included. Findings: The paper presents 12 value parameters that are seen as relevant in measuring and benchmarking of workplace performance: four people-oriented, four business processes-related, two economic and two social parameters. Because not all values can be easily expressed in monetary units, various other ways of measuring are presented that can help to monitor and to benchmark workplace performance. The 12 values and ways to measure can be used to support a more integrated business case approach that goes beyond “dollar-metrics” and spreadsheet-based decision-making. Both quantitative and qualitative performance indicators, including hard and soft factors, are needed to define the trade-off between the costs and benefits of interventions in corporate real estate, facilities and services and to cope with the interests and needs of different stakeholders. Practical implications: To add value to an organisation, workplaces have to provide value for money by a positive trade-off between the benefits, i.e. support of the organisational objectives and the primary processes and the costs, time and risks connected with achieving these benefits. Widely used indicators to measure the costs are the investment costs, running costs and total cost of occupancy. These metrics are primarily connected to efficiency, i.e. to optimal use of the resources of a firm, but much less to effectiveness and benefits such as user satisfaction, productivity, health and well-being. Originality/value: The paper links performance measurement and benchmarking to value-adding corporate real estate and facilities management and presents new ways to measure and benchmark the performance of buildings, facilities and services in connection to organisational performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Added value; Benchmarking; Business case; KPIs; Performance measurement; Workplace",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054852301

This chapter analyses the position of contract from a modern contract law theory reflecting on the evolution of contract law theory and the understanding of contract as a social concept. CSR in this chapter is represented by a set of values and thus it is analysed to what extent values have been an element of contracts. Ultimately, this chapter analyses the position of European legal frameworks, the CESL, the PECL and the DCFR. The chapter carries out an inquiry into the state of the European common contract law frameworks and their embracement and inclusion of values.

This article focuses on the debate in the city council of Aarhus concerning women-only swimming activities that had existed for 10 years and had been well attended. Yet, after a year of discussion, the city council voted for a municipality-wide ban on women-only swimming during public opening hours. The popularity and longevity of the sessions pose the question: Why and how has women-only swimming become a ‘problem’, in other words a leisure time physical activity that challenges current discourses on immigration and integration? The debate on women-only swimming is an interesting case to study as it testifies not only to an increasing focus on the civic integration of ethnic minorities, including their leisure practices, but also to strong resistance by the general public and the women affected. Drawing on a postcolonial feminist perspective, our analysis shows how perceptions of Danishness, gender equality and non-religious leisure become central arguments in the debate, pointing to various ways in which understandings of gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion and nation intersect in the current restrictive politics of belonging. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ethnicity; Gender; integration; physical activity; religion","ethnicity; feminism; gender role; Islamism; perception; physical activity; swimming; womens status; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050567689

We argue that economic value is a blunt measure, and there are other types of value, positive and negative, that are also generated. This research reveals that a range of local conditions and structural characteristics create barriers and opportunities for generating different types of value. Using a case study of shore excursions in Copenhagen, the Baltic’s most important port, this paper explains the dynamics between cruise tourism and shore excursions. The study highlights that destination managers and port authorities cannot assume the monetary and non-monetary value generated from shore excursions automatically flows on to, and throughout, destinations.

Educational differences may trigger psychological responses such as negative social categorization and serve as an observable criterion by which professional status and power are allocated. Using a field experiment, schools were provided two types of new hires: those who shared the educational background of existing teams and more socially distinctive newcomers. Both types of newcomers led to heightened team reflection processes relative to a control group.

The exploratory application of social network analysis (SNA) is used to uncover the complexity of the networks in the trade in products and services in the local small-scale palm-oil sector, which exist parallel to a more formal large-scale sector. As a result, distinct local patterns of economic organisation are identified, indicating that SNA is a valuable tool for uncovering the territorial complexities of economic networks that other research methodologies may fail to capture. Hence, SNA is also an important and novel methodology for policy-making aimed at supporting and regulating an increasingly commercial agricultural economy in rural Africa. © 2018","Ghana; Global value chains; Oil palm; Small-scale industries; Social network analysis","economic activity; global trade; rural area; small scale industry; social network; territorial management; trade flow; vegetable oil; Ghana; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055266055

Therefore, it is relevant to add to the many conceptual contributions on the subject to explore how such systems unfold and develop in practice. The objective of the present study is to investigate how forces located outside focal firm boundaries influence the evolution of performance measurement systems in supply chains. An evolutionary and dialectic approach is applied, acknowledging that change may be the result of collective action and of opposing influences and forces. Using a longitudinal case study approach, the emergence, proliferation and reconfiguration of three varied yet interrelated performance measurement systems designed to manage a supply chain in the hearing aid industry are explored. The case shows how the evolution of performance measurement systems in supply chains may be informed by multiple influences, some of which are external to the firm. Specifically, ‘interconnectivity of performance measures’ ‘availability and ownership of performance information’ and ‘performance representations’ are all found to be important factors influencing the evolution of the observed performance measurement systems. The framework of the proposed factors here builds on and extends previous research, which has not explicitly incorporated the potential influences of external entities and the supply chain context. Thus, the findings expand our knowledge on how performance measurement systems develop over time in supply chains. With this new knowledge, managers should be better equipped to develop robust and enduring performance measurement systems in supply chains. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Case study; Evolution; Performance measurement system; Supply chain","Audition; Graphical user interfaces; Hearing aids; Managers; Supply chains; Collective action; Evolution; Inter-organisational; Interconnectivity; Longitudinal case study; Performance measure; Performance measurement system; Supply chain performance measurements; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054887600

However, the literature explaining the ways in which companies facing supply chain risk organize the key elements of their supply chain to enhance agility performance provides space for more research. We use dynamic capabilities view to explain why supply chain risk may motivate companies to integrate their supply chain to enhance agility performance. Structural equation modeling is used to test the hypotheses using data of 770 manufacturing companies obtained from the sixth version of International Manufacturing Strategy Survey. Empirical examination provides evidence that (a) a firm's supply chain risk has positive association with supplier and customer integration, (b) supplier, internal, and customer integration have positive impact on agility performance, though the impact of internal integration is weak, (c) supplier and customer integration mediate the relationship between a firm's supply chain risk and agility performance, and (d) supplier and customer integration mediate the relationship between internal integration and agility performance. The findings of this paper suggest that companies cope with supply chain risk by using integrative practices with suppliers and customers that enhance agility performance. Internal integration is the foundation for building up supplier and customer integration for agility performance.

Rather than analyzing the crowdsourcing platform facilitating the connection of company and crowd, this paper is among the first to study systematically the structural design decisions for the integration of crowdsourcing into the company innovation system. Proper structural decision support concerns the design of purpose, specificity, and composition of crowdsourcing. The aim of this paper is to explore how these design decisions relates to innovation system outcome. The results are drawn from an agent-based simulation of competing companies to observe the outcome of different designs of crowdsourcing integration into the innovation system. Both local and distant knowledge environments for innovation are simulated. The main finding is that optimal crowdsourcing design into the innovation system is contingent on the targeted innovation environment. Secondly, the results also reveal a potential conflict between the crowdsourcing platform recommendations in literature and innovation system recommendations made in this paper. Task specificity may generate platform traffic but weakens innovation outcome. In addition, the decided combination of purpose and composition is delicate to ensure highest innovative outcome. Overall, the results provide useful guidelines to companies in their efforts of implementing crowdsourcing into the innovation system. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agent-based simulation; Crowdsourcing design; Innovation environment; Innovation system; Specificity","Decision support systems; Integration; Structural design; Agent based simulation; Crowdsourcing platforms; External informations; Innovation environments; Innovation system; Knowledge environment; Optimal integration; Specificity; Crowdsourcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054007919

Prior research on open innovation has mainly focused on collaborative inventing. However, understanding the processes and outcomes of joint inventing is not sufficient for understanding sustained open-innovation activities and the competitive advantages of the actors involved in open innovation. Instead, an understanding of value creation and value capture is paramount for advancing our understanding of sustained open-innovation activities. Open innovation requires collaboration among distributed but interdependent actors who rely on each other’s capabilities for value creation and capture. Value in open innovation is driven not only by actors’ value creation but also by their ability to capture value. While value creation and value capture are discussed in the open-innovation literature, the advancement of this stream of research is hindered by conceptual ambiguity, especially in relation to the concept of value capture.

However, from a decision maker's perspective it is of interest to investigate whether the use of spatially differentiated impact assessment methods in addition leads to better decisions. Biochar production and agricultural utilization in Indonesia is an example of a micro-level decision-support case where spatial differentiation could be relevant. To study the influence of spatial differentiation on management recommendations for implementation of biochar as a waste management strategy and the choice of best performing biochar production techniques, agricultural utilization systems and geographic locations, comparisons were made between four communities living on different Indonesian islands, three biochar production techniques and two types of fertilizer. Results showed that the differences in impact scores between generic and spatially differentiated impact scores were an order of magnitude different for some of the considered impact categories. These differences influenced the identification of which system performed best when considering total damage to human health, which was mainly due to differences in accounting for impacts arising from water use. By contrast, trade-offs between impact categories combined with relatively small contribution of some spatially differentiated impacts rendered spatial differentiation less relevant with regard to total damage to ecosystems. Total impact scores were influenced to a greater extent by variations in inventories determining environmental burden and benefits, than by differences between generic and spatially differentiated characterization factors. Hence, irrespective of the scenario and type of damage considered, both generic and spatially differentiated assessments showed that implementing biochar technology in Indonesia is expected to bring environmental benefits. It was shown that spatial differentiation in impact assessment did not necessary lead to better decisions in this case study. This may suggest that depending on the goal of the LCA, practitioners should consider potential benefits of implementing spatially differentiated life cycle impact assessment methods as opposed to potential benefits from collecting site-specific inventories. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decision-making; Decision-support; LCA; LCIA; Regionalization; Spatialization","Agriculture; Damage detection; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Waste management; Characterization factors; Decision supports; LCIA; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Regionalization; Spatialization; Waste management strategies; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053078786

We study if, and under which circumstances, firms can use strategic flexibility to enter markets with variable demand. In the airline industry, we find broad support for our hypotheses. We observe less entry with more demand variation, more entry of more flexible firms, and that more flexible firms are more likely to enter markets with greater variation in demand. Furthermore, we find that this relationship is especially strong when variation in demand is harder to predict, which suggests that strategic flexibility is most valuable in unpredictable turbulent environments. Managerial Summary: We show that firms in the airline industry that choose strategic flexibility over operational efficiency are more likely to enter volatile markets. This finding is especially true when future demand is difficult to forecast using historical data.

Through a case study of the introduction of a performance measurement system (PMS) in a Danish municipality, our analysis focuses on how internal transparency unfolds in terms of addressing performance measures and aligning them with the criteria of efficiency and effectiveness. We conclude that there are two main reasons the PMS fails to address the desired effects in terms of modernising the municipality. First, an overarching focus by top management on outcome measurement results in inattention to the measurement of resource consumption and efficiencies. Second, empowerment of lower-level managers in the formulation of key performance indicators (KPIs) results in competence problems related to PMS design. Therefore, many of the KPIs are designed as milestone measures, chosen to constrain the influence of the PMS on daily activities. These factors hinder the organisation's ability to design KPIs that attribute costs to outputs and therefore render the goal of internal transparency impossible to achieve for the municipality. The consequence is a PMS that loses track of its very purpose along with a false sense of security among top management regarding the optimisation of scarce resources. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","effectiveness; efficiency; performance measurement; public sector; transparency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051033143

It was acclaimed for combining the flexibility of liberal labour markets with the security of social welfare states, thereby offering a viable formula for success in the new global economy. Nowhere was this better exemplified than in Denmark, with the Danish system repeatedly highlighted as a good example of flexicurity in action. In this article, we revisit the flexicurity concept, assessing how the Danish labour market came through the crisis. We argue that the economic crisis and especially political reforms of the unemployment insurance system have challenged the institutional complementarities of flexicurity, but that the Danish labour market is recovering and adapting to new challenges. The Danish case illustrates that institutional complementarities between flexibility and security are fragile and liable to disintegrate if the institutions providing flexicurity are not maintained and supported. © The Author(s) 2018.","crisis; Denmark; European Union; Flexicurity; unemployment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046818003

This is an important research area because servitized manufacturers face multi-source uncertainty and need to manage this uncertainty effectively to avoid business failure. A conceptual framework of four uncertainty types is investigated: environmental, technological, organisational, and relational uncertainty. We present insights from four empirical cases of service dyads collected via multiple sources of evidence including 54 semi-structured interviews, observations, and secondary data. The cases show seven interaction paths with direct knock-on effects between two uncertainty types and indirect knock-on effects between three or four uncertainty types. The findings suggest a causal chain from environmental, technological, organisational, to relational uncertainty. This research contributes to the servitization literature by (i) confirming the existence of uncertainty types, (ii) providing an in-depth characterisation of technological uncertainty, and (iii) showing the interaction paths between four uncertainty types in the form of a causal chain. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Case study; Servitization; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046153664

The research is conducted in a longitudinal approach starting in 2007 through qualitative comments provided from 30 SMEs and ending with follow-up interviews with 10 of the respondents in 2017. The findings show severe pressures experienced by the SMEs from the market, competition and regulatory forces. The longitudinal findings show that complementary proximities of geographical, organisational, temporal, technical, cognitive, vision and especially virtual proximities are important for innovation and growth providing predominantly robustness of the SMEs. The summarization of the findings reveals a model for organising the dynamic interaction of proximities to complement own SME capabilities for utilization of positive open innovation and positive bridging/ bonding of social capital. The proximities have resulted in both short-term cooperation and competition and especially is emphasised long-term collaboration. A contribution is hereby made to SME networks on how organising of dynamic complementary proximities enable innovation and growth. A contribution is made to literature for understanding the interaction of complementary dynamic proximities, which hitherto have been perceived as a “proximity paradox”.

We focus on (i) companies’ uptake of Circular Economy, (ii) the relationship between Circular Economy and sustainability and (iii) the Circular Economy practices presented. Our results show that Circular Economy has started to be integrated into the corporate sustainability agenda. Most reported activities are oriented toward the main product and packaging, focusing on end-of-life management and sourcing strategies, and to a lesser extent on circular product design and business model strategies.

We propose the concept of conversation as a way of theorizing a constructed sociality via which creative firms manage this conflict; we also propose the concept of ensemble as a way of theorizing a conversationally nurtured but fragile form of intensified sociality that most successfully combines conflicting influences when it can be achieved.

Second, we provide an overview of related and well-established theories from the territorial approach that have been largely omitted although they are ecosystem archetypes. Third, we identify the invariants across the four diverging streams from the ecosystem approach and the seven diverging streams from the territorial approach. Finally, we propose a research framework based on the comparison between key invariants from both approaches and discuss their similarities and differences that could serve as a foundation for future empirical research.

This paper addresses the need for a fast, quantitative and dynamic location decision framework. Design/methodology/approach: Unsupervised machine learning technique, i.e. k-means clustering, is used to carry out the analysis. In total, 24 different indicators of 94 countries, categorized into five groups, have been used in the analysis. After the clustering, the clusters have been compared and scored to select the feasible countries. Findings: A new framework is developed based on k-means clustering that can be used in ILD. This method provides a quantitative output without personal subjectivity. The indicators can be easily added or extracted based on the preferences of the decision-makers. Hence, it was found out that the unsupervised machine learning, i.e. k-means clustering, is a fast and flexible decision support framework that can be used in ILD. Research limitations/implications: Limitations include the generality of selected indicators and clustering algorithm used. The use of other methods and parameters may lead to alternate results. Originality/value: The framework developed through the research intends to assist the decision-makers in deciding on the facility locations. The framework can be used in international and national domains. It provides a quantitative, fast and flexible way to shortlist the potential locations. Other methods can also be used to further decide on the specific location. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Clustering; Facility location; International location decision; K-mean; Machine learning; Offshoring; Supply chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052554309

The aim is to recognize employees as key and effective players in implementing ambidextrous organizational and human resource management (HRM) strategies. We know little regarding employee norms and behaviors in complying with global market standards while surviving in environments characterized by high levels of civil violence and crime. Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents an explorative, qualitative study based on 65 semi-structured interviews and conversations with employees in Colombia and Mexico over four years. Findings: The findings of this paper indicate that the presence of non-governmental armed groups forces firms, HR departments and front-line managers to strategically exploit security measures inspired by employees’ informal institutions to protect firm assets while implementing innovative exploration strategies to improve employee work conditions, survive in unsafe environments and remain internationally competitive. Originality/value: The findings suggest that organization, HRM and employee ambidexterity are organizational advantages in illegitimate institutional contexts.

The volume includes an introduction to the institutional features of the euro area and the literature on financial integration. It examines developments in the financial structures at large and moves forward to focus on specific areas pertaining to financial intermediaries, the bond and equity markets, and market-based debt finance. It is particularly suited to researchers and students of developments in the euro area, central banking, money and banking, as well as international relations and international business more generally.

The overall position of the customers and suppliers is analyzed using the stakeholder theory while the management of the relations is dealt with using three alternative approaches, the mainstream strategic planning approach, the network and the action-experience approach. The findings are based on an empirical study of 172 Russian enterprises. It is found that Russian enterprises do not use strategic planning to any large extent. Financial constraints, the lack of a coherent regulatory framework and imperfect markets make firm managers turn to networking building on experiences from the central planning era. It is also found that networks were instrumental in the fast development of barter trade. However, the networks are weak and unless redefined, are likely to disappear when the financial constraints are overcome. Barter transactions have declined since the financial crisis in August 1998 and following the devaluation of the ruble, producers have experienced new business opportunities, reflected in growing expectations regarding sales and supplies.

Diasporic entrepreneurs have a dual embeddedness in home-society and in host-society, with networks spanning both societies, which may give them comparative advantages in innovation, exporting and growth. Enterprising is traditionally a livelihood in the Caribbean, which is carried into the diaspora and sustained by dense ties between host- and home-societies. The empirical contribution is a three-way comparison between the Caribbean diaspora, the domestic Caribbeans and diasporans from other world regions. It uses a representative sample of adults living in, or originating from, the Caribbean. Diasporans are found to often become entrepreneurs by a pull of opportunity, whereas domestics are more likely to experience a push of necessity. Diasporans, more than domestics, are networking in the transnational sphere and in the sphere of business operations. This networking promotes outcomes such as innovation, exporting and growth expectations, in contrast to negative effects from networking in the private sphere.

Although there are some relations for estimating the gas leak from an above-ground pipeline, there is no equation for the calculation of a buried pipeline leakage. The main objective of this work is to develop precise gas leak calculator equations for low- and medium-pressure buried pipelines. For this, an under-ground gas pipeline is numerically modeled considering the surrounding soil as a porous medium. Two- and three-dimensional models are used to investigate the gas leak through a hole intentionally made on the pipe. Pure methane, with a steady state, compressible and turbulent flow, is assumed through the pipe. The developed correlations are functions of the pipe diameter, the hole diameter, and the gas flow pressure. Comparison of the results with previous works in the field demonstrates that considering a one-dimensional model for the pipe and neglecting the length of the pipe after the hole causes up to 20% error. The results indicate that a two-dimensional model is not precise enough for estimating the gas leak from an under-ground pipeline (due to the soil resistance in three directions in a real situation). In addition, linear, second order and fourth order relations are observed between the amount of gas leak and the three effective parameters of the pipe entry pressure, the hole diameter, and the ratio of the hole diameter to the pipe diameter, respectively. Analysis of the results indicates that the relative difference between the results of the simulation and the results given by the developed correlations is within the range of ±7% for all cases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Buried pipelines; GHG emission; NG emission; Numerical investigation; Three-dimensional simulation","Computational fluid dynamics; Flow of gases; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Piping systems; Porous materials; Buried pipelines; Effective parameters; GHG emission; Numerical investigations; One-dimensional model; Three dimensional simulations; Three-dimensional model; Two dimensional model; Pipelines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051374124

However, no research has ever been conducted in relation to team handball. As existing literature mainly focuses on European football and US Major League sports, club managers from smaller sports lack the evidence that could assist them in developing strategies to increase attendance. This study is a step toward filling this gap. Research methods: Using robust panel data regression models deployed on data from Danish men’s team handball league matches in the seasons from 2011/12 to 2015/16, the study identifies the main determinants of spectator demand. Results and findings: The findings are largely consistent with existing research, but also reveal new insights that seem to be specific to handball. These include (1) negative effects on spectator demand due to simultaneous live television coverage of other league matches; (2) no obvious preferences for weekend matches and (3) weather-related factors, whereby rain has a positive effect and snow a negative effect, while variations in temperature have no effect. Implications: To maximize spectator attendance, we suggest that league managers and club representatives take the problem of simultaneous broadcasts from other league matches into consideration when planning the schedule in the future. Further, we argue that games should be placed in the time slots with highest spectator demand while recognizing that this can be club-specific. Finally, we recommend that clubs increase their efforts in promoting games involving strong away teams. © 2018, © 2018 European Association for Sport Management.","attendance; Denmark; handball; match day; Professional team sports; spectator demand",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050002708

Empirically, the authors analyze how proximity in a five-story building directly and indirectly influences the frequency of knowledge sharing. Design/methodology/approach: As the authors were interested in exploring the frequency of knowledge sharing among individuals in knowledge sharing dyads, they used a survey to approach individuals directly and obtain information on the frequency of their knowledge sharing. The authors have complete data on 796 dyads on which they tested their hypotheses. Further, the physical distance in a dyad was measured as the walking distance (measured in meters) between individuals. Findings: The authors first find that proximity positively affects the frequency of knowledge sharing indirectly through its promotion of social relationships. Second, it is noticeable that the direct relationship between proximity and knowledge sharing is stronger than the indirect via the promotion of social relationships. In sum, the authors’ results contribute to the knowledge sharing literature by emphasizing and clarifying how proximity both directly and indirectly influences knowledge sharing.

Neither individual nor organizational outcomes of knowledge sharing were considered. Second, the authors did not distinguish between different channels for knowledge sharing, such as face-to-face or face-to-interface. Practical implications: One practical implication is that knowledge sharing spanning, for instance, 50 m compared to knowledge sharing spanning 30 m may not necessarily require more resources, as the negative effect of 30 and 50 m distances is almost similar, as the negative effect of distance starts to fade out at 30 m. Another practical implication for the direct effect of proximity on knowledge sharing is that to foster knowledge sharing organizational practices need to create opportunities for employees to span both horizontal and vertical distances.

Although some firms use modularity to tackle this challenge, mixed effects on sustainable innovation have been reported. This study uses organisational learning and ambidexterity theory to provide insights into how TI firms can achieve ‘win-win’ situations where sustainable innovation is increased through customisation. First, we argue that customisation should be viewed two-dimensionally and identify both modularity and solution space freedom as important dimensions. We argue that modularity reflects knowledge specialisation and solution space freedom reflects knowledge variety. Both of these dimensions affect organisational learning and, in turn, sustainable innovation. Second, we argue that the relationship between customisation and organisational learning is affected by supplier characteristics, specifically supplier sophistication. Survey data from 166 managers were used to empirically test the conceptual model and hypotheses. Polynomial response surface analysis confirms that customising by balancing high degrees of both modularity and solution space freedom results in superior organisational learning. High levels of supplier sophistication do not strengthen these effects. Rather, our results show that combining high degrees of modularity with constrained solution spaces increases learning for TI firms working with less sophisticated suppliers. In addition, organisational learning fully mediates the effect of customisation on sustainable product and process innovation. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Meanwhile, as part of the continued digitization of industrial processes, various sensor technologies are deployed that enable us to record time-varying attributes (a.k.a., time series) of such entities, thus producing correlated time series. To enable accurate forecasting on such correlated time series, this paper proposes two models that combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The first model employs a CNN on each individual time series, combines the convoluted features, and then applies an RNN on top of the convoluted features in the end to enable forecasting.

We are given a large collection of trajectories that stem from many different drivers. Only a small number of the trajectories are labeled with driver identifiers, and only some drivers are used in labels. The problem is to label correctly the unlabeled trajectories with driver identifiers. This is important in auto insurance to detect possible fraud and to identify the driver in, e.g., pay-as-you-drive settings when a vehicle has been involved in an incident. To solve the problem, we first propose a Trajectory-to-Image (T2I) encoding scheme that captures both geographic features and driving behavior features of trajectories in 3D images. Next, we propose a multi-task, deep learning model called T2INet for estimating the total number of drivers in the unlabeled trajectories, and then we partition the unlabeled trajectories into groups so that the trajectories in a group belong to the same driver. Experimental results on a large trajectory data set offer insight into the design properties of T2INet and demonstrate that T2INet is capable of outperforming baselines and the state-of-the-art method. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Deep learning; Multi-task learning; Representation learning; Trajectory analysis","Deep learning; Digital storage; Image coding; Knowledge management; Design properties; Driving behavior; Encoding schemes; Insurance industry; Multitask learning; Representation learning; State-of-the-art methods; Trajectory analysis; Trajectories",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058041785

It draws on institutional theory and the concept of response strategies to institutional pressures to explore the institutional barriers that female entrepreneurs encounter and highlights the strategies women employ to overcome them. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds on a case study of female entrepreneurs engaged in food processing in Tanzania. It draws on semi-structured interviews with nine female entrepreneurs, one focus group discussion with six female entrepreneurs and two semi-structured interviews with representatives from women’s business associations (WBAs). Findings: This paper reveals a repertoire of active strategies enacted by women entrepreneurs, including advocacy through WBAs, bootstrapping, semi-informal operations, co-location of home and business, spouse involvement in the business, downplay of gender identity, reliance on persistence and passion and networking through WBAs. While these strategies involve various degrees of agency, the findings indicate that collective efforts through WBAs offer women the most promise in terms of influencing institutional structures. Originality/value: While there is a growing body of literature examining how institutions influence female entrepreneurs, there is a dearth of knowledge on how women experience institutional complexities and actively react to institutional barriers, complexities and contradictions.

Little is known about the supply network implications of M&As, which can be a major issue, especially for firms acquiring competitors that share suppliers, customers and associated resources. Using social capital as a theoretical lens, this research aims to investigate the implications of an acquisition on supply network relationships. Design/methodology/approach: The acquisition of a large truck manufacturer by its competitor is investigated using an exploratory case study methodology. A total of 24 interviews were conducted across ten companies in the focal supply network with an analysis of financial data. Findings: The findings from the study provide evidence that firms seeking to acquire such relationships cannot directly buy the social capital embedded within those relationships. They identify pre-acquisition characteristics and post-integration factors to understand how the supply network as a whole draws on the structural, cognitive and relational dimensions of social capital to address discrepancies in the merging network. Originality/value: This study depicts an empirically grounded, theory-based account of a post-acquisition supply network integration process, showing how an M&A can drastically impact customer and supplier network relationships. The main contribution of this paper lies in extending our understanding of how social capital cannot be simply transferred from one organisation to another during an M&A. Rather, this work illustrates how social capital in supply networks is transformed by considering the pre- and post-acquisition social capital dynamics of the merging networks. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Social Capital; Supply chain management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052593488

Design/methodology/approach: The objective of the study is fulfilled by reviewing the literature on experience economy and co-creation within a cultural heritage context and then using it to design appropriate research tools to collect empirical data through qualitative interviews within the context of a single case study. The Medieval Town of Rhodes (MTR), Greece, serves as the case in this study. In fact, this study analyzes primary data from 25 interviews with participants in GTs in the MTR. Findings: The GT participant’s views of their GT experience were explored, and it was evaluated whether they fit any of the three generations of experience economy with an emphasis on co-creation of experience. The findings show that, in the MTR-GT services, the characteristics of mainly the first and second generation experience economies are found, while little emphasis is given to the third generation experience economy. Based on the empirical results, the RIF model (R: “Resources,” I: “Interactions,” F: “Feelings”) was created: this proposes that both the process of experience co-creation and optimal GT experiences are realized by providing participants with appropriate resources, multiple types of interactions and opportunities to generate positive and pleasant feelings. This model illustrates the intertwining, multi-dimensional facets of an optimal co-created GT experience that service providers and tour operators should provide to their customers. Research limitations/implications: The present study has several limitations that need to be mentioned. First, this research is a single case study; the MTR serves as the case, focusing on one cultural heritage service, GTs. This fact can put the study’s validity in question. Moreover, as the research is conducted by a single person, there is the risk of subjective bias. Another limitation is that this study is not a longitudinal one; the latter could lead to more accurate findings. The number and the nationality of participants constitute the 4th and final limitation of the research. More specifically, the sample is not perceived to be representative of the population nor generalizable, while visitors from more nationalities could have been interviewed. In relation to this, the judgmental sampling method was used because the population of the study could not be defined. This serves as the fifth limitation of the study. Practical implications: Tour operators and tour guides can exploit the characteristics of GT activities included in the proposed RIF model. By incorporating these elements in GT experiences, the process of experience co-creation could be effectively supported. An optimal GT experience that incorporates intertwining and multi-dimensional facets could be provided. To begin with, the physical setting where the tour takes place must be well preserved, so that it can capture the attention of the participants. The route of the tour should not be exhausting but convenient for all participants and should include various landscapes. On the other hand, tour guides should provide interesting, relevant and cohesive information. Moreover, a tour guide needs to display charismatic behavior to gain the tour group’s trust and generate positive feelings impressing and immersing participants in the experience and encouraging in them a sense of togetherness. Within the context of the tour, tangible elements such as brochures and maps should be provided, allowing vistors to tailor the experience according to their needs and preferences. Furthermore, interaction between the guide and the tour group, as well as among the participants themselves, should be encouraged. In relation to this, the tour group could be divided into sub-groups according to common features such as age. The guides could also come up with a topic to be jointly discussed and participatory activities such as games could be organized. Finally, participants should have some freedom during the tour; time to explore the setting on their own or a visit to specific places on request. Originality/value: The originality of the paper lies in the development of the RIF model, illustrating the on-site optimal experience within the context of GTs taking place in the MTR, the setting of the research. The construction of the RIF model was based on an investigation into actual GT participant’s perspectives on GTs. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Co-creation; Cultural heritage; Empirical study; Experience economy; Guided tours; Model","cultural heritage; design; empirical analysis; life satisfaction; literature review; local economy; model; modeling; participatory approach; perception; Dodecanese; Greece; Rhodes [Dodecanese]; Rhodes [Southern Aegean]; Southern Aegean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054637370

Specifically, the study investigates the differentiation of Islamic banks (IBs) from conventional banks, the role of religion in choosing Islamic banking and the perception of IBs amongst the consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a mixed-method approach, qualitative research along with a survey of users of conventional and Islamic banking. Factor analysis identified underlying dimensions and cluster analysis ascertained the differences between users and non-users of Islamic banking. Inferential statistics were used to test purported hypotheses. Findings: The study finds that the users and non-users both perceive that Islamic banking is not completely interest-free. Furthermore, consumers presume that IBs are more of eyewash and are not truly practicing Islamic banking. Moreover, religion is not a major factor that attracts new users but there are also other important factors in marketing Islamic banking, such as service quality, convenience, branch network, etc. Originality/value: This is one of the sparse studies in the field of Islamic banking consumer behaviour, which uses focus groups of users and non-users, and in-depth interviews of experts, to identify the issues and factors considered relevant and important by the users rather than relying only on literature review. Furthermore, it also provides a profile of users versus non-users of Islamic banking which is very useful for segmentation and targeting of customers. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption of Islamic banking; Consumer perception; Islamic banks; Mixed-method",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053402900

We understand safety standardization and the responses to it as a strategizing process, where standards are legitimized, taken up, handled or countered. Design/methodology/approach: Ethnographic fieldwork was conducted in a Danish hospital department. The study included observations, interviews and documents studies. The authors apply a Bourdieusian perspective, where the authors focus on the narratives told by standard inventers, managers and nurses to examine and understand their strategizing activities in relation to safety standardization. We understand strategizing as interested action emerging in the dialectics between a habitus and a position in a field. Findings: The authors show how the standardization of work rests on the master narrative of patient safety management and how this narrative clashes with the nurses’ practical perception of good care, which rests on the counter-narrative of the clinical judgment.

Design/methodology/approach: The starting point for the paper is a narrative from a conference the authors attended where the authors, as researchers, found themselves on slippery and emotionally charged ground. Using a critical, reflexive approach informed by post-structuralism, the ambition was to deconstruct gaps between rhetoric and practice and critique normative understandings of the nature of ethically sound co-production processes in collaborative research. More specifically, at the conference, the authors sought to expose and discuss the gap between the good intentions and the own practice as researchers in a collaborative research project at a major hospital. However, instead of reflexive discussions with the research community, the authors experienced that the conduct was criticized and categorized as unethical practice. Findings: Instead of omitting sensitive phenomena from the research process, the authors argue that it is an ethical imperative to investigate these phenomena in order to gain insight into what is at stake in dialogical, reflexive processes not only between researchers and research participants—but also between researchers in the research community. An awareness of the emergent nature of power relations in all processes of knowledge production may strengthen the practical validity of “co-produced” knowledge in action research.

Evidence supporting this statement abounds in the literature and in practice. The models, however, tend to be driven by experience, rather than grounded in theory. The purpose of this paper is to explore theoretical underpinnings for such models, with the SOEM used for illustrative purposes.

Correspondence of this model with the SOEM is explored. Key elements considered include contextual factors external to the enterprise, diverse stakeholders, mediating forces, enterprise culture and representative enterprise processes. Findings: Understanding the theoretical underpinnings of excellence models—their elements and the interactions and synergies of these elements—enables more sure adaptation of such models to specific enterprise contexts, and more sure course corrections whenever corrections are needed.

In their paper, the authors (N&T) develop a method for identifying strongly sustainable companies as a basis for consumer communication. N&T test their method on a case study of five chemical companies and conclude that two of these are strongly sustainable, essentially because they had obtained a higher number of eco-labels than the average across the five companies. While we agree with N&T on the relevance of applying a strong sustainability perspective in the assessment of companies, we are afraid that their method can lead to misguided consumer communication. At the root of this concern is that N&T 1) use a market average as reference to decide whether a company has a strong or weak sustainability performance and 2) use the number of eco-labels as an environmental indicator. We lay the foundation of this response by briefly accounting for the academic origin of the weak/strong sustainability dichotomy. We then present our argument against the method presented by N&T.

Nevertheless, although an ample number of standalone case studies have performed energy analyses in the hospitality industry, empirical studies focusing on exergy are scarce. Extending this line of research, the present study aims to exemplify the conduct of exergy analyses alongside energy ones in optimising environmental management intelligence and improving decision making processes in hospitality accommodation. In doing so, hotels located in international tourism destinations, where tourism has a significant economic impact on the respective countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP), participated in the study. Energy data from two hotels situated in the Dominican Republic and, from two hotel units located in Greece was collected and analysed in a comparative manner. Findings revealed that energy flows and energy efficiency alone are not sufficient for a comprehensive assessment of hotels’ energy profiles. Thus, it is suggested that corresponding exergy flows and efficiency rates should also be estimated along with the energy ones. This study infers that location and hotel star rating classification do not seem to be key parameters in assessing lodgings’ energy quality profiles, which suggests the need for further research. The practical implications for hotel managers are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Efficiency; Energy; Environmental management; Exergy; Hospitality industry; Hotels","Decision making; Efficiency; Environmental management; Exergy; Hotels; Comprehensive assessment; Decision making process; Empirical studies; Energy; Environmental profile; Gross domestic products; Hospitality industry; International tourisms; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053073990

The paper takes the research a step further, exploring the role of legitimacy in CSR communication research. Design/methodology/approach: A literature collection methodology, combined with directed content analysis, was used to identify central themes in the literature. Findings: The following categories of studies were identified: perception, impact and promotion studies; image and reputation studies; performance studies; and conceptual/rhetorical studies. Addressed from a legitimacy perspective, the study found that the most important types of legitimizing communicative practices articulated in the four types of studies were related to: seeking knowledge about stakeholders through perception, impact and promotion activities; monitoring and controlling the environment through image and reputation activities; creating stakeholder value through collaboration and engagement; and persuading and convincing stakeholders through rhetorics, CSR models and concepts. The study also found that practices and activities related to perceiving stakeholders’ expectations, needs and requirements are assumed to be most effective for corporations aiming at building or maintaining legitimacy. Originality/value: The key contribution of the paper lies in exploring how corporate legitimacy is anticipated and extrapolated in the CSR communication literature, including which pinpointed CSR communication strategies and practices are assumed to be more effective than others in bridging stakeholders’ perceptions of corporations’ social and environmental actions. Until date, no reviews exist of the role of legitimacy in CSR communication research. © 2018, Anne Ellerup Nielsen and Christa Thomsen.","Content analysis; Corporate communications; Corporate social responsibility; Legitimacy",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053257873

It describes and analyzes a complex ethics dilemma within the purview of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate sustainability (CS) and examines how this dilemma impacts critical stakeholders, thus offering several “opportunities to learn” for professionals. Design/methodology/approach: The case takes a stakeholder perspective, applying Cavanagh et al. (1981) and Gao’s (2008) ethical judgement framework. It is situated within a qualitative approach to textual analysis. Social actors, topics and evaluative statements were identified and grouped into broader categories. Findings: Six major stakeholders were directly affected by Volkswagen’s behavior: customers, investors and shareholders, the US Environmental Protection Agency, German authorities, European institutions and society-at-large. Stakeholder concerns were condensed into three dominant themes: economic, legal and environmental. According to the ethical judgment framework, Volkswagen corporate behavior showed ethical problems, theoretically demonstrating that under no ethical principle was Volkswagen’s actions justifiable, even under instrumental justifications. Research limitations/implications: The analysis was primarily based on corporate material and news media reporting. Consequently, diverse managers’ prospectives and opinions are not entirely captured. Practical implications: This paper offers several “opportunities to learn” for corporate communication professionals. Originality/value: The focus on stakeholder perspectives allows professionals to take an outside-in approach when evaluating the impact of corporate actions on stakeholders’ interests. The case analysis through Cavanagh et al. (1981) and Gao’s (2008) ethical judgment framework provides a practical theoretical instrument to assess corporate behaviors that can be used both as pre- and post-evaluations of corporate actions on CSR and CS issues. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Automobile industry; Case study; Corporate behaviours; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental scandal; Ethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053240754

Findings: The paper finds that different types of communication on ISM develop in different types of organizations. Participatory communication capable of changing the organization only develops when coworkers perceive that they have a license to critique. The paper, therefore, proposes to distinguish between three different types of communication arenas created by ISM: a quiet arena, a knowledge-sharing arena and a participatory communication arena.

A deeper, summative analysis of ISM across more and various organizations in multiple countries has to confirm the findings.

The present paper reports on a multiple case study comprising 23 PBOs and demonstrates the importance of ‘configurations of KG mechanisms’ for facilitating learning and capability development. This paper develops four distinct configurations (balanced, formalistic, interactive, and fragile) that promote three principal organisational-level learning processes: shifting, leveraging and adapting.

Drawing upon interdisciplinary sociological and philosophical material, the present article suggests three ways to refine the relational theory of risk. First, I call attention to threatening relationships that are dangerous rather than risky. Second, I argue that a risk relationship only implies the ‘exclusion’ of the threatening object if the person who constructs the risk relationship chooses to distrust the threatening object rather than to trust it. Third, I amend the relational theory’s explanation of social risk conflicts by raising the question of the origin of the harm, either in the injured party itself or in the external environment. These refinements strengthen the explanatory power of the relational theory both regarding sociology and ethics. In consequence, I propose a Relational Theory of Risk and Danger. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ethics; Luhmann; risk conflict; risk construction; trust","Engineering; Safety engineering; Ethical implications; ethics; Explanatory power; External environments; Luhmann; Relational theories; Risk research; trust; Philosophical aspects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015640483

These frictions pertain to the construction and operationalization of university Europeanization, on the way towards a Europeanized academic field. The organization in this study is in a discursive stand-by position, caused by both organizational structures, and contradicting accounts of Europeanization. Design: The data set comprises, first, a thematic analysis of the official internationalization strategy pursued by the university, and an interview with its initiator. Second, a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 13 professors is conducted, complemented by responses to short standardized questionnaires. Findings: The change process is described as mimetic isomorphism, and faculty opposes normative isomorphic change. Three main areas of friction are identified. First, this study demonstrates that professors and university leadership construct Europeanization differently. Second, professors express a high awareness of independence from university governance. Third, professors appear to partially align their and their staff's research activities with national standards. The university leadership, pushing for Europeanized standards, acknowledges the legitimacy of these conflicting strategies. Implications and Value: The Europeanization of higher education is investigated from an institutional-narratological view in an attempt to connect organizational research with research on societal Europeanization. Europeanization is subjected to intra-organizational struggles over the interpretation of the term. Counter-narratives of what Europeanization means should be recognized in order to pursue a pluralistic notion of Europeanization. © 2018, © 2018 The European Association for the Advancement of the Social Sciences.","counter-narrative; Europeanization; higher education; institutional theory; isomorphism; narrative; organization","academic research; conceptual framework; higher education; institutional framework; leadership; organizational change; questionnaire survey; theoretical study; university sector; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049124948

To shed light on this question, we ask how candidate ethnicity, gender, and age affect the recruitment preferences among politicians regarding the candidates for top administrative positions. Our study uses a survey experiment with random assignment of 1,688 Flemish local politicians to one of eight different descriptions of applicants to the leading managerial position of their local authority. We find that ethnic minorities, women, and younger candidates are generally considered more qualified for the job. Moreover, the impact of ethnicity and gender on recruitment preferences is conditional on politicians’ ideological predispositions: Left-wing politicians consider ethnic minority candidates more competent, whereas right-wing politicians consider them less representative and are less inclined to invite them for job interviews than candidates from the ethnic majority. Furthermore, politicians furthest to the left are more inclined than right-wing politicians to recognize women as representative of the public at large and support inviting them for job interviews. © The Author(s) 2018.

It also investigates whether the impact of these self-identities on energy saving at home is shared or different across countries in Europe. Data comes from a survey of a representative sample of adults from 10 European countries (N ≈ 320 from each country). Energy saving was measured with five items representing the array of energy-saving tips that European households are offered in campaign material and on websites. Psychological constructs were also measured with multiple items taken or adapted from previous research. The multiple-item measurement instruments possess acceptable construct and discriminant validity as well as partial metric invariance across the 10 countries, which is sufficient for the country comparisons. Structural equation modelling reveals that (a) both environmental and frugal self-identities are strongly linked to attitudes towards energy saving, but (b) more weakly related to behaviour, and (c) the latter effect is completely mediated through the attitude in most countries and partly mediated in the remaining countries. Implications for the understanding of energy-saving behaviour and policies are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cross-country comparison; Energy saving; Environmental self-identity; Frugality; Structural equation modelling","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; Country comparisons; Environmental self-identity; European Countries; Frugality; Measurement instruments; Partial metric; Representative sample; Structural equation modelling; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053177205

The heavily cited 4I Model made significant progress towards addressing these questions, based on the idea that exploration and exploitation unfold differently across organizational levels, with exploration as feed-forward from the individual towards the organizational level, and exploitation as feedback from the organizational towards the individual level. The authors’ critical application of the model questions this idea, suggesting that exploration and exploitation unfold through similar patterns from the individual level towards the organizational level with iterative feedback loops. This repositioning of the 4I Model affords a detailed understanding of both exploration and exploitation processes as well as the temporal and spatial interactions between them. To demonstrate the utility of this theorizing and to add new insights to the process literature on organizational learning, the authors rely on a longitudinal case study of how a management team engaged in technology-enabled strategic renewal in a Danish local government organization. © 2018 British Academy of Management",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052786642

Additionally, countries with livestock-intensive farming face problems with disposal of nutrients in animal manure. The availability of chemical fertilizers has changed farmers' past dependence on manure. Nowadays, despite its nutrient content, manure is sometimes considered as a waste product. However, if the characteristics of manure and other waste streams could be enhanced through processing, it could be transformed into an alternative bio-based fertilizer recycling the nutrients within the farming sector. This would also create opportunities for nutrient exchange between different European regions. However, a key question is what is needed for farmers to accept these products as replacements for their current chemical fertilizer use? In this paper, key attributes determining the acceptance of alternative bio-based fertilizer products are identified. Based on the identified attributes, a discrete choice experiment was designed to reveal farmers' preferences and Willingness-To-Pay for these attributes. Identical experiments were conducted in seven different European countries. The results indicate that farmers from the different countries have common preferences for concentrated products that have certainty in the nitrogen content and at a lower price than chemical fertilizer. Other attributes such as the presence of organic carbon, hygienization of the product and fast release of nutrients were only statistically significant in some countries. The results imply that a bio-based fertilizer similar to chemical fertilizers could be sold at around 65% of the price of mineral fertilizer. Additionally, we show which attributes industry should take into consideration when estimating the demand for new bio-based fertilizer products. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-based fertilizer; Choice experiment; Nutrient recycling; Processing","Agriculture; Manures; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Processing; Recycling; Bio-based; Chemical fertilizers; Choice experiments; Discrete choice experiments; European agriculture; European Countries; Mineral fertilizers; Nutrient recycling; Nitrogen fertilizers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049077148

However, school-based programmes often face implementation challenges, and the identification of factors influencing the implementation process is considered important in order to secure the effectiveness of future interventions. The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the various implementation stages during the initial years of a programme tripling the amount of physical education at the primary school level. Document analysis of publicly available programme descriptions and meeting minutes, were conducted. Document analysis was complemented by two semi-structured group interviews with main programme managers to gather in-depth programme experiences and perspectives. Results show that early involvement of schools may ensure the best possible match between programmes and the needs and resources of schools, and that an ongoing shared partnership may help programme managers address program challenges in early stages. It seems that predetermined core elements in programmes are essential. At the same time programmes must be flexible enough for adaptation to individual school contexts. Finally, the implementation of triple the amount of physical education, is supported by teachers receiving a professional development course focusing on how to organise outdoor physical education in different seasons and weather conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CHAMPS-study DK; Health promotion; Implementation; Physical activity; Physical education; Qualitative research approaches; School","education; health education; physical activity; qualitative analysis; research method; article; health promotion; human; human experiment; interview; manager; physical activity; physical education; primary school; professional development; qualitative research; season; teacher; weather; child; Denmark; exercise; health promotion; organization and management; physical education; preschool child; procedures; program development; program evaluation; public relations; qualitative research; school; school health service; Child; Child, Preschool; Denmark; Exercise; Health Promotion; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Interviews as Topic; Physical Education and Training; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Qualitative Research; School Health Services; Schools",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048738972

Thus, the aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the adoption, implementation and maintenance of the Svendborgproject (SP) – an effective real-world programme comprising schools to implement triple the amount of physical education (PE) in pre-school to sixth grade in six primary schools in the municipality of Svendborg, Denmark. SP has been maintained for ten years and scaled up to all municipal schools since it was initiated in 2008. The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework (RE-AIM) was applied as an analytic tool through a convergent mixed method triangulation design. Results show that SP has been implemented with high fidelity and become an established part of the municipality and school identity. The successful implementation and dissemination of the programme has been enabled through the introduction of a predominantly bottom-up approach combined with simple non-negotiable requirements. The results show that this combination has led to a better fit of programmes to the individual school context while still obtaining high implementation fidelity. Finally, the early integration of research has legitimated and benefitted the programme. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CHAMPS-study DK; Health promotion; Implementation; Physical activity; Physical education; Process evaluation; RE-AIM; School setting","analytical framework; education; physical activity; public health; research; adoption; article; Denmark; health promotion; human; human experiment; identity; physical activity; physical education; primary school; attitude to health; child; evaluation study; exercise; health promotion; interview; organization and management; physical education; procedures; program development; program evaluation; psychology; questionnaire; school; school health service; school teacher; student; Denmark; Attitude to Health; Child; Denmark; Exercise; Health Promotion; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Physical Education and Training; Program Development; Program Evaluation; School Health Services; School Teachers; Schools; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048565073

Few studies have analyzed the life cycle of new routine creation and replication as an integrated process. In an in-depth case study of England's Highways Agency, this paper shows that the creation and replication of a new routine across multiple sites involves four sequential steps: envisioning, experimenting, entrenching and enacting. We contribute to the capabilities research in two ways: first, by showing how different organizational levels, capabilities and logics (cognitive and behavioural) shape the development of new routines; and second, by identifying how distinct evolutionary cycles of variation and selective retention occur during each step in the process. In contrast with prior research on replication as an exact copy of a template or existing routine, our study focuses on the replication of an entirely new routine (based on novel principles) that is adapted to fit local operational conditions during its large-scale replication across multiple sites. We draw upon insights from adjacent ‘practice research’ and suggest how capabilities and practice studies may complement each other in future research on the evolution of routines. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Capabilities; Creation; Organizational hierarchy; Replication; Routines","Highway engineering; Capabilities; Creation; Organizational hierarchies; Replication; Routines; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047075618

These underline the importance of EU-funding in facilitating knowledge transfer and innovation between Finland and Russia.

While the process models represent the dominant, albeit rather simplistic perspective, they primarily serve as a reference point and communication device. Here, the knowledge perspective offers a supplementary perspective by filling the gaps left by the formal processes with informal cross boarder knowledge exchange. In comparison, the translation perspective is found to represent an emergent approach in managing FEI where process models, knowledge strategies and objects become integrated elements in more advanced navigational strategies for key players. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","case study; front end innovation; knowledge sharing; Process models; translation process",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042778144

In the current study, we use responses from 324 business expatriates in China and take departure in the two elements of the person-environment fit theory, supplementary fit and complementary fit. We use the supplementary fit element of this theory to explain why emotional control (low dispositional anger and high self-control) increases performance and satisfaction in China. We rely on the complementary element of person-environment fit theory for understanding why this effect may vary between AEs and SIEs. Our argument is that as opposed to SIEs, AEs could add contact and knowledge from the parent company to the local organization thus complementing it. Our findings, with regard to supplementary fit, show that self-control has a positive association with both job performance and job satisfaction while trait anger has a negative effect on job satisfaction. In relation to complementary fit, also as expected, we found a buffering moderation effect of being AE, meaning that the negative effect of their trait anger on job satisfaction was diminished for this group. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anger; Assigned expatriates; Emotions; Person-environment fit; Personality; Self-control; Self-initiated expatriates",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042476219

However, very few empirical studies have explored these processes over an extended period. To address this lacuna, we report findings from a three-year ethnographic study that explored the emergence and development of leadership in a self-managed interorganizational R&D team. Findings show that in the context of various events that impacted on the team, leadership emerged through interactions, processes and practices that were perceived by team members to develop and advance shared goals and shared identity. Leadership responses to uncertainty surrounding the project were generally legitimated by team members’ background and expertise in relation to this shared identity, while a lack of perceived legitimacy also compromised leadership. These observations are consistent with arguments that leadership revolves around the creation and enactment of shared social identity. However, they also suggest that the form and nature of leadership is hard to predict because it is heavily structured by specific identity-relevant practices and perceptions that arise in the context of unforeseeable events. © The Author(s) 2017.","ethnography; identity leadership; interorganizational R&D; legitimacy; relational leadership; sensemaking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041907668

The experience of home as physical, social, individual and temporal belonging is important to immigrants' adaptation processes. Extant literature either focuses on dimensions of home without reference to immigrants, studies material culture related to home, or researches identity projects of migrants without explicitly focusing on their subjective experience of home. This study adopts a phenomenological perspective to gain an in-depth understanding of first generation immigrants' subjective transcultural experiencing of home. By means of autobiographical phenomenological interviews the study identifies three ways of experiencing home: Longing for the past; transcultural mingling of social relationships and consumption; and experiencing home within oneself. The study corroborates extant literature on home, material culture and consumer acculturation and complements this literature with an additional, inner-directed focus of experiencing home.

This article argues that euro crisis governance is best understood not just in terms of one form of power but instead as evolving through different constellations of coercive, institutional, and ideational power that favored different EU actors over the course of the crisis, from the initial fast-burning phase (2010–2012), where the coercive and ideational power of Northern European member states in the European Council was strongest, to the slow-burning phase (2012–2016), when greater influence was afforded supranational actors through the use of ideational and institutional power. © 2017 The Authors.

Some of these have also been incorporated into regulation, such as the European Commission Directive 98/44 on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. However, the incorporation of ethically based restrictions into patent legislation has not had the effect of satisfying all concerns. In this article, we will systematically compare the richness of ethical concerns surrounding biotech patenting, with the limited scope of ethical concerns actually addressed in the patent system. As sources of our analyses we will use literature and document studies and a survey with important stakeholders and experts related to Norwegian patenting in the aquacultural biotechnology sector. We will structure the analyses with an ethical matrix, developed for this purpose. Showing the misalignment of the discussions within and outside the patent system, we suggest that an important reason for the ethical controversy still surrounding patenting is that ethical questions keep being framed in a narrow way within the system. Until a richer set of ethical considerations is addressed head-on within the patent system, the patent system will continue to evoke academic and interest group criticism, potentially contributing to a legitimacy crisis of the whole system. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biotechnology; Ethics; Ordre public and morality; Patents","aquaculture; bioethics; biotechnology; ethics; human; legislation and jurisprudence; Norway; patent; social control; Aquaculture; Bioethical Issues; Biotechnology; Ethical Analysis; Humans; Norway; Patents as Topic; Social Control, Formal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028525208

The first strategy is stimulating an open place brand process in which there are more than enough opportunities for an open debate and discussion in the process of developing and implementing a place brand. The second strategy concerns stimulating an identity-image match where the communicated place image reflects the place identity. It is hypothesized that each strategy has a direct positive effect on place reputation as well as two indirect (mediated) positive effects by increasing place brand adoption and reducing conflicts about place marketing by and between place stakeholders. The research applies structural equation modelling to data from nationwide surveys in the Netherlands and Germany among professionals working in place marketing and branding (N = 444). Results show that the first strategy has a positive direct effect on place reputation. The indirect effect on place reputation mediated by place brand adoption is positive, whereas the indirect effect mediated by the level of conflicts among stakeholders is negative. Thus, an open place brand process leads to more conflicts among stakeholders and thereby affecting place reputation negatively. However, the net result of these two indirect effects is still positive albeit small. The second strategy has a strong direct positive effect on place reputation as well as two positive mediated effects though place brand adoption and reducing conflicts among stakeholders.

Knowledge of the informal role profiles of these formal roles is still rare. HR and R&D Managers do not know which informal role profile might suit them best, thus having difficulties to assign the best candidates for jobs in innovation management. Researchers cannot help to resolve the problem. Our research answers the question what innovation managers really do, by analysing their tasks, skills and traits, theoretically based on informal role theories. Furthermore, we will analyse how these characteristics change with company size. To provide answers to our research questions we choose a multiple-case study approach. We found, among others, that innovation managers fulfil the role of the relationship and process promotor or a combination of both with the champion, but we also found, that the innovation manager’s roles profile becomes fuzzier with shrinking company size. Our results have practical implications for top management and also HR and R&D managers, enabling them to better select and steer employees in innovation management. Researchers will be able to build on our results because we offer a comprehensive understanding of the informal role profiles of innovation managers based on informal role theories. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Innovation champion; Innovation management; Innovation manager; Personal characteristics; Promotor model; Role profile; Role theories",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019627044

To progress, we first consider functional, institutional, and critical event explanations for cultural characteristics and boundaries. Second, we contrast theories of explicit global structure based on countries with theories based on implicit cultural groups. Third, we consider the implications of explicit country-based and implicit culture group-based theorizing for the relationship between explicit country boundaries and implicit cultural group boundaries. We do so at three levels that are roughly analogous in country-based and culture group-based theorizing: country/ethnic group, country cluster/civilization, and within-country region/subcultural group. Political science and other fields that help to understand the relationship between countries and cultural groups, but that seldom appear in IB discussions of culture, are emphasized. One main conclusion is that countries remain linked to cultures because of continuing political reasons for cultural groups to seek to be governed by co-ethnics. Political considerations other than cultural identity, however, also continue to promote important discontinuities between country and cultural group boundaries. We suggest that IB scholars and scholarly IB associations should reconsider their traditional way of defining the IB field because of our advancing understanding of the complex mix of correspondence and discontinuity between country and cultural group boundaries. © 2017, Academy of International Business.","country clusters; cross-country diversity; cross-cultural management; cultural groups; FICE; intra-country diversity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019230457

Presenteeism not only threatens employees' health but also substantially drains productivity and drives considerable costs. When they are sick, employees have the choice of whether to go to work or to stay at home. Therefore, determinants of (sickness) absenteeism and presenteeism should be examined simultaneously. Nursing homes are faced with a particularly high prevalence of both absenteeism and presenteeism and are therefore a relevant object of investigation. Purpose: The aim of our study is to analyze the effect of job demands and job resources on absenteeism, presenteeism, and the tendency to choose one behavior (being absent or being present in times of sickness) rather than the other over the last 12 months. To do so, we identify the determinants of absenteeism and/or presenteeism behavior based on theory and existing research about absenteeism, presenteeism, and job demands and job resources. After our empirical analysis, we provide explanations for our findings and offer practical suggestions for how to decrease the frequencies of absenteeism and presenteeism. Methodology: In this study, a sample of 212 nurses from German nursing homes was used for an ordinal logistic regression analysis. Results: Our results show that role overload significantly increases the frequencies of both absenteeism and presenteeism. A good team climate decreases absenteeism and increases the tendency to choose presenteeism rather than absenteeism, whereas strategic training and development opportunities decrease presenteeism and increase the tendency to choose absenteeism rather than presenteeism. © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Little is currently known about how boards' emphases on these various governance objectives contribute to performance. Purpose: Using a dominant logics perspective, this article aims to detect the governance logics that hospital boards emphasize, to determine whether there are distinct clusters of hospitals with the same sets of emphases, and to show how cluster membership relates to board characteristics and financial performance. Methodology: Using factor analysis, we identify latent classes of governance objectives and use hierarchical cluster analysis to detect distinct clusters with varying emphasis on the classes. We then use multinomial regression to explore the associations between cluster membership and board characteristics (size, gender diversity, and occupational diversity) and examine the associations between clusters and financial performance using OLS regression. Results: Classes of objectives reflecting three governance theories - agency theory, stewardship theory, and stakeholder theory - can be distinguished, and hospitals can be divided into four clusters based on their board's relative emphasis on the classes. Cluster membership is significantly associated with board characteristics. There is also a significant association between cluster membership and hospital financial performance, with two of three groups performing significantly better than the reference group. Conclusion: High performance in hospitals can be the result of governance logics, which, compared to simple board characteristics, are associated with better financial outcomes.

The resource-based view (RBV) of the firm and the natural resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm are revisited to lay the theoretical foundation for exploring how the social dimension might be addressed. Social capabilities are then explored by looking at the social entrepreneurship literature and illustrative cases with the purpose of elaborating RBV toward a social resource-based view (SRBV) of the firm. Three illustrative cases, which represent social businesses located in catastrophe-ridden Haiti, show how capabilities are used to overcome challenging constraints. The goal for the social entrepreneur is to employ the appropriate capabilities to ensure economic success, a positive environmental impact, and social benefits that leave the local community in a better position than without the business. Just as NRBV is a previous elaboration of RBV, so can SRBV be an elaborated theoretical foundation for future research. The components of a theory are systematically addressed by extending the range of variables (adding social capabilities), extending the domain (including stakeholders with economic, environmental, and/or social stakes), and offering propositions on variable relationships and outcome predictions (linking social capabilities and shared TBL value creation). By highlighting the social capabilities of social entrepreneurs, this research illuminates the micro-foundations of corporate social responsibility, emphasizing the value of individual level analyses. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Natural resource-based view; Resource-based view; Shared value; Social business; Social entrepreneurship; Sustainability; Triple bottom line",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991721624

Skous Vej 4, Aarhus C, 8000, Denmark","Corporate social responsibility is a complex discipline that not only demands responsible behavior in production processes but also includes the concepts of communicative transparency and dialogue. Stakeholder dialogue is therefore expected to be an integrated part of the CSR strategy (Morsing and Schultz in Bus Ethics: A Eur Rev 14(4):323–338, 2006). However, only few studies have addressed the practice of CSR stakeholder dialogue and the challenges related hereto. This article adopts a postmodern perspective on CSR stakeholder dialogue. Based on a comprehensive single case study on stakeholder dialogue in a global dairy company, we focus on the complexity of CSR dialogue with multiple stakeholders. Drawing on a critical reflexive methodology (Alvesson and Kärreman in Acad Manag Rev 32(4):1265–1281, 2007), we develop the research question: How is CSR multi-stakeholder dialogue practiced, experienced, and articulated in an empirical context? The purpose is to understand the underlying assumptions, expectations, and principles guiding CSR multi-stakeholder dialogue in an empirical setting, as we focus on how key stakeholders articulate and anticipate the values of stakeholder dialogue and how the actual stakeholder dialogues are enacted. The findings of the study differ significantly from the ideals of transparent and agenda-free stakeholder dialogue. Rather, the study shows an overall tension between ideal and practice, supporting the progressive importance of the dialogue process in itself as an essential part of the end goal. The implication of this is a growing pressure on creating transparency about the (re)positioning and negotiation of roles throughout the dialogue process. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Case study; Communication; CSR; Dialogue; Discourse; Foucault; Multi-stakeholder; Tension",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988643445

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative single-case study presents the journey of a supply chain strategy, conceptualised as the idea of transport independence in the Russian Arctic context. Data from 18 semi-structured interviews, personal observations and archival materials are interpreted through the institutional concepts of translation and editing effects. Findings: The study reveals how supply chain strategies evolve over time and can affect institutional factors. The case study further reveals how contextual conditions make a company reconsider its core competencies as well as the role of supply chain management practices. The findings show that strategy implementation through purposeful actions can represent a powerful resistance to contextual pressures and constraints, as well as being a facilitator of change in actual supply chains and their context. During the translation of the idea of transport independence into actions, the supply chain strategy transformed itself into a form of strategic collaboration and thereby made supply chains in the Russian Arctic more integrated than before. Research limitations/implications: More empirical studies on strategy implementation in interaction with contextual and institutional factors are suggested. An institutional process perspective is applied in this study but the authors suggest that future research should include a human dimension by an exploration of day-to-day routines and challenges that employees face when strategising and the actions they take. Originality/value: The study provides an understanding of how a new supply chain strategy emerges and how it changes during implementation. In this process-oriented study – merging context, process and strategy content – it is further shown that a supply chain strategy may affect the context by responding to contextual and institutional challenges. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Arctic shipping; Case study; Process perspective; Strategy implementation; Supply chain management; Translation theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052388806

Electric vehicle aggregators will consequently develop adequate offering strategies to participate in energy and reserve markets, accounting for the market rules and operational capabilities of EVs aggregators (e.g., fleet of EVs). In this paper, we propose an offering strategy model for an EV aggregator to participate in the frequency-controlled normal operation reserve service (FCR-N) in Eastern Denmark. The aim is to maximize the expected revenue of the aggregator, accounting for potential penalties for missing the provision of both upward and downward reserves. The methodology has been modeled and tested under the scope of the PARKER project, which considers a case study based on real data from a small fleet of electric vehicles. An important conclusion relates to the availability patterns of the EVs that significantly changes the strategical participation of the EV aggregator in the service. © 2018 IEEE.","Ancillary services market; Electric vehicles; Stochastic optimization; Vehicle-to-grid","Commerce; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric vehicles; Optimization; Power markets; Vehicle-to-grid; Ancillary services markets; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Normal operations; Operational capabilities; Power systems operation; Stochastic optimizations; Storage capability; Strategy modeling; Fleet operations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055592865

Design/methodology/approach: An online questionnaire was used to elicit information on fish consumption choices among 610 German consumers using a discrete choice experiment. Mixed logit and latent class logit models were used to model consumers’ preference heterogeneity. Findings: Results show that consumers’ preferences for fish attributes such as filets, freshness, ecolabelling and domestic production are heterogeneous and important in consumption choices. The minor share of the respondents is sensitive, while the remaining is indifferent regarding the use of insect based protein as feed in trout production. For this sensitive segment, consumption would be expected to be reduced unless the price is reduced or other attributes such as convenience aspects are improved. Research limitations/implications: The implication is that firms can substitute without a significant impact on the market demand given that the majority of consumers are indifferent regarding feed sources for trout production. As a result, it provides an innovative way to ensure sustainable use of resources and reduces the threat of fish meal trap while reducing pressure on the already over-exploited marine life.

In prior studies, the supply side of remanufacturing supply chain has been vastly brought into focus compared to the demand side. Motivational factors that encourage consumers to purchase remanufactured products are getting firms attentions in developing effective marketing strategies to assist them being more productive in the current competitive market. However, consumer acceptance of remanufactured products has been regarded as one of the main reasons why remanufacturing has remained a majorly untapped opportunity for improving supply chain productivity. This study aims at exploring the major motivational factors for buying a remanufactured bike based on the consumers' and experts' opinions. Firstly, twelve motivations identified by scrutinising the literature. Secondly, single valued trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers (SVTNN) and trapezoidal neutrosophic weighted arithmetic averaging (TNWAA) operator were employed to obtain seven significant motivations using the survey data collected from potential customers. This method is applied owing to its capability in capturing the uncertainty of consumers' subjective judgements. Thirdly, the resulted seven motivations are prioritised in accordance with the experts' judgements utilising a proposed modified fuzzy Delphi (FD) method. Ultimately, the most significant motivation to purchase a remanufactured bike identified as quality that suggests quality is the major factor affecting purchase decision of a remanufactured bike. It indicates remanufacturers should focus on quality and attempt to improve the quality of products to gain more competitive advantage. The other six factors that should be stressed by remanufacturer's marketing strategies are prioritised as warranty, price, information provision, remanufacturer's reputation, value-added services and retailer's reputation respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Consumer behaviour; Fuzzy Delphi; Fuzzy set theory; Neutrosophic set; Purchase motivation; Remanufacturing","Bicycles; Commerce; Competition; Consumer behavior; Motivation; Sales; Strategic planning; Supply chains; Competitive advantage; End-of-life strategies; Fuzzy Delphi; Information provision; Neutrosophic sets; Remanufactured products; Remanufacturing; Remanufacturing supply chains; Fuzzy set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049335082

Therefore, SMEs need to start adopting more environmentally-friendly behaviors to ensure a better future for coming generations. SMEs have failed to do this until now – despite making a significant effort – in part because dealing with this issue is a quite subjective process and a variety of aspects need to be considered. The current study sought to address this problem through the integrated application of cognitive mapping and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Based on a constructivist approach, group sessions involving a panel of entrepreneurs and environmental experts created, tested, and validated a green index for SMEs that addresses two of the major limitations of current evaluation approaches. The first limitation is the manner in which evaluation criteria have been defined within the scope of SME environmental conduct assessments, while the second is the method with which these same criteria's weights – or trade-offs – are calculated. The proposed index produced promising results when used to identify the most environmentally-friendly SMEs in a sample of firms. These results can be used as benchmark data for environmental improvement initiatives, and the findings confirm that the methodologies underlying the proposed model-building process facilitate a clearer understanding of how to evaluate SMEs' pro-environmental behaviors. The advantages and limitations of the proposed index are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive map; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Green index; Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA); SME environmental conduct; Sustainability","Analytic hierarchy process; Cognitive systems; Economic and social effects; Operations research; Sustainable development; Cognitive maps; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Green indices; Multiple criteria decision analysis; SME environmental conduct; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048702282

Then, the authors examine how TMT’s ambiguity tolerance mediates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The authors tested the hypothesis by collecting survey data from 41 TMTs of small- and medium-sized enterprises in the south-east of Iran. Findings: The survey results confirm that a high level of cultural intelligence in TMTs is conducive to corporate entrepreneurship. Furthermore, the result shows that higher levels of cultural intelligence in TMTs relate to a higher level of ambiguity tolerance, which, in turn, enhances the possibility of pursuing corporate entrepreneurship strategy by SMEs. Research limitations/implications: The data for this study were obtained from 41 TMTs in the south-east of Iran, which increases the probability that the results may not be directly transferable to certain companies in Western countries.

Design/methodology/approach: The study employs regulation theory and draws on case studies in Denmark and the UK to understand compliance motivations and, on that basis, to identify the barriers to and enablers of changes to note disclosures in annual reports. Findings: It is demonstrated how certain characteristics of the annual report preparation process can dampen the potential for change. It is also shown how preparer perceptions of oversight agents (auditors, enforcers, audit committees) have effects on disclosure behaviour. These characteristics appear to cause defensiveness among the actors involved in the process, inhibiting changes. In contrast, enablers are related to trust in regulatory enforcement, facilitation from enforcers, user orientation and shared understanding among functional groups involved in the preparation process. Practical implications: The preparation of notes is susceptible to the influence of a range of factors, such as company politics, perceptions of enforcement styles and actors’ concerns about being blamed for inappropriate responses to regulation. These findings could be considered by regulators, auditors and preparers in enhancing understanding of their respective roles in the annual report preparation process.

The UK government regards smart meters to be enablers of a low-carbon energy grid and has set out ambitious consumer-orientated aims within their programme across England, Scotland, and Wales. Despite considerable amount of research on how consumers will (or not) engage with smart meters, media discourses, where some public debates about smart meters are created and reproduced, have received little attention. This paper presents a content analysis of how smart meters are discussed within 11 years of popular print media coverage. A collection of nine discourses are identified: Four of these – “empowered consumers”, “energy conscious world”, “low-carbon grid”, and “future smart innovation” – depict smart meters as a harbinger of positive social change. Five of these – “hacked and vulnerable grid”, “big brother”, “costly disaster”, “astronomical bills”, and “families in turmoil” – represent smart meters as negative forces on society. The results show that discourses and associated storylines mainly represent continuous struggles over particular socio-technical promises linked to smart meters. Somewhat missing are attempts to open up the smart energy debate to broader issues of democracy and energy justice within the print media coverage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy infrastructure; Futures; Media discourses; Smart grid; Smart meters","Carbon; Smart meters; Content analysis; Energy infrastructures; Energy justices; Futures; Low carbon energies; Media discourses; Negative forces; Smart grid; Smart power grids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049316392

The media is being flooded by populist narratives, fake news, conspiracy theories and make-believe. Misinformation is turning into a challenge for all of us, whether politicians, journalists, or citizens. In the age of information, attention is a prime asset and may be converted into money, power, and influence - sometimes at the cost of facts. The point is to obtain exposure on the air and in print media, and to generate traffic on social media platforms. With information in abundance and attention scarce, the competition is ever fiercer with truth all too often becoming the first victim. Reality Lost: Markets of Attention, Misinformation and Manipulation is an analysis by philosophers Vincent F. Hendricks and Mads Vestergaard of the nuts and bolts of the information market, the attention economy and media eco-system which may pave way to postfactual democracy. Here misleading narratives become the basis for political opinion formation, debate, and legislation.

The purpose of this paper is to show what value a football club can provide for sponsors in a context of commercial immaturity with limited expected exposure effects. Design/methodology/approach – The study is based on a case study approach, taking its point of departure in two sponsor brand management paradigms, the projective and relational paradigm. The case of Malmö FF in the Swedish top tier league and the club’s official partners has been chosen to exemplify the commercially immature context. Findings – The study has shown that the most important value the club can provide for sponsors is to act as a mediator in sponsor–stakeholder relations. Exposure effects are subordinate to the relational effects sponsors achieve through their sponsorship. Research limitations/implications – The study indicates that the relational construct in the sponsorship literature should to a greater extent include sponsor–stakeholder relations, beyond the sponsor–club dyad, in a context of commercial immaturity. Practical implications – The results indicate that club management should engage in stakeholder management with a strong focus on stakeholders of sponsors to provide value for these sponsors. Originality/value – This study explores a new dimension to the relational construct of sponsorship, using the relational paradigm of brand management in a context of commercial immaturity. The mediating effect of the club is a contribution to the discourse on the relational construct. © Sven Junghagen.","Football club management; Relationships; Sponsorship; Value creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062046659

This concept has interested researchers for generations. Economists have sought to predict and measure firm growth using a host of different variables, while strategic management scholars depict growth as the result of clever analyses and rational resource exploitation. Entrepreneurship scholars - ever engrossed by successful start-ups - have pondered why growth sometimes comes fast and sometimes never at all, while the field of business history has given countless examples of growing firms in a range of different settings. Yet despite research across fields, our knowledge of how growth in a firm actually comes about is limited and we still know little about the process. This book offers a new reading of economist Edith Penrose's The Theory of the Growth of the Firm. The bold statement is that although Penrose's work - across fields and generations - is amongst the most quoted on firm growth, the basic points of her work have yet to be realized and explored empirically. Essentially, growth is created by a dynamic interrelation between the firm's self-conception and its image of context. Based on these two subjective categories, the firm makes decisions and its actions lead it to develop along a particular path. To Penrose this is the basic engine that drives the growth and development of firms. This book discusses how the engine of firm growth can be captured in empirical analysis using interpretative theory and narrative methods inspired by recent streams of research in business history. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.

The death of Fidel Castro, and the steps taken by Raúl Castro to normalize relations between Cuba and the US, have generated a wave of tourism opportunities. However, deep tensions remain between the Cuban state's centralized socioeconomic model and economic realities. Using the framework of diverse economies, we challenge tourism scholars to unlock the diversity of economies and exchanges that exist, and the Cuban case study in this paper assists in demonstrating why this is important. Within this sensitive political context, we analyse entrepreneurial businesses known as casas particulares, and their broader significance for Cuba's political futures within the framework of diverse economies. In doing so, we tap into debates about diverse economies. Ethnographic fieldwork is conducted in Viñales, a municipality which has experienced tourism growth, and since 1999 has been a UNESCO World Cultural Landscape.

Recent studies have pointed to the impact of the distribution of leadership tasks amongst employees for implementing planned radical changes, yet this lacks examination with regard to hospital mergers. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the emergence of distributed leadership and this leadership’s influence on the implementation of a hospital merger. Design/methodology/approach: The emergence of distributed leadership is examined through a qualitative case study of two Danish hospital units in the context of a large hospital merger. The data consist of 21 interviews and documents collected over a three-year period. Findings: The findings suggest dynamics of widened and restricted distributed leadership being influenced by and influencing the merger at hospital and local-unit levels, respectively. Importantly, the perceived purpose of widened and restricted distributed leadership mediated the actual effects of widened and restricted distributed leadership on the implementation of a merger. Moreover, the findings show that mergers on both the hospital and local level lead to variations in top-down and bottom-up distributed leadership across pre-merger organizational boundaries. Practical implications: Perceived purposeful widening and restriction of distributed leadership at various hospital levels enables merger integration and collaboration across organizational boundaries and hierarchies.

This paper assesses the emergent business model of the Camøno walking trail, which was conceived as an alternative, bottom-up initiative to leverage tourism in Southern Denmark. To understand its rapid uptake and success, we draw on theorizations of value creation in alternative and sharing economies as a reframing process, with due attention to the transformation of non-market resources into commodities (public land, volunteer labour, sense of place). Based on a two-year-long ethnographic fieldwork chronicling the consolidation of the Camøno, we analyze these reframing processes and identify three domains of collaborative governance; the governance of affect, the governance of ownership and the governance of exchange.

Method The authors interviewed 20 emerging and senior leaders using a semistructured interview guide informed by appreciative inquiry. Data were subjected to an inductive qualitative content analysis to identify themes related to qualities, capabilities and learning approaches. Results The qualities identified were clarity of purpose to improve care, endurance, a positive outlook and authenticity. They were considered innate or developed during participants' upbringing. Capabilities were to ground management in medicine, engage others, catalyse systems by acting on interdependencies and employ a scientific approach to understand problems and measure progress. Capabilities were developed through cross-pollination from a diversity of work experiences, reflection, when education was integrated with practice and when their organisational environment nurtured ambition and learning. Conclusions This study reframes current leadership thinking by empirically identifying qualities, capabilities, and learning approaches that can contribute to effective physician leadership. Instead of merely adapting leadership development programmes from other domains, this study suggests there are capabilities unique to effective physician leadership: ground management in medicine and employ a scientific approach to problem identification and solution development.

On one hand, a product’s aesthetic value might increase if its design is separated from technological innovation and if design is controlled by means other than those used in technological innovation. On the other hand, tight integration is warranted because a product’s design affects its cost, technical performance, and manufacturability. This dilemma is the focus of the paper. The paper contributes to extant literature in several ways. First, it conceptualizes control as a process that manages design and technological innovation through distinct, separate control mechanisms. Second, it analyzes and develops three modes of convergence through which the potentially contradictory concerns of design and technological development can be compared and evaluated. Finally, the paper suggests that coordination can be achieved through convergence processes that unfold and develop over time. © 2019, American Accounting Association.

The resource over-allocation causes the schedules not to be applicable in practice. Besides, in real projects, it is hard to predict the duration of activities since they may be changed due to lack of resources, delays in delivering resources, unskilled workers etc. that make activities not to be completed as predicted. Hence, it is important to develop a method that can schedule activities by considering different execution conditions. In this research, we focused on another aspect of solving resource over-allocation problem by considering uncertain activity duration. For this purpose, a mixed integer programming model is developed where the objective function is maximizing net present value of the project while duration of activities are not deterministic. Then a number of examples are solved using a heuristic algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively solve the case studies with no over-allocated resources. Afterward, the algorithm is solved using the data of constructing a hospital. The results reveal that the algorithm can be successfully used for real projects. © 2018 Kharazmi University.

While, generally speaking, German WPF entail risk-reducing benefits for wind power generators, the extent of these benefits across wind farms with different geographical locations remains unclear. In this paper, we consider the wind utilization in thirty-one different locations in Germany. For each site, we propose a copula model for the joint behavior of the site-specific wind index and the overall German wind index. Our results indicate that static mixture copulas are preferred to the stand-alone copula models usually employed in the economic literature. Further, we find evidence of asymmetric dependence and upper tail dependence. To quantify the benefits of WPF at each wind site, we perform a minimum variance hedge and find that variance reductions can differ greatly depending on the geographical location. Different comparison studies reveal that the presence of (1) a negative risk premium in the WPF market and (2) upper tail dependence weaken the benefits of WPF for wind power generators. © 2018 Infopro Digital Risk (IP) Limited.","Copula models; Hedging; Spatial risk; Tail dependence; Wind power futures (WPF); Wind power generation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059821708

This has led to many attempts to measure the economic value of IC. These methods, however, are to some extent questionable and do not seem to be recognized in practice, scholars claim. This might be due to the intangible character of IC. Even though scholars have conducted studies on IC, more research on IC practice and the value creation process with IC is called for; especially in the context of a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME). Based on an empirical and qualitative case study of an SME, the current paper explores the process of IC practice creation and how IC practice is related to value in tangible-intangible dynamics in the SME. The current paper applies practice theorising and the community of practice (CoP) approach to propose how IC practice can create value by integrating intangible knowing about end consumers in the practice of producing tangible output. The empirical results illustrate how establishing communities of practice and fostering knowledge brokers facilitating meaning-negotiating processes is crucial to developing IC practice as intangible assets in the SME, and the paper discusses how making the intangible knowing tangible may increase the value of intangibility in the process of creating IC value and IC practice. © 2018 ACPIL.","communities of practice; intangible assets; Intellectual capital; knowledge brokers; measurement; SME",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056988175

The structural changes underlying these paradoxes are the co-existence of downward pressures on market premiums and the increasing demands on the relational capabilities of port authorities. The increasing demand on relational capabilities is caused by the fact that modern ports are hubs for industrial activities that span the organizational boundaries of firms, integrating port systems and the hinterland. Thus, port authorities must simultaneously focus on cost efficiency and systemic coordination within complex port systems. As indicated by recent research on port governance and competitiveness, this implies that port authorities must assume and combine different organizational roles. The present paper takes this discussion further by classifying the organizational roles of port authorities in terms of role complexity, relational capital, and systemic functions within the port system. Based on a case study, the paper shows that the use of systemic functions implies the development of new business models, and that the adoption of the roles by port authorities depends on how emerging relational capabilities are embedded in structures of value co-creation and value co-capture. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Business model innovation; Port governance; Relational capability; Relational capital; Value co-capture; Value co-creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054557720

Our study contributes to the signaling literature by theorizing about signal incongruence and to infomediary and corporate governance research by showing that media disapproval can lead to lower executive compensation. We also reconcile two conflicting views on firm prosocial behavior by showing that, in the presence of incongruent cues, philanthropy can simultaneously enhance and damage media evaluations of firms and CEOs.

Companies have to account for the fact that any misconduct at a supplier's premises may have spillover effects that reach the manufacturer or retailer. Therefore, purchasing managers have to assure that their suppliers are compliant with sustainability standards. This, however, may induce higher purchasing costs and, as a consequence, force a trade-off between (short term) economic (i.e., purchasing cost reduction) and social/environmental sustainability criteria. How purchasing managers evaluate this trade-off is particularly interesting because they often receive performance-based salaries that incentivize the reduction of purchasing costs. Our paper sheds light on this trade-off by examining how much purchasing managers are willing to pay to assure compliance along different sustainability dimensions when selecting new suppliers in a mature market setting, namely Germany. Additionally, we identify potential (individual, professional, and organization-related) factors that may impact the purchasing managers’ willingness to pay (WTP), and examine their effects. Among the most surprising findings, purchasing managers on average are willing to pay a price premium for manuals that demonstrate compliance with the United Nationals Global Compact (UNGC). Furthermore, the results show that this WTP is mostly influenced (negatively) by self-enhancement (on the individual level) and/or obedience to authority (on the organizational level), but the effects of company, affiliation with the UNGC, gender, or years of experience have no influence. Moreover, the WTP is higher for the social than for the environmental dimension, and the marginal effect of accreditation on WTP depends on which combinations of dimensions are accredited. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Industrial purchasing; Obedience to authority; Supply management; Sustainability; Sustainable sourcing; Triple bottom line; Willingness to pay","Compensation (personnel); Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Managers; Sales; Obedience to authority; Supply management; Sustainable sourcing; Triple Bottom Line; Willingness to pay; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053011706

To a large extent, existing entrepreneurship teaching for creative people is based on a traditional administrative management logic that often results in a clash between entrepreneurial demands and creative identities. The paper is based on the following rationale: the better we understand designers' reasoning and their struggles concerning becoming entrepreneurs, the better we are able to design entrepreneurship learning experiences that meet their needs. Since designers' career-making tends to be highly driven by their strong sense of identity, the paper takes an identity perspective. The empirical foundation of the research is based on observation studies and phenomenological interviews conducted during an eight-week entrepreneurship training program.

This paper explores this issue by comparing knowledge-intensive entrepreneurship (KIE) in the manufacturing and creative industries by examining their differences and similarities. Given the lack of prior studies, our comparison is exploratory and based on descriptive statistics. We use survey data that comes from a large-scale Eurupean Union research project (AEGIS) which studied KIE firms across 10 countries and a diverse set of industries. Our analysis shows that KIE firms in creative industries resemble those in manufacturing in several dimensions, but also that there are some pronounced differences, such as (i) a higher level of knowledge intensity of KIE firms in creative industries, with higher educational attainment of both founders and employees; (ii) that personal financing plays a much larger role in creative industries; (iii) KIE in creative industries focuses more on service innovations, but introduces radical innovations to a lesser extent; and (iv) they remain smaller in terms of number of employees and turnover, but are more profitable than KIE in manufacturing relative to their size.

We start from the widely accepted view that distant, externally-developed knowledge is difficult to absorb into the focal firm's own knowledge production. We suggest that high levels of intrafirm inventor task network diversity and task network density are essential for a diversity of knowledge inputs and coordinated actions regarding knowledge transfer, which in turn, reduces problems related to the absorption of knowledge—especially in the case of knowledge that is distant from the focal firm. The results of an event history study of 113 pharmaceutical firms that engaged in technology in-licensing from 1986 to 2003 provide general support for our hypotheses. Managerial Summary: Firms keen to keep up with an uncertain and ever-changing industry environment, can benefit from the speedy introduction of inventions. We examine how firms absorb licensed-in technologies to nurture the rapid development of own related inventions. We show that a firm's absorption speed depends on the characteristics of the internal collaboration networks among the firm's inventor employees. More specifically, technologically diverse and well-connected inventor networks improve the firm's ability to absorb external technologies quickly. This applies especially to externally acquired technologies that are unfamiliar to the firm. Depending on the distance of the acquired technology from the focal firm combined with speed-inducing inventor network characteristics, our estimates suggest that firms can reduce the time needed for absorption by several months.

When technology records employees' work automatically, information quality is ensured by algorithms that produce electronic representations of work. What happens when employees report their own work? We show that the quality of this self-reported information depends on how managers direct their employees to report their work in their organization's information systems. We refer to constructing this representation as transfiguration work. We draw on a 15-month ethnography to specify the process of transfiguration work along with the characteristics of the system of transfiguration that supports it. Our specification of transfiguration work supplements the model of representation implicit in research on management information systems. We show how managers can take over information technology in enforcing the practices that employees follow to report their work. By doing so, we theorize a broader role for agency in the representation of work. We conclude that organizations can improve the quality of data in their information systems by shaping how managers enforce transfiguration work, rather than by changing the information systems where employees report their work. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Study 1 develops a measure of IT mindfulness and evaluates its validity and reliability. Study 2 employs a laboratory experiment to examine whether IT mindfulness can be manipulated and whether its influence is consistent across technological contexts. Study 3 places IT mindfulness in a nomological network and tests the construct's utility for predicting more active system use (e.g., trying to innovate and deep structure usage) as well as more automatic system use (e.g., continuance intention). Our primary contribution includes the development and validation of a scale for IT mindfulness. In addition, we demonstrate that IT mindfulness (1) differs from important existing concepts such as cognitive absorption, (2) can be manipulated, (3) more closely relates to active system use than automatic system use, and (4) provides more predictive power within the IS context than general trait mindfulness. © 2018 University of Minnesota.

Missing from existing research is an analysis of the degree of novelty of service innovations introduced by manufacturing companies. Therefore, this article shifts the focus from the transition process itself to the question of how manufacturing companies can introduce radical service innovations to the market. This article links servitization literature with service innovation literature and investigates how manufacturing companies can introduce radically new services in terms of three forms of innovations: service concept innovations, customer experience innovations, and service process innovations. Service-dominant logic (SDL) is applied as the theoretical lens because it covers four significant factors influencing the success of companies’ innovation activities: actor value networks, resource liquefaction, resource density, and resource integration. Based on a multiple case study of 24 Danish business-to-business manufacturing small- and medium-sized enterprises and through a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, different configurations of the principles of SDL are analyzed. They describe the paths to radical service innovation. Digitalization appears as a central causal condition in the bulk of the configurations. Big and rich data generated internally within the focal company in combination with for instance customer data can enhance the innovativeness of the service offerings. However, digitalization is not a sufficient condition for launching radical service innovation—it should be combined with an efficient mobilization of resources internally within the focal company and/or collaboration with other organizations within the value system. In addition, the analysis hints to a need to detach from immediate customers as the prime driver of service innovation. © 2018 Product Development & Management Association",,"Computer circuits; Manufacture; Sales; Business to business; Customer experience; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Manufacturing companies; Multiple-case study; Resource integration; Service-dominant Logic; Small and medium sized enterprise; Industrial research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050538676

We put forward the argument here that as critical scholars we simply cannot allow ourselves to be swept up in the bien-pensant tide of Trump-trashing, which has almost become as addictive as the current reality-TV quality of the US presidency itself. As Roitman has suggested in a different context, ‘the concept of crisis is crucial to the “how” of thinking otherwise’. Thus, we believe it crucial to seize the crisis of the Trump presidency as an opportunity to activate the utopian imagination, rather than an occasion for moralizing judgements or regressive nostalgia which would effectively mean aligning ourselves with the neo-liberal consensus many of us spent our careers critiquing. We further argue that Fredric Jameson’s notion of the dialectic may refresh our critical conceptual arsenal in these disorienting times. This dialectical approach is meant to alter not only how we see reality, but also what we think we can do with it. It enables us to see the traumatic event of Trump’s election as providing a form and space through which contradictions that have been locked firmly into place in our socioeconomic set-up over the past few decades have become much more malleable, partly because of their increased visibility. © The Author(s) 2018.","Dialectic; future; Jameson; populism; Trump; utopia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050207099

The data employed in this paper was collected in 2012 from production/technology/plant managers of Danish manufacturing companies. As a result, taxonomy of the evolution of AMT investment patterns is presented in this paper; contextual factors including size and industry type are also considered to investigate their association with AMT investment patterns over time; and the relationship between performance improvement and evolution of AMT investment patterns is finally elaborated. The major theoretical contributions of this paper are addressing the dynamic nature of AMT investment, examining how companies change their patterns of AMT investment over time, and developing further understandings on the evolution of AMT investment patterns per se, as well as its relationships with industry, company size, and performance improvement. Meanwhile, this paper suggests industrial managers to be aware of ever evolving technological developments and understand their own business goals before investing in AMTs, as different ways to evolve AMT investment patterns correlate with diverse performance gains. Moreover, the paper also recommends industrial managers to be patient in order to reap benefits of their AMT investments, as there is an inevitable time interval between AMT investment and its desired performance effects. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AMT; Evolution; Investment pattern; Longitudinal; Taxonomy","Managers; Manufacture; Taxonomies; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Evolution; Longitudinal; Longitudinal analysis; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing operations; Performance improvements; Technological development; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049890384

We uncover the cognitive and emotional processes individuals experience that enable them to begin disrupting the gender institution, within our case context of a gender equality programme in the Ghanaian cocoa value chain. We identify four elements of institutional apprehension: theorizing, auditing, relating to others and exploring difference. These processes help individuals ‘see’ the dimensions of the gender institution: its order’s laws and rules, its organizational gender regimes, and its gendered practices in daily interactions. Furthermore, some individuals are able to appreciate the dynamic interplay between these dimensions, and the power relations that are inherent within them. We argue that this fifth element of institutional apprehension, consciousness-raising, is particularly important for achieving equality. Consciousness-raising involves connecting everyday practices with organizational and structural rules, thus making ‘the personal political’. It enables individuals to reconsider the way that power plays out in relational ways within value chains, promoting variously fatalism, resistance and the possibility of more multidimensional solutions to gender inequality. © The Author(s) 2018.","consciousness-raising; gender inequality; gender institution; global value chains; institutional work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049864886

New drive systems or lightweight-design of cars often imply an environmental burden shifting from one life cycle stage to another, e.g. from the use-stage to the manufacturing stage. More products will be manufactured for an increasing population and higher efficiency effort may lead to increased consumption (rebound effect). An optimization of the manufacturing stage is thus increasingly important but it has to be done from the perspective of bringing the product's life cycle performance in accordance with sustainability requirements. In order to support the companies in finding effective solutions, the framework “Sustainability Cone” was applied and an algorithm developed guiding the definition of economic and environmental target states (TS) in automotive manufacturing. Especially during the early phase of planning, largest improvements can be achieved, however target states are not yet integrated in production simulation software (e.g. PLM tools). This paper describes the approach and its application in the planning of a body shop, being one of the most relevant and complex steps of car production. The approach addresses all relevant levels, e.g. a robot, a production cell and the entire production line. So-called life cycle targets (LCT) are introduced, which represent a specific share of the target state, reflecting the importance (i.e. activity-based) of each level. Using this approach, a product and production system can be planned holistically and any rebound effect factored in and sub-optimization can be avoided. © 2018","Automation; Life cycle assessment; Manufacturing; Production planning; Sustainability; Target setting","Automation; Automobile manufacture; Computer software; Economics; Manufacture; Production control; Sustainable development; Automotive manufacturing; Car body manufacturing; Environmental burdens; Environmental targets; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle performance; Production Planning; Target setting; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048208235

However, recent environmental challenges such as global warming and climate change has strongly been affected by the high volumes of chemical pesticides and fertilizers used to produce these products. Several published reports have indicated the negative effects of the chemicals used in conventional agriculture as well as the effect of climate change on human health. The aim of this study is to develop and analyze a multi-objective linear mathematical model for a sustainable supply chain with an agro-food deteriorating product. The product is produced by two different methods, both by organic and conventional means. In this way, we attempt to create a balance between the production and consumption of conventional and organic products in order to achieve three objectives: reducing costs, reducing environmental degradation, and increasing levels of consumer health. Partial backorder for each product, as well as conventional demand substitution by organic products, are taken into account. In order to assess the impact of supply chain operations on public health, we define a new function based on each product's production and consumption amounts as well as the amount of wastes. The developed model is solved by augmented ɛ-constraint method. Numerical results indicate the important role of supply chain's managers in the formation of sustainable health production and consumption patterns. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Deterioration; Organic and conventional agricultural products; Partial backorder; Substitution; Sustainable supply chains","Agricultural products; Climate change; Deterioration; Food products; Global warming; Public health; Substitution reactions; Supply chains; Conventional agricultures; Deteriorating products; Environmental challenges; Global warming and climate changes; Partial backorder; Production and consumption; Supply chain operation; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047408702

These risks share the prospect of causing outright human extinction were they to occur. In this approach, such identified existential risks are frequently characterised by relatively singular origin events and concrete pathways of harm which directly jeopardise the survival of humanity, or undercut its potential for long-term technological progress. While this approach aptly identifies the most cataclysmic fates which may befall humanity, we argue that catastrophic ‘existential outcomes’ may likely arise from a broader range of sources and societal vulnerabilities, and through the complex interactions of disparate social, cultural, and natural processes—many of which, taken in isolation, might not be seen to merit attention as a global catastrophic, let alone existential, risk. This article argues that an emphasis on mitigating the hazards (discrete causes) of existential risks is an unnecessarily narrow framing of the challenge facing humanity, one which risks prematurely curtailing the spectrum of policy responses considered. Instead, it argues existential risks constitute but a subset in a broader set of challenges which could directly or indirectly contribute to existential consequences for humanity. To illustrate, we introduce and examine a set of existential risks that often fall outside the scope of, or remain understudied within, the field. By focusing on vulnerability and exposure rather than existential hazards, we develop a new taxonomy which captures factors contributing to these existential risks. Latent structural vulnerabilities in our technological systems and in our societal arrangements may increase our susceptibility to existential hazards. Finally, different types of exposure of our society or its natural base determine if or how a given hazard can interface with pre-existing vulnerabilities, to trigger emergent existential risks. We argue that far from being peripheral footnotes to their more direct and immediately terminal counterparts, these “Boring Apocalypses” may well prove to be the more endemic and problematic, dragging down and undercutting short-term successes in mitigating more spectacular risks. If the cardinal concern is humanity's continued survival and prosperity, then focussing academic and public advocacy efforts on reducing direct existential hazards may have the paradoxical potential of exacerbating humanity's indirect susceptibility to such outcomes. Adopting law and policy perspectives allow us to foreground societal dimensions that complement and reinforce the discourse on existential risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Boring Apocalypse; Civilisational collapse; Existential Risks; Exposure; Vulnerability","artificial intelligence; catastrophic event; civilization; risk assessment; typology; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046861602

The attainment of this goal requires the continuous development of container ports’ performance, better customer satisfaction and - at the same time - to deter the occurrence of waste and bottleneck. Many regions in Europe are shifting from a single-port to a multi-port gateway situation; their ports frequently have overlapping hinterlands and are therefore increasingly facing competition and rivalry between each other. This paper examines container ports located in six countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK. It focuses on sensitivities to the inclusion of country-specific measurements on logistics service delivery performance outcomes on port efficiency. Port efficiency is measured with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results suggest that: (1) efficiency measurements for Danish, Finnish, Swedish and British ports are heavily influenced by whether logistics service delivery outcomes are included or not; (2) Icelandic and Norwegian ports appear to be not sensitive to whether logistics service delivery outcomes are included or not; (3) on average, the container ports located in countries that are directly called by deep-sea transcontinental container liners are over-performers and under-performers with regard to technical efficiency and scale efficiency, respectively. We further apply a second-stage regression analysis to explain the impact of country-specific contextual factors on DEA-based efficiency scores. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Container ports; DEA; Freight connectivity; Logistics performance; Port efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044920234

Analyzing a 3 years panel dataset of German manufacturing firms obtained from Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) database, we find that knowledge-related obstacles induce firms to increase the scale of R&D outsourcing as well as to engage in innovation cooperation partnerships. Contrariwise, a non-significant relationship is detected between economic related innovation impediments and R&D openness.

In a growing number of cases, citizens use social media platforms to self-organize and carry out tasks in emergencies that potentially challenge or complement official emergency response. During the 2013 floods in Dresden, Germany, several Facebook groups emerged as a primary means for citizens to gather and share information about the emergency. These networks enabled the emergence of what is here called the “switchboard mechanism,” whereby citizens in need of help could be connected to those offering it. Moreover, the online activity helped to create a sense of common purpose among volunteers. In combination with ethnographic research, this article provides an analysis of one of the Facebook groups by categorizing different posts according to their function to examine how such online networks are used to translate online activity into on-the-ground emergency response by citizens. The switchboard mechanism is thus an attempt to add to a conceptual apparatus for research into the ways that such online–offline translations occur during disasters. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","disaster response; emergence; Facebook; self-organization; volunteers","conceptual framework; disaster management; ethnography; flood; information; self organization; social media; voluntary approach; Dresden; Germany; Saxony",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028613644

This study proposes a unique typology for outside-in innovations based on two distinct ways of boundary spanning: whether an innovation idea is created internally or externally and whether an innovation process relies on external knowledge resources. This yields four possible types of innovation, which represent the nuanced variation of outside-in innovations. Using historical data from Canada for 1945–1980, this study unveils different implications of these innovation types for different levels of innovation novelty. Copyright © 2016 ASAC.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze ECM case reports from practice to identify ECM’s objectives, processes and technologies and to provide a foundation on which ECM can be conceptualized and defined. Design/methodology/approach: This paper assembles more than 1,200 case reports on industrial ECM implementations in order to characterize the ECM concept from a practitioner’s viewpoint. The paper provides a descriptive overview and historical examination of ECM implementations over time and across countries and industries, grounded in a structured content analysis. Findings: Even though the case reports share some commonalities, their ECM projects differ considerably in terms of their objectives, processes and technologies, and vary widely across countries and industries. In addition, ECM implementations are much broader today than they once were, so the scope and boundaries of the ECM concept are increasingly blurred in practice. Originality/value: While several researchers have characterized the ECM concept based on literature reviews, only a few have approached the definition problem from a practical viewpoint. This paper provides a foundation from which to evaluate how well researchers’ conceptualizations of ECM match current business practice. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Content management; Document management; Enterprise content management",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052687539

Design/methodology/approach: The performance is evaluated through a discrete event simulation model, which mirrors a part of one of Norway’s largest grocery retailer and uses their POS data to reflect a realistic demand pattern of 232 stores for one year. Findings: The findings indicate that a current age-based replenishment policy (EWA policy) provides a significant improvement of 17.7 percent increase in availability for perishables with a shelf life between 4 and 11 days, but suffers from high inventory levels and only reduces waste by 3.4 percent compared to a base stock policy. A proposed adjustment to the EWA policy, EWASS, provides a more balanced performance in the conducted study with a reduction of 10.7 percent waste and 10.3 percent increase in availability by keeping the same average inventory level. Practical implications: Sharing and utilizing RSL information for replenishment of perishables with a predetermined shelf life between 6 and 11 days can be beneficial, and could enable the replenishment processes to be automated. However, for products with longer shelf life, the benefits slowly diminish. Originality/value: The study proposes a new age-based replenishment policy which in the conducted study showed a more balanced performance improvement, in both waste and availability, compared with previous replenishment policies. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Information sharing; Replenishment; Shelf life; Simulation","article; Norway; shelf life; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052432399

The networks of partners in professional service firms are thought to be important for knowledge exploration because they typically span both the firm's internal and external boundaries aiding the flow of novel information to the firm. Yet, to date prior studies of individual-level boundary spanning have focused primarily on the benefits of boundary spanning and only recently begun to address the costs of building and maintaining boundary spanning ties. We add to this stream of research and propose that the knowledge exploration benefits of internal boundary spanning ties accrue more slowly than the costs, resulting in a curvilinear relationship with knowledge exploration. Moreover, we propose that the effects of internal and external boundary spanning ties on exploration are interdependent, because effective exploration requires not only the selection of ideas externally, but also their transmission internally. Our study of 1,449 ties of partners in a consulting firm supports these arguments providing a more nuanced view of boundary spanning ties for knowledge exploration in professional service firms. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

Three literatures, in particular, have made important contributions: neo-institutional approaches to the re-scaling of professional organizational fields; Bourdieusian approaches to inter- and transnational fields of expert power; and approaches deploying Andrew Abbott's notion of linked ecologies in analyzing transnational expert politics. In reviewing these debates, this article makes the case that Abbott's core topological notion of 'ecology' - understood as differentiated and competitive arenas for professional claims- and alliance-making - has certain advantages when it comes to re-scaling and specifying the trans-local character of many contemporary professional projects. In particular, the article argues, this notion allows the analyst to view issues of spatialization and scale-making, and hence the making, linking, and boundary-drawing of specific expert jurisdictions, as themselves major issues of negotiation and struggle for contemporary professional groups. This conceptual and methodological argument is fleshed out in the article in relation to an on-going comparative research project on how professional groups in Denmark compete and cooperate for local organizational change in relation to border-transcending challenges of climate adaptation, lifestyle-related diseases, and economic innovation. By mapping the three case histories in terms of their patterns of local-transnational relations, the article ends by specifying some of the methodological challenges for a qualitative and comparative study aiming to capture emerging and variable modalities of trans-local professional projects. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

It brings together a range of relationships across people, sea, and energy, from developers to local communities and policymakers. This calls for diverse approaches, moving beyond an oppositional mindset to one that can establish an inclusive community around MRE development. Ownership of the marine environment is a legal issue, but MRE devices operate within a cultural and emotional sense of place. Early, sustained community engagement and advocacy is crucial to developing an industry whose impacts are likely to be felt before its social benefits materialise. Crucially, local communities could be supported by Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) research in creating new mythologies and imaginaries through which MRE technologies become an integral part of their culture, as well as part of their biophysical environment. A complex physical, political, and legal environment provides the context for these new marine energy technologies, and its development provides opportunities for SSH research to address issues around the sea and to integrate into the design of new marine energy seascapes. © The Author(s) 2018.

In the framework, a four-dimensional assessment system that can incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria from the environmental, economic, social-political, and technical concerns was firstly established. Subsequently, a hybrid Entropy-FANP method was employed to determine the criteria's weight by combining the objective data and subjective opinions; a novel PRSRV approach was developed to rigorously rank the alternative routes by aggregating the absolute sustainability performance and relative sustainability balance of each alternative. The proposed framework was applied to prioritize five promising low-carbon routes for ammonia production, i.e. wind turbine electrolysis (WGEA), solar photovoltaic electrolysis (PVEA), hydropower electrolysis (HPEA), biomass gasification electrolysis (BGEA), and nuclear high temperature electrolysis (NTEA), yielding the sustainability ranking of HPEA > BGEA > WGEA > PVEA > NTEA. The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed framework were verified by conducting the sensitivity analysis and comparing the results determined by the proposed framework with those determined using the previous approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Combined weights; Criteria system; Low-carbon ammonia production; PRSRV method; Sustainability prioritization","Ammonia; Carbon; Electrolysis; Low temperature production; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Transportation routes; Wind turbines; Combined weights; Criteria systems; Low carbon; Prioritization; PRSRV method; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048159651

Consistent with recent research on the effects of business network formation, this paper finds that participation in the Innovation Network increases labor productivity and total factor productivity by almost 7 and 13 percent respectively after four years. In addition, participants in the Innovation Network program are about 5 percentage points more likely to participate in other Danish innovation programs in the subsequent four years, explaining one mechanism by which the Innovation Network facilitates productivity growth. Generally, those firms with lower than (industry) median levels of full time equivalent employees realize the largest benefits from program participation. Despite small sample sizes, evidence that particular networks experience even larger gains is presented. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cluster; Denmark; innovation; matching; network; productivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029606361

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis based literature review of 38 selected research articles, published between 2000 and 2016, was used to create an overview of data capture, technologies used for collection and sharing of data, and decision making that can be supported by the data, across the cold chain and for different types of perishable food products. Findings: There is a need to understand how continuous monitoring of conditions such as temperature, humidity, and vibration can be translated to support real-time assessment of quality, determination of actual remaining shelf life of products and use of those for decision making in cold chains. Firms across the cold chain need to adopt appropriate technologies suited to the specific contexts to capture data across the cold chain. Analysis of such data over longer periods can also unearth patterns of product deterioration under different transportation conditions, which can lead to redesigning the transportation network to minimize quality loss or to take precautions to avoid the adverse transportation conditions. Research limitations/implications: The findings need to be validated through further empirical research and modeling. There are opportunities to identify all relevant parameters to capture product condition as well as transaction data across the cold chain processes for fish, meat and dairy products. Such data can then be used for supply chain (SC) planning and pricing products in the retail stores based on product conditions and traceability information. Addressing some of the above research gaps will call for multi-disciplinary research involving food science and engineering, information technologies, computer science and logistics and SC management scholars. Practical implications: The findings of this research can be beneficial for multiple players involved in the cold chain like food processing companies, logistics service providers, ports and wholesalers and retailers to understand how data can be effectively used for better decision making in cold chain and to invest in the specific technologies, which will suit the purpose. To ensure adoption of data analytics across the cold chain, it is also important to identify the player in the cold chain, which will drive and coordinate the effort. Originality/value: This paper is one of the earliest to recognize the need for a comprehensive assessment for adoption and application of data analytics in cold chain management and provides directions for future research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Asia; Cold chain; Content analysis based; Data analytics; ICT infrastructure; Literature review; Logistics",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048062141

Furthermore, the purpose was to investigate whether the applied approach led to enhanced perception of professional identity and new understandings of employability for students in the internship course. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research design was the basis for investigation of the topics in focus. The data consisted of five focus groups, observation notes, and documentation from the exam situations. Two consecutive groups of students (2015 and 2016) participated in the study at a university of applied science in Denmark. Findings: Results from the study provided evidence that students in internships collectively develop a comprehensive understanding of how to apply theory to practical settings. By working with an entrepreneurial learning approach in the professional practice, students reported an enhanced reflective understanding of learning outcomes and the theory-practice gap, developed an ability for opportunity identification, and established a grounded feeling of professional identity and employability. Practical implications: The current pilot project serves as a full and context-rich case study that can inform educators about formative and summative assessment practices when designing internships courses. Furthermore, internship supervisors can get valuable insight into learning processes during an internship. Originality/value: The suggested model for an entrepreneurial learning approach to assessment of internships provides a basis for further research within entrepreneurial learning and the application to design of assessment practices in this context. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Assessment; Assessment practice; Entrepreneurship education; Internship; Learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035002897

Hence, the antecedents for successful venture management are yet to be fully explored and our study contributes to this effort. The study shows that corporate venture success is enhanced when corporate management grants job and strategic autonomy to the venture managers. This is further amplified when corporate management simultaneously imposes an exploitative policy that forces venture managers to prioritize extensions to and improvements of existing competences and product-market offerings. © 2018 IEEE.","autonomy; corporate policy; corporate ventures; corporation-venture relations; organiztational ambidexterity","Managers; Mergers and acquisitions; autonomy; Corporate management; Corporate policies; Corporate ventures; Corporate venturing; Medium sized enterprise; organiztational ambidexterity; Strategic autonomies; Engineering research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052542023

To address this gap, we present a screening-level substitution framework to compare and rank pesticides using a consistent set of indicators including registration, pest resistance, human toxicity and aquatic ecotoxicity impact potentials, and market price. Toxicity-related damage costs and application costs were combined with application dosages to yield total costs per pesticide. We applied and tested our framework in a case study on pesticides applied to lettuce in Denmark. Our results indicate that by ranking pesticides within each target class (e.g. fungicides) the most suitable pesticide can be identified based on our set of indicators. As an example, in the insecticide scenario, pymetrozine performs best with total costs of 23 €/ha, while dimethoate and pirimicarb, which are also on the EU candidate substitution list, performed worst. Total costs across considered pesticides range from 23 to 302 €/ha. Our framework constitutes an operational starting point for identifying sustainable pesticides by farmers and other stakeholders and highlights (a) the need to consider various relevant aspects influencing the ranking of pesticides and (b) the importance of combining total cost performance per pesticide unit applied with respective application dosage per hectare as both may vary greatly. Future research should focus on considering additional indicators (e.g. terrestrial ecotoxicity), increasing resistance-related data, and reducing uncertainty that is mainly related to emission and toxicity impact estimates. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decision support; Environmental impacts; Pesticide ranking; Substitution scenarios","Agriculture; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Toxicity; Uncertainty analysis; Application cost; Aquatic ecotoxicity; Cost performance; Decision supports; Human toxicity; Pest resistance; Screening level; Target class; Pesticides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053129140

Due to the uncertainty and ambiguity involved, key performance indicators (KPIs) used for incremental innovation projects are often not useful in this context. The purpose of this paper is to explore suitable KPIs particularly useful for radical innovation projects. Design/methodology/approach: This study first reviews commonly used measures for innovation projects, which is then followed by case-study evidence from three industry-leading international firms. This study includes 13 in-depth interviews with innovation managers and directors in these firms, providing insights on how they measure the progress and performance of radical innovation projects. Findings: KPIs used commonly in incremental innovation showed lackluster results in the case firms and were problematic for radical innovation context. A key finding was that radical innovation project performance should be evaluated based on the process rather than on the expected outcome. Concurrently, based on the literature review and the cases, three sets of KPIs with 13 specific KPIs useful for radical innovation projects are proposed.

Survey responses were combined with actual purchase data among the same respondents and thereby providing information about the respondents’ share of organic consumption. Findings: No consumer segment differentiated between pesticide-free, cisgenic bread and conventional alternatives. Conventional consumers preferred cisgenics over transgenics, while pesticide-free is not highly valued. Frequent organic consumers were having willingness-to-pay (WTP) a large premium for organic, indicating that they will continue to purchase such products even if cisgenic, pesticide-free products are introduced.

This political order diverges not only from Western democratic values, but also from the general reform trend of the Deng Xiaoping era. During the 1980s, Deng promoted the separation of “Party and government” and “government and business” in an attempt to avoid the CPC “taking on and intervening in everything”. The article details how this reform trend has been reversed under Xi Jinping. Instead of notions of separation, the dominant slogan is “bidirectional entry and cross appointment”. Thus, in many localities, the Party secretary also serves as chairman of the local national people’s congress and in state-owned companies, the Party secretary duplicates as chairman of the board. The article also shows how the Party has strengthened its authority and centralised power in the hands of Xi Jinping. The result is the fusion of Party and state or what can be called the transition from Party-state to state-Party. © 2018, National University of Singapore.

Specifically, we theorize that because different infomediaries are situated in different thought worlds, CEOs' use of metaphorical communication has contradictory effects on journalists' and securities analysts' evaluations: while it triggers more favorable statements from journalists, it prompts more unfavorable assessments from analysts. Moreover, we integrate findings from cognitive psychology to argue that these contradictory effects increase the more a firm's performance falls behind market expectations. Our hypotheses find support in an extensive analysis of 937 quarterly earnings calls in the U.S. pharmaceutical, hardware, and software industries, and of journalists' statements and analysts' earnings forecasts and recommendations. Our novel theorizing and findings suggest that the use of discursive frames, especially in the form of metaphorical communication, in firms' interactions with critical audiences creates thought-provoking and thus-far neglected dilemmas.

In this paper, we address two questions. First, does it matter who communicates an unfair decision? Second, does it matter how the unfair decision is communicated? We conduct a modified dictator game experiment in which either the decision maker or a spokesperson communicates the decided allocation to recipients, who then determine whether to punish either of them. We find that receivers punish both the decision maker and the spokesperson more often, and more heavily, for unfair allocations communicated by the spokesperson if there is room for shifting blame. The increased punishment results from the messenger’s style of delivery: spokespersons are more likely than decision makers to express emotional regret instead of rational need. Receivers seem to punish the former style of communication because they view it as an attempt to shift blame. Our results establish more generally that the design of communication schemes shapes relationships among organizational members. © 2017 INFORMS.","Communication; Delegation; Dictator game; Experiment; Punishment","Communication; Experiments; Management; Operations research; Communication schemes; Decision makers; Delegation; Dictator games; Experimental evidence; Punishment; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051397993

Through comparison between Lao and variations of Confucian social capital, we identified a number of distinctive features of Lao social capital (teun tang sangkhom) which delineate it from guanxi and other concepts identified in the literature. We argue that Lao social capital is not merely a new label for old concepts in the Western or guanxi literature, but rather is a uniquely evolved artefact of Lao society and thus represents a new distinct concept in the literature.

First, a move away from viewing conflict as dysfunctional to viewing it as constructive. Second, a shift from normative prescriptions to descriptions of what disputants do in conflict. Third, a shift from psychological functional analyses to studying conflict as an organizational phenomenon. We find that three distinct and essentially contested conceptions frame studies of conflict at work: conflict as a distinct behavioral phenomenon, conflict as an instrumental means of achieving something else, and conflict as a social construction contingent on how reality is perceived.

The elastic modulus, strength and Poisson's ratio at different build and print orientations are obtained by performing uniaxial tensile tests. Based on the results, an appropriate material model is formed and validated by conducting flexural tests on a flat and curved layer FDM (CLFDM) parts fabricated in various print and build orientations. It is found that the influence of the print orientation or different raster angle is minimal and an averaged isotropic material model can be used to simulate parts in a particular build orientation. The build orientation influences the elastic mechanical response of the flat and CLFDM parts largely. A case study on a flying wing unmanned aerial vehicle (FW-UAV) is presented to analyze the contribution of the build orientation on the strength of the structure. The case study shows that the effect of build orientation in some instances might not be critical and a thorough understanding of the loads interacting with the part is necessary before analyzing the building parameters. © 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Finite element analysis; Fused deposition modeling; Mechanical behaviour; Taguchi and ANOVA analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicles","3D printers; Antennas; Deposition; Fabrication; Finite element method; Layered manufacturing; Tensile testing; ANOVA analysis; Appropriate materials; Building parameters; Fused deposition modeling; Isotropic materials; Mechanical behaviour; Mechanical response; Uniaxial tensile test; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050133177

Integrating transformational leadership, public service motivation (PSM), and self-determination theory, this article sheds light on the psychological mechanisms underlying the motivational effects of transformational leadership. According to structural equation modeling, the relationships between transformational leadership and two types of autonomous work motivation—intrinsic motivation and PSM—are mediated by the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Our findings support the claim that the motivational effects of transformational leadership are mediated by need satisfaction, but also that satisfaction of individual needs is not equally important for intrinsic motivation and PSM, respectively. © 2017, The Author(s) 2017.","basic need satisfaction; intrinsic motivation; public service motivation; transformational leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049909237

This article contributes by emphasizing an individual perspective of engagement and by providing empirical evidence of links between professionalism and engagement. Additionally, by focusing on relatively low-educated employees, the article highlights how professionalism challenges the perception of caregiving as a job rather than a career.

Remanufacturing capacity is assumed as a stochastic variable. Under the uncertainty of remanufacturing capacity, it is possible that some inspected and eligible items could not be processed. If a bought item could not be processed, it should be salvaged at low prices and be considered a lost profit. In such situations, increasing the number of returned obsolete products is suitable where there is a high probability for enough capacity in the remanufacturing process. In this study, a stochastic model is developed to find the optimal paid reward to customers under both scenarios, including decentralized (where the retailer decides independently on reward amount) and centralized (where reward amount is determined based on the whole channel interest). By sharing the manufacturer's capacity risk, a revenue sharing contract is proposed to convince the retailer to consider uncertainty of remanufacturing capacity in deciding reward amount. Under the proposed contract, a part of retailer revenue is postponed until the remanufacturing process is completed. Non-eligible items, as well as those that cannot be processed due to insufficient capacity are not involved in revenue sharing with the retailer. Our numerical investigations reveal that the proposed scheme is able to coordinate the investigated RSC under the uncertainty of remanufacturing capacity. Contrary to the decentralized scenario, the proposed model recommends fewer paid rewards to customers when there is a high possibility of insufficient capacity in the remanufacturing process. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Obsolete product; Reverse supply chain; Stochastic remanufacturing capacity; Supply chain coordination","Manufacture; Sales; Stochastic systems; Supply chains; Numerical investigations; Obsolete products; Remanufacturing process; Revenue sharing contracts; Reverse supply chains; Stochastic remanufacturing capacity; Stochastic variable; Supply chain coordination; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048173194

This target has wide-ranging implications for Europe and its cities, which are the source of substantial greenhouse gas emissions. This paper reports the state of local planning for climate change by collecting and analysing information about local climate mitigation and adaptation plans across 885 urban areas of the EU-28. A typology and framework for analysis was developed that classifies local climate plans in terms of their alignment with spatial (local, national and international) and other climate related policies. Out of eight types of local climate plans identified in total we document three types of stand-alone local climate plans classified as type A1 (autonomously produced plans), A2 (plans produced to comply with national regulations) or A3 (plans developed for international climate networks). There is wide variation among countries in the prevalence of local climate plans, with generally more plans developed by central and northern European cities. Approximately 66% of EU cities have a type A1, A2, or A3 mitigation plan, 26% an adaptation plan, and 17% a joint adaptation and mitigation plan, while about 33% lack any form of stand-alone local climate plan (i.e. what we classify as A1, A2, A3 plans). Mitigation plans are more numerous than adaptation plans, but planning for mitigation does not always precede planning for adaptation. Our analysis reveals that city size, national legislation, and international networks can influence the development of local climate plans. We found that size does matter as about 80% of the cities with above 500,000 inhabitants have a comprehensive and stand-alone mitigation and/or an adaptation plan (A1). Cities in four countries with national climate legislation (A2), i.e. Denmark, France, Slovakia and the United Kingdom, are nearly twice as likely to produce local mitigation plans, and five times more likely to produce local adaptation plans, compared to cities in countries without such legislation. A1 and A2 mitigation plans are particularly numerous in Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Finland; while A1 and A2 adaptation plans are prevalent in Denmark, Finland, UK and France. The integration of adaptation and mitigation is country-specific and can mainly be observed in two countries where local climate plans are compulsory, i.e. France and the UK. Finally, local climate plans produced for international climate networks (A3) are mostly found in the many countries where autonomous (type A1) plans are less common. This is the most comprehensive analysis of local climate planning to date. The findings are of international importance as they will inform and support decision-making towards climate planning and policy development at national, EU and global level being based on the most comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge of local climate planning available to date. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Cities; Climate change; Europe; Local climate plans; Mitigation; Paris agreement; SEAP/SECAP; Urban areas; Urban audit cities","Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Urban planning; Adaptation; Cities; Europe; Local climate; Mitigation; SEAP/SECAP; Urban areas; Urban audit cities; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046339015

Through an exploratory study of over 12,000 blog posts from five fashion bloggers, complemented by in-depth interviews, we trace the transformation of consumer bloggers. We identify and describe three identity phases, the individual consumer, collective blogger and blogger identity phase, and two important turning points. Our findings show that through a continuous process of identity negotiation, adaptation, and re-interpretation with multiple stakeholders, these bloggers transform into human brands. In turn, these individual transformation processes reciprocally influence the emergence of blogging as a professional practice and of the blogosphere as a new organizational field. These findings contribute to a theoretical understanding of consumer transformation processes in a new field, where consumers can leave their role as consumers through continuously engaging in identity negotiation, adaptation and re-interpretation, creating alternative points of reference and validation in a new field that in turn continues to influence their brand identity. Furthermore, our findings contribute to an understanding of human brands from a brand-as-process perspective, and have implications for brands wishing to collaborate with these influential actors. © 2018","Blogs; Consumer identity; Human brands; Self-presentation; Transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046105489

The company prides itself on being against the existing ‘elitist’ and commercialized Danish film industry. Inspired by the thesis that modern capitalism develops by incorporating the critiques directed against it, the article analyses how Zentropa’s Chief Executive Officer invests a ‘progressive’, counter-cultural spirit in his management practices. We describe how a ‘freethinking’ and ‘subversive’ CEO uses his dramatized performances to exercise an authority that violates employees’ privacy and involves public displays of disrespect. We further examine how employees use impression management to cope with norm-violating management practices, including sexual provocations and the dramatic, unjustified dismissal of an employee. In the context of these disruptions, we analyse how order is reestablished through dramaturgical cycles of symbolic events, including sacrifice. In particular, the study provides insights into how theatrically staged, norm-defying performances both disrupt the organization and allow managerial power to be reinstituted. It also demonstrates that anti-establishment management involves and rests upon the occasional exercise of traditional managerial hierarchy and control. Theoretically, the article develops a dramatist perspective, combining Goffman’s symbolic interactionism and Burke’s dramatism to offer a framework for understanding norm-transgressive management in modern organizations. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","creative industries; dramaturgy; Erving Goffman; film industry; Kenneth Burke; norm-transgression; sacrifice","article; employee; exercise; human; male; organization; penis; privacy; provocation; symbolic interactionism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042062612

Why, then, spend the costs? In this paper we address this puzzle and suggest why the extant empirical findings have so far proven limited. We consider the development of these practices and find that they have a substantially entangled and overlapping history, particularly at the RAND Corporation in the 1950s. Despite shared historical roots, the treatment of war gaming and scenario planning in the scholarly literature branched out into different streams. This separation is unfortunate because it obscures a better understanding of the premises under which these practices are effective. We propose an analysis of the overlaps and contrasts of war gaming and scenario planning that sets out clear boundary conditions for their use and efficacy. We find that each practice is tailored to provide strategic guidance in a context where the organization is facing different forms of uncertainty. This suggests they may be effective, and thus improve organizational performance, where the relevant uncertainties are operative. Such benefits would be apparent over longer time scales, and only if the relevant boundary conditions are met. However, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal empirical test of either war gaming or scenario planning is available. We therefore conclude that more research is needed to ascertain the true relationship between these popular practices and their performance outcomes. © 2017",,"Enterprise resource planning; Finance; Business contexts; Empirical findings; Empirical test; Organizational performance; Performance outcome; Rand corporations; Scenario Planning; Strategic guidance; Boundary conditions; boundary condition; literature review; organizational framework; performance assessment; planning method; scenario analysis; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039917723

The results show two kinds of make-or-buy decisions, called type 1 and type 2. In contrast to type 1 make-or-buy decisions whose scope is mostly limited to the production and quality function, type 2 decisions are strongly linked to engineering and R&D activities. Moreover, two new decision matrices are introduced: A 'product/subsystem aggregation' scheme and a 'make-or-buy controlling' matrix. In an environment in which companies move towards greater use of outsourcing, the framework ensures that company strategy and core competencies are followed in the long run despite short-range deviations of make-or-buy analysis results.

However, the challenges of transportation systems engineering necessitate breaking down the barriers between monodisciplinary models in order to understand holistically the consequences of technical and policy design decisions. In this chapter we review the need for multidisciplinary model-based systems engineering approaches in the transport sector and identify some emerging techniques enabling the linking of monodisciplinary semantically heterogeneous models. Simulations of such collaborative models (co-models) allow stakeholders to study system behaviour through the life cycle. Given the criticality of some transport applications, we also identify the need for advancing verification techniques in such multidisciplinary models. We illustrate our approach with an industry example in which the integration of diverse design models facilitates analysis of a new distributed rail interlocking system. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Design/methodology/approach: The author first identifies an important neglect in Professor Chen’s scholarship on competitive dynamics, i.e., the neglect of the ubiquity of the less visible competition between two actors who initially would not be considered as competitors. Then, the author proposes an asymmetry reversing theory (ART) of competitive dynamics to redress this neglect. The theory is presented in two parts. The first part describes the competitive dynamics between the two actors as a three-stage process of reversing the asymmetry in resource possession and market position between the resource-poor firm and its resource-rich rivals. The second part explains the key success factors for the resource-poor firm to go through each of the three stages. Findings: The growth process of the resource-poor firm can be broadly divided into three stages: surviving, catching-up, and outcompeting. For ambitious yet pragmatic resource-poor firms, in the surviving stage, they often (have to) accept the asymmetry between themselves and their resource-rich rivals in terms of resource possession and market position, and try to avoid any direct competition with the strong incumbents. They often tactically appear to pursue different paths of development from those of the strong incumbents by focusing on particular product categories and market segments. Doing so allows the resource-poor firms to win times and spaces for non-interrupted growth. Once they have accumulated sufficient resources and market experiences, they start to reduce the asymmetry between themselves and their better-endowed rivals by entering the similar or same product categories and market segments. To effectively catch up and outcompete the incumbents, they often differentiate themselves from their rivals by offering cheaper products or services, adding new features to their products, providing extra services to their customers, inventing new business models, etc. Research limitations/implications: One limitation of this paper is that the ART framework has so far been built on anecdotal evidences. It needs to be tested by empirical studies and refined further in the future. Another limitation is that the proposed theory is based on competitive dynamics between emerging market resource-poor firms and advanced country resource-rich firms. It needs to be tested whether this theory has applicability to any other firms. Originality/value: This paper fills an important research gap in the competitive dynamics literature by proposing an asymmetry reversing theory of competitive dynamics between a weak latecomer and a strong incumbent in a competitive field. © 2018, Xin Li.","Asymmetry; Competitive; Dynamics; Latecomer; Resource-poor; Reversing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043471201

Li’s assertion that Yin-Yang is superior to any other cognitive frames or logical systems for paradox research. The purpose of this paper is to alert the Chinese indigenous management researchers to the danger of Chinese exceptionalism and over-confidence. Design/methodology/approach: To show that Peter P. Li’s assertion is doubtful, the authors identify the flaws in his analysis. Findings: The authors find that there are three serious flaws in Peter P. Li’s analysis. First, there are four defects in the typology of cognitive frames he built in order to compare Yin-Yang with the others. Second, his understanding of dialectics in general and Hegelian dialectics in particular is flawed. And finally, without resorting to Yin-Yang, many scholars can develop theories that are equivalent to those derived from Yin-Yang. Research limitations/implications: Due to the page limit, this paper only focuses on arguing that Yin-Yang is not superior to other cognitive frames or logical systems without going one step further to explain in which situations Yin-Yang are valuable and might be more suitable than others for helping us understand some research issues. Practical implications: This paper implies that we should not blindly believe that the Chinese way of thinking and acting is superior to other people’s. Chinese people should be open-minded in the globalized era, not only promoting their own culture but also appreciating and learning from other cultures. Social implications: The reduction of cultural exceptionalism and ethnocentrism can make cross-cultural communication and interaction smoother. Originality/value: This paper is a rigorous critique on the “Yin-Yang being superior” assertion of Peter P.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors provide a novel and unobtrusive measure of CEO narcissism based on LinkedIn profiling. The authors investigate the relationship between CEO narcissism and corporate risk taking (stock return volatility) for a sample of 475 US manufacturing firms in the period 2010-2014. Findings: The authors find an inverse U-shape relationship between CEO narcissism and stock return volatility. The inverse U-shape relationship (the “humpback”) is caused by the paradoxical nature of the narcissistic personality in which the self-esteem is high but at the same time fragile with a combination of self-admiration and a constant need of having this positive self-view confirmed. The results are robust to alternative specifications of CEO narcissism and corporate risk taking. The results are economically meaningful. Thus, a moderate degree of CEO narcissism – as compared to a very low or a very high level of CEO narcissism – is associated with an increase in corporate risk taking of approximately 12 percent. Originality/value: Previous literature provides multiple analyses on the association between managerial overconfidence and corporate decisions. As opposed to overconfidence, narcissism is a personality trait having both cognitive and behavioral dimensions. This paper provides a novel contribution to the growing literature on the association between managerial biases/traits and corporate decision-making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Behavioural corporate finance; CEO narcissism; Corporate risk taking; LinkedIn profiles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049646406

Such an investigation has to involve some in-depth conceptualisation with respect to the meanings of both marketing and violence. The market is an institution related to other institutions which altogether are–as in all societies–trying to cope with violence. Today our societies are based on both markets and democracy, but those institutions tend to be mutually contradictory. When marketing tends to replace politics and to almost religiously convert citizens into consumers it is social cohesion that is at stake. This paper aims at contributing to a deeper understanding of social/historical trends. As it highlights the importance of ideas (representations and motivations) and their links with changing institutions, it might help researchers and marketers to a broader understanding of their role and towards a more conscious social behaviour. © 2018, © 2018 Westburn Publishers Ltd.","market; marketing; normalisation; Social change; social cohesion; violence",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055927174

However, PSS are not necessarily environmentally benign compared to conventional systems. Quantitative environmental performance evaluations of PSS are hence needed. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a commonly used method for environmental performance evaluation. However, applying LCA in the context of PSS requires specific considerations, which are not sufficiently addressed by current LCA guidelines. In this article, we propose a set of guidelines consisting of six steps, which elaborates the LCA process with respect to the specific consideration for PSS assessment. The guidelines were developed based on identified challenges for the application of LCA on PSS, a review of existing LCAs on PSS case studies, expert consultations, case study applications, and structured user feedback. The use of the guidelines is demonstrated on three exemplifying cases, covering three different scopes for PSS evaluation. By applying the guidelines, the risk of biased results, predictable rebound effects and significant cut-of errors should be reduced. Future work includes evaluating the guidelines through full-scale case applications and further development of dynamic and prospective modelling approaches for assessing systemic consequences and rebound effects. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Environmental evaluation; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Product/service-systems; Rebound effects","Environmental impact; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Environmental evaluation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Product/service-systems; Rebound effect; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047641311

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate enablers of reconfigurability in terms of their importance in industry, current level of implementation in industry, and significant differences in their implementation and criticality across different manufacturing settings. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire survey is conducted, in order to provide generalizable empirical evidence across various industries and manufacturing types. Findings: The findings indicate that the level of implementation of the reconfigurability enablers is rudimentary, while their criticality is perceived higher than the current level of implementation. Moreover, significant differences regarding implementation and criticality of mobility, scalability, and convertibility were found for companies with varying degrees of manual work, make-to-stock production, and varying production volume, industry type and organization size. Research limitations/implications: Main limitations of the research cover the relatively small sample size and non-random sampling method applied, primarily limited to one country, which could be increased to further extent the findings reported in this paper. Practical implications: The findings indicate that the importance and implementation of reconfigurability enablers is contingent on the manufacturing setting. Thus, the research presented in this paper provides valuable knowledge in regard to aiding a paradigm shift in industry and help companies design manufacturing systems with the right reconfigurability enablers.

In the present study, we combined a Process Flowsheet Simulation (PFS) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a small scale decentralized GBR to screen environmental impact profiles for potential biomass feedstocks for GBR conversion. Furthermore, we carried out hotspot and sensitivity analysis to identify where the largest impacts arise in the biorefining stage in order to provide recommendations and focus points for GBR technology developers. The GBR considered in this study produces a protein-rich feed for monogastric animals and an energy-rich feed from the press pulp and biogas from the GBR residues. The included biomass feedstocks are: alfalfa, grass-clover, festulolium and ryegrass. These biomasses were selected to accommodate variations in central biomass characteristics like: crop yields, rate of fertilizer application, chemical biomass compositions and related potential environmental implications. Among the studied crops, alfalfa provides the best overall environmental performance due to its high yield and low agricultural input demands. Results of the hotspot analysis further identified the coagulation and the drying as the processes that induce most of the environmental impacts in the biorefining stage. Conversion of green biomass for the production of feed and energy could provide environmental benefits compared to the production of conventional feed. However, the GBR technology have still room for optimization in order to further reduce the environmental impacts, across all impact categories, by decreasing energy consumption and increasing conversion efficiency. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biobased products; Biorefineries; Green biomass; Life cycle assessment; Process flowsheet simulation","Bioconversion; Biomass; Crops; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Feedstocks; Flowcharting; Life cycle; Refining; Sensitivity analysis; Bio-based products; Biorefineries; Environmental benefits; Environmental implications; Environmental performance; Fertilizer applications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Process flow-sheet; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048201143

Today's bridge constructions highly rely on the non-renewable resources, the consumption of fossil fuels, and the intensive usage of concrete. This urges designers to explore the new design options to mitigate the associated environmental burdens. When comparing to the concrete slab frame bridges (CFB), the soil-steel flexible culverts (or soil-steel composite bridge, SSCB) show advantages in ease erection, low maintenance as well as the competitive cost. However, its environmental performance has never been studied. This paper intends to compare the environmental performance of these two bridge types through the whole life cycle, based on 8 selected cases in Sweden.

The construction phase, which seldom included previously, is a specific focus in this paper. The results find that: 1) the SSCBs show advantages over the CFBs in most of the investigated indicators; 2) the construction phase, when explicitly evaluated, may take up to 34% of the total life cycle environmental burdens; 3) the environmental performance of a bridge is closely linked with the bridge type selection, multiple indicators in the environmental domain, designers’ preference, the construction phase, as well as the time schedule constraints. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bridge LCA; CO2 emission; Global warming; Life cycle assessment; Soil-steel composite bridge; Steel flexible culvert; Sustainable construction","Composite bridges; Concrete slabs; Culverts; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Soils; Steel bridges; Sustainable development; CO2 emissions; Cumulative energy demands; Environmental burdens; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Non-renewable resource; Steel composite bridges; Sustainable construction; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047923889

This book provides a much-needed introduction to the potential applications of theories of practice in tourism studies. It brings together a variety of approaches exploring how theories of practice bridge themes and fields which are usually addressed separately within tourism research: consumption and production; travel and the everyday; governance and policy; technology and the social. The book critically engages with practices as a fruitful approach to tourism research as well as how the particularities of tourism might inform our understanding of practice theories. This book contributes to conceptual and methodological debates providing insights from authors who have engaged with practice theory as an entry point to researching tourism. It offers a solid starting point for researchers and students alike who wish to learn about, and try, this approach, as well as explore its possibilities and limitations in the field of tourism. © 2019 Laura James, Carina Ren and Henrik Halkier.

Food marketing might offer products and services that help consumers to reduce their food waste or reduce the consumer-related food waste at the consumer–retailer interface. However, such strategies require consumer acceptance and targeting the right customers. Through an online survey of 800 Danish consumers and a measure of food-related lifestyle, four clusters of consumer segments are identified. The segments are compared with regard to their acceptance of a number of actions consumers can take to reduce food waste or their acceptance of food marketing services they would need to pay for. Acceptance differs with food involvement and the role of the price criterion, as well as with gender, education and age. The findings show how food marketing can help consumers to reduce food waste, through actions targeted to specific segments of consumers characterized by food-related lifestyle differences. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.","consumer behavior; Food waste; food-related lifestyle; policy acceptance; segmentation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049096733

The paper contribute to the literature on hedonic pricing by applying this model to the Chinese market and including COO as product attribute. Design/methodology/approach: A hedonic price model is adopted to measure the effect of search attributes on wine sales in China. A reduced form of the classical hedonic analysis is used as in Nerlove (1995), given the assumption that prices and attributes are taken as exogenous to consumers. Findings: Results show that the COO represents the attribute that most influences wine sales in China. Protected indicators of origin, which denote wine with recognised certificates, are also significant, reinforcing the importance of the production area. Vintage attribute does not impact sales, suggesting a low level of consumer experience with wine. Research limitations/implications: The study suffers from the limitations of results’ generalisability, given the size and characteristics of the sample. In the future research, the model should be tested on a larger sample. Moreover, it can be applied on other products, in which COO represents an information and quality cue. Practical implications: Firms operating in sectors where COO implies specific characteristics of quality should enhance this attribute in their marketing strategies to increase their competitive advantage. Also policy implications with respect to the governmental actions to support wine producers are discussed. Originality/value: Hedonic price analysis represents a well-established model; however, to the best of the authors’ knowledge it has never been used in China before. This study also highlights the primary role of COO as search attribute in wine purchase. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Consumer; Country of origin; Hedonic price; New world wine; Wine","article; China; consumer; human; marketing; wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048545290

It is difficult to meet the requirements by system optimisation in the final design phase, so recent research has focused on ways of meeting the target by adapting the whole design process and informing the industry of them. This has led to optimised design processes such as Integrated Energy Design, in which many decisions related to energy consumption and indoor climate are made in the early design stages. The current tendency is to use an expanded notion of sustainability, derived from the sustainability certification system itself, and to apply it even in the early design process. This perspective emphasises all phases of the life cycle of a building. The goal of the present study was to map how a Danish architectural office approached sustainability in the projects they undertook in the course of a year. All the projects concerned were intended to conform to the German Sustainability Certification System DGNB. We developed a mapping tool to document these case projects and found that different sets of certification criteria were used in each project. This demonstrates the complexity of using them as design parameters in practice, but also that it was successfully achieved. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","case study; DGNB; Integrated energy design; mapping; sustainability","Energy utilization; Life cycle; Mapping; Sustainable development; Certification systems; Design parameters; Design projects; DGNB; Early design stages; Energy design; Recent researches; System optimisation; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033363653

Through an explorative study of digital entrepreneurs we examine how entrepreneurs identify business opportunities and how they translate them into a workable business idea. Although entrepreneurs typically have difficulty explaining their business model components we identified that critical features in our simplicity framework include three main modules, transaction/matching, marketing and back-office components, and simplicity in terms of value proposition, conceptualization approach and usability.

One stream of research has proposed that culture is a set of relatively stable collective values that are transmitted to the individual in a straightforward and linear manner. In this functionalist perspective, culture is perceived to be a fixed entity firmly delimited by the nation state. Hence, the cross-national distance between comparable values has been a central scholarly focus in this tradition. An alternative and less pervasive line of research has adopted a constructivist approach. Here culture is considered a complex, dynamic interpersonal process. These two perspectives have developed relatively independently and offer scholars and students of IM different analytical insights. In this article we account for key characteristics of the two approaches and offer an alternative, integrative perspective that takes into account some central insights of both research trends, namely practice theory. In doing so, we avoid some of the inherent analytical pitfalls associated with the more radical functionalist and constructivist perspectives. © 2018, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bourdieu; constructivist; culture; functionalist; international business; international management; practice theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051955682

We ask whether public employees’ preferences for flexible rule application go hand in hand with acceptance of bending the rules, even if it means a breach of impartiality. We find that this is the case. We also find that contrary to what the New Public Governance approach expects, neither citizen participation nor generalized trust works as a control on rule bending.

Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth multiple-case study of five departments across four hospitals facing fast to slow response task requirements was carried out using interviews and observations. The selected cases were revealing as the departments had designed and formalized their daily hospital operations differently to solve collaboration and performance issues. Findings: Local collaboration across occupational and departmental boundaries requires bundles of behavioral formalization elements (e.g. standardized plans, resource allocation decisions, assigned formal roles, and handoff routines), and liaison devices (e.g. huddles, boards, and physical proximity), which are used in parallel or sequence. The authors label this “designed collaboration bundles.” These bundles supplement the central organizational structures, processes, and support systems less capable of ensuring fluent coordination at the front line. Practical implications: Health care professionals and hospital managers can consider designing bundles of organizational design features to proactively develop and ensure collaboration capable of solving collective tasks and bridging departmental and occupational silos to improve health care delivery.

This paper demonstrates that the theory of constraints (TOC)-based measures, Throughput and Inventory Dollar-Days (T/IDD), induce autonomous supply chain (SC) links to function as a synergistic whole and thereby, improve the performance of the whole SC network significantly. We model an SC network of a well-known TOC case study using discrete event simulation and discuss managerial implications of these measures via a set of scenarios. The scenarios explain how these measures–without sharing sensitive financial data–allow members of an SC network to monitor both the effectiveness (TDD) and efficiency (IDD) of SC members and lead them to create win-win solutions following well-known TOC-based planning and control concepts.

In this regard, continuous monitoring of patients and their relatives, collecting real world data and preventive education are important issues that impose high costs and implementation-related problems. Within the recent years, the advent of new technological advancements, including feature-rich smartphones, location-based technologies, Internet of Things and wearables as well as new computing concepts, e.g. crowd computing, put forward new opportunities. However, a remarkable number of efforts still rely on traditional, and relatively less-efficient, approaches. In order to fill this gap in the context of metabolic disease research and performing the aforementioned tasks in the form of an integrated system, in this paper a system for Metabolic Syndrome Control and caring (MetaSyCar) is introduced. The major benefit of the proposed system is to provide a comprehensive and multifaceted monitoring framework in order to track the patients' behaviors, conditions and health indices. Moreover, the system interactivity facilitates the experts' interventions and supervisory considerations.

To enhance the detection performance of a single IDS, collaborative intrusion detection systems or networks (CIDSs or CIDNs) are often implemented in practical organizations, which encourage a set of IDS nodes to exchange information like alarms and signatures with each other. However, due to the distributed nature, malicious nodes within such collaborative network are able to generate untruthful signatures and share to others. This may significantly degrade the effectiveness and efficiency of detection. Recently, blockchain technology has received much attention from both academia and industry, which can provide a verifiable manner for distributed architectures without the need of a trusted intermediary. In this work, our motivation is thus to develop CBSigIDS, a generic framework of collaborative blockchained signature-based IDSs, which utilizes blockchains to help incrementally update a trusted signature database for different IDS nodes in a collaborative network. In the evaluation, our results show that blockchain technology can indeed help enhance the robustness and effectiveness of signature-based IDSs under adversarial scenarios via building a trusted signature database. © 2018 IEEE.","Blockchain Technology; Collaborative and Distributed Network; Generic Framework; Insider Attacks; Intrusion Detection Systems; Signature-based Approach","Blockchain; Computer crime; Green computing; Internet of things; Network security; Distributed networks; Generic frameworks; Insider attack; Intrusion Detection Systems; Signature-based approach; Intrusion detection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062294162

Although the technology is very old, it gained a huge traction in the past two decades. 3D printing favors unique once-off orders (mass customization) in contrast to mass production. This calls for innovative business models in order to realize economic gains from the technology. Increased product innovations in the global economy also contribute to wide adoption of 3D printing unlike in the old days. A transition in the manufacturing field has brought e-manufacturing and now cloud-based manufacturing. Machines, including 3D printers, in the past were not Internetenabled but modern designs have the capability of Internet connectivity. Cloud-based 3D printing is a new model of design that has a significant impact on today's entrepreneurs. This article focuses on a business case for a cloud-based approach in consumer product niches. A cloud-based 3D printing business model (3D-Cloud) is developed based on the business model canvas, which promises major breakthroughs in e-entrepreneurship innovation.

More specifically, we hypothesise that inspirational motivation from a team leader can compensate for a lack of inclusive group attitudes in the form of team openness to language diversity. We also predict the positive effects of “inspirational motivation” leadership to be stronger than those of the “management by exception” style of leadership.

Our starting point is that among firm hires, individuals with university research experience—hired from universities or firms—can be particularly valuable. However, conflicting institutional logics between academia and industry makes working with academic scientists challenging at times for firms. We suggest two solutions to this difficulty: hiring “ambidextrous” individuals with a mix of experience of university research and working for a technologically advanced firm, and a strong organizational research culture in the recruiting firm reflected by the presence of a scientist on the top management team. We track the mobility of R&D workers empirically using patent and linked employer-employee data. Managerial Summary: An important way to make organizations more innovative is hiring individual researchers with the right types of skills and experience. We show that individuals with university research experience beyond their final degree are particularly likely to help boost firm-level innovation output after hiring compared to R&D workers with other types of skills and experience. However, to obtain good returns to innovation from hiring such individuals, firms need a university research–friendly organizational culture when hiring individuals with university research experience, from either firms or academia.

Based on an analysis of five years of panel data for 886 listed firms and their 6.2 million relevant microblogs, we observed three interesting results. First, the valence of social media UGC has a U-shaped relationship with firms’ innovation investments; and compared with neutral UGC, both negative and positive content lead to more innovation investment. Second, we found that this curvilinear relationship is mitigated as the volume of UGC increases. Third, we verified that increasing innovation investment improves firm performance.

China has a great deal of coal, less oil, and little gas, so the Chinese government is enthusiastically developing the coal-based chemical industry, of which coal-based methanol production is an important part. Coal-based methanol production strongly affects the environment, so the environmental impacts of coal-based methanol production processes must be assessed. Here, two life-cycle assessment models are established using GaBi6 software, and the models and local data for coal-based methanol production are used to establish a life-cycle inventory. The environmental impacts of two typical coal-based methanol production techniques are evaluated using the CML 2001 (mid-point level) method and the Eco-indicator 99 (end-point level) models. The results indicated that less environment harm is caused by producing methanol using the coal coking technology than by producing methanol using the coal gasification technology, especially in terms of acidification, global warming, and photochemical oxidation. In particular, significantly less environmental harm in terms of climate change and radiation is caused by the coal coking technology than by the coal gasification technology. Different sub-processes clearly make different contributions to environmental harm. The results indicated that the methanol production process, heating, and desalination are the main sources of environmental harm for both the coal gasification technology and coal coking technology. Importantly, the public engineering process rather than the methanol production process itself was found to determine emissions for the different methanol production methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; Coal coking technology (CCT); Coal gasification technology (CGT); Coal-based methanol production; Life-cycle assessment (LCA)","Binary alloys; Bismuth alloys; Chemical industry; Coal; Coal gasification; Coal industry; Coking; Desalination; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gallium alloys; Global warming; Methanol; China; Coking technologies; Gasification technologies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methanol production; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047453786

We examine the electric bicycle (e-bike) sector in China to understand the future prospects for urban mobility and the interaction of e-bikes as a form of vernacular technology within the existing transport regime. For this purpose, we address the following questions: 1) What factors will influence the future adoption of e-bikes? 2) How are alternative travel modes evaluated against e-bikes? 3) Will e-bikes become a popular sustainable mobility mode in the future or only an intermediary mode to cars? To provide answers, we conducted a survey in Nanjing city in order to assess the attitude of e-bike users, and other mode users (e.g. pedestrians; bicycle users). We then analyse responses from this survey through the lens of sociotechnical transitions theory, notably the “Multi-Level Perspective” notions of niches, regimes, and landscape. The paper explores the influential factors underpinning future e-bike adoption and the decision-making calculus behind alternative mode choices.

Commentators have pointed to the ‘ordoliberalization’ of EU economic policy with Germany at its core, albeit with the latter taking the role of a ‘reluctant hegemon’. Perhaps as a result of this pervasive influence, some have claimed that the EU is itself ordoliberal, resting on a particular understanding of the relationship between ordoliberalism and an ‘economic constitution’. For this claim to be substantiated, the characterization of ordoliberalism needs to persist across time and the EU's law and policy-making spaces.

We tested this hypothesis in three decision-making studies, manipulating the location of a product label in an unpredictable, a predictable, and a mixed visual environment. In Study 1 and Study 2, we find that participants are less likely to fixate a low and medium relevance label in a predictable location, and in Study 3, we find that participants are more likely to fixate a high relevance label in a predictable location. Our findings suggest that predictable locations increase while unpredictable locations decrease top-down control.

In Danish central government, this balance is stressed by norms that define the correct behavior when the civil service provides ministers with political advice and assistance. Organizational factors strongly influence civil servants' behavior when they have to balance responsiveness against constraints on their role as political advisers. Moreover, civil servants working closely with ministers pay more attention to legal constraints than their peers among agency officials and specialists.

While the impact of Peter Hall's approach to policy paradigms on the study of governance has been immense, there is a burgeoning consensus that a “Kuhnian” understanding of paradigms makes punctuated equilibrium style shifts the only game in town. While Hall's approach can account for inter-paradigm change with reference to exogenous shocks, it does not allow for significant ideational shifts to occur intra-paradigm. To remedy this, we place ideational power dynamics at the heart of the study of policy paradigms. We demonstrate the general applicability of our approach by examining the evolution of British macroeconomic policy-making since 1990. We show how key policy-makers were able to employ their institutional and ideational power to reinterpret and redefine the dominant neoliberal understanding of the economy to match their own specific ideas and policy priorities. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021411174

They must have a sharp economical focus while simultaneously engaging in creative and innovative thinking. They must support individuals as well as teams, think globally, and do business locally. This book views complexity as a fundamental element of leadership, rather than something that should simply be reduced and removed. It presents a leadership concept that includes both sides of the paradox. Managing Leadership Paradoxes uses case studies and practical exercises to show how managers can maintain decisiveness in the face of paradoxes, complexities, and contradictory demands. Lotte Lüscher draws on research gleaned from managers within the international corporation, Lego, to provide first- hand knowledge of how a large- scale organization meets and manages change paradoxes, rather than treating them as something that needs to be reduced and removed. It will assist managers and aspiring managers in expanding their understanding of leadership challenges beyond dilemmas, and equip them with the managerial skills to handle the most persistent and pervasive paradoxical challenges that arise as a result of organizational change. The book will be of interest to leaders and managers, as well as students of leadership, management, and organizational studies. The intent is to provide the reader with a foundation for reflecting on his or her own leadership practice with special focus on organizational complexity, ambiguity, and paradoxes. © 2019 Lotte S.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on ethnographic fieldwork in a multinational biopharmaceutical corporation, and drawing on anthropological theory of social identities, the paper demonstrates the multiple and fluid identities that we as organizational ethnographers purposefully take on, accidentally acquire, unintentionally are ascribed with and experience during ethnographic fieldwork in familiar settings. Findings: Building on these insights, and by expanding the literature on researcher identities, the paper develops a critique of the spatial and temporal notions often attached to fieldwork in familiar settings by demonstrating how outsider identities are ascribed even “at home” and how insider identities can be experienced when away. It further reflects on the ways in which these identities shape the data generation and interpretation process. Originality/value: This paper argues that to properly grasp the multiple identity processes involved in a fieldwork, we must escape the spatial and temporal conceptualization of being either an insider or an outsider. Instead, the paper argues for a relational and situational perspective on being an insider and an outsider in the field and proposes to conceptualize “insider” and “outsider” as ascribed, changing and sometimes volatile social identities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ethnography; Fieldwork; Identity; Positioning; Qualitative techniques",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047139803

Financial services companies are trying to become more customer focused, but struggling to help huge customer segments, particularly in developing economies. Alternative financial models and tools are emerging, which are being embraced by consumers and incumbents. In large parts of the developing world, alternative services are leapfrogging traditional finance, meaning more and more people have access to finance without ever needing a bank. Meanwhile, the barriers around financial services companies are crumbling, as they become more reliant on integration with new providers and alternative types of service. Financial products can no longer be viewed in isolation, but as part of a service landscape that supports how people do life. This means rethinking how our businesses are designed, motivated and organised, and letting go of the old ways of thinking about supply and demand.

Design/methodology/approach: Combining theories within opinion leadership, celebrity endorsement, product placement and user-generated content (UGC) five source characteristics – namely, expertise, trustworthiness, likeability, similarity and familiarity – are investigated using fashion as an example. A longitudinal netnographic study of ten CIs and their UGC and six focus groups with followers of specific CIs on Instagram are conducted. Findings: All five characteristics contribute to the persuasiveness of CIs with trustworthiness as the main contributor. CIs persuasiveness lies in their unique ability to encompass two opposing qualities simultaneously: being attainable and relatable like ordinary consumers; being taste leaders with superior, celebrity-like status. Research limitations/implications: Only qualitative studies within the fashion category have been conducted, wherefore the relative weight between the two qualities cannot be quantified. Practical implications: When choosing a CI, managers may consider: the amount of followers per CI as an indicator of influence; similarity between follower and CI as it provides the basis for trust; and the CIs personal universe on their Instagram profile as it leverage the meanings associated with the brand. Originality/value: The key driver of CIs persuasiveness is their trustworthiness which mediates and amplifies the effect of the other four characteristics. CIs’ persuasive power rests upon the balancing act of being relatable and aspirational. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Citizen influencers; Instagram; Opinion leaders; Persuasion; Source attractiveness; Source credibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047143071

In this process, influential factors such as drivers and barriers have to be examined, and stakeholders’ different perspectives on RL implementation and development should also be considered. This paper presents a multi-perspective framework for reverse logistics implementation using the lens of stakeholder theory. The multiple stakeholders’ perspective framework was developed based upon a structured literature review process. Fifty-four papers concerning these topical areas were thoroughly assessed and classified according to their structural dimensions and analytical categories. Two extensive lists of 37 drivers and 36 barriers, categorized and analyzed against the dimensions and categories, served as a basis for the development of the referred framework. Thereby, the overall contribution of this work proposes an understanding of the factors required for employing reverse logistics from multiple perspectives, including those of the company, society, government, and customer. Additionally, each perspective is discussed separately with the aid of previous works developed in the field. Most of the encountered barriers are placed in the firm's perspective; however, these barriers may be an effect from outside impediments. On the drivers’ side, the factors must be acknowledged so managers can prepare for changes by exploring these positive influential factors. A consideration of the influential factors from multiple perspectives is critical for creating a comprehensive industry strategy to successfully implement product return. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Drivers; Reverse logistics; Systematic literature review","Environmental regulations; Truck drivers; Barriers; Environmental operations; Industry strategies; Multi-perspective frameworks; Multiple stakeholders; Reverse logistics; Structural dimensions; Systematic literature review; Logistics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044599139

For example, along with the rapid economic development, China has been experiencing a sharp increase in the production and use of TV sets and a quick transition from old fashion cathode ray tube (CRT) ones to flat panel display (FPT) ones. Understanding such dynamics would be important for predicting future WEEE generation. In this article, we developed a dynamic (from 1992 to 2040), bottom-up (TV sets by module by material), and stock-driven (using future possession as a driver) material flow analysis model to investigate the amount of metals and plastics embodied in obsolete TV sets in the future. We found that the total generation of obsolete TV sets in China will reach 142 million units by 2040, in which FPD TV sets contribute more after they started to dominate the market after 2009. These growing obsolete TV sets would mean potentially large amount of embodied materials that can be recycled. While most of the embodied precious metals (e.g., gold, silver, and palladium), common metals (e.g., iron, aluminum, zinc, and tin), toxic metals (e.g., mercury, barium, and antimony), and plastics will increase in future, copper and nickel show a first decrease then increase trend, and lead will be gradually phased out in obsolete TV sets. Our results could help inform waste management and recycling strategies and relevant decision makers (e.g., governmental agencies, manufactures, and recyclers) in the TV sets sector in China. Such a stock-driven and bottom-up approach can also be used for other e-waste issues and other countries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Obsolete TV sets; Stock in use; Substance flow analysis; Waste management; WEEE recycling","Cathode ray tubes; Cathodes; Decision making; Developing countries; Elastomers; Environmental impact; Flat panel displays; Metal analysis; Metals; Oscillators (electronic); Plastic recycling; Plastics; Waste management; Economic development; Governmental agency; Material flow analysis; Stock in use; Substance flow analysis; TV sets; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Weee recycling; Electronic Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044591749

Ecosystem service approach is an emerging paradigm to address natural resource degradation and achieve sustainability in agribusiness organizations. A case study method is used to identify environmental issues at one of the premium wine organizations based in South Australia. This study conducts semi-structured interviews with multiple informants to analyze how this organization integrates ecosystem services approach in their management systems. These semi-structured interviews with multiple informants identified three categories of environmental issues: (1) primary (water use efficiency, soil health, carbon emissions), (2) secondary (energy, water availability), and (3) tertiary (waste water recycling, salinity in soil, loss of biodiversity, impacts due to climate change projections, winery waste management, soil carbon). We used Ecosystem Based Business Risk Analysis Tool (EBBRAT) and found freshwater availability as a major risk for this organization. This tool led to the identification of key areas, such as biological control of insect pests, maintaining biodiversity and management of soil, as an opportunity for the wine company to enhance sustainability. This study highlights ecosystem service approach to achieve sustainability in wine and other agribusiness organizations. This case study is followed by two interactive exercises to illustrate the application of the ideas discussed in the chapter. The chapter concludes with lessons learnt to develop sustainable food systems and some questions that reflect the ideas presented in the chapter and are aimed at shifting the focus toward food sustainability. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

The goal is to nuance the current polarized debate of consistency or no consistency. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative research strategy is employed in this paper. Specifically, the empirical work rests on an interview study with strategists from ten different CVI agencies. The interview transcripts are analyzed using template analysis. Findings: In terms of findings, both empirical and conceptual arguments for and against CVI consistency are presented. Many of these arguments rest on conflicting assumptions of CVI communication, CVI authenticity and CVI management, which all influence the debate of CVI consistency. Practical implications: CVI practitioners are presented with a more reflective approach to dealing with consistency and hands on examples for inspiration. Originality/value: This paper offers alternative and more nuanced conceptualizations of CVI consistency. This includes seeing consistency and inconsistency as ends of a spectrum to be balanced rather than mutually exclusive and by differentiating between consistency across platforms and consistency over time – coined CVI continuity. Furthermore, several future research areas that can help to further develop the field of CVI are suggested. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agencies; Consistency; Corporate visual identity; Corporate visual identity management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047237344

Drawing on the Racial Classification Model (RCM) for a theoretical model, this article examines how client ethnicity shapes public employees' decisions to sanction clients. Using Danish employment agencies as our empirical setting, we present findings from two complementary studies. Study 1 uses nationwide administrative data. Examining sanctioning activity at the employment agency-level, we find that agencies with a larger percentage of clients being non-Western immigrants or their descendants impose a greater overall number of sanctions and dispense them with greater frequency. Study 2 uses survey experimental data to build on this finding. Addressing concerns about internal validity and a need for analyses at the individual employee-level, we present survey experimental evidence that employment agency caseworkers are more likely to recommend sanctions for ethnic minority (Middle-Eastern origin) clients than for ethnic majority (Danish origin) clients. Moreover, we investigate how three caseworker characteristics-ethnicity, gender, and work experience-condition the relationship between client ethnicity and caseworkers' decisions to sanction clients. Although we find no moderation effects for ethnicity or gender, work experience appears to diminish the influence of client ethnicity on the caseworkers' sanctioning decisions. Overall, our studies support the likelihood that ethnic minority clients will be punished more often for policy infractions than ethnic majority clients-and that caseworker work experience mitigates part of this bias. © The Author(s) 2018.

Although there is an emergent literature on performance information use, we still know little on how managers engage in functional performance management practices. At the same time, growing evidence suggests that managers face pressure to improve low performance because of a negativity bias in the political environment. However, in managerial performance information use, the negativity bias might be reconsidered as a prioritization heuristic with positive performance attributes, directing attention to organizational goals with a favorable return of investment. I test this argument with data from public schools. A fixed-effect estimation is used to analyze how principals prioritize when they are provided with performance information on a number of different educational goals. Furthermore, a difference-in-differences model tests whether the prioritizations of certain goals have performance-enhancing effects over time. The analysis shows that principals prioritize goals with low performance and that prioritizations result in performance increase. The improvements primarily occur for goals that have a low performance level and that are repeatedly prioritized. © The Author(s) 2018.

The Icelandic banks are compared with three Danish banks to separate crisis-driven responses from simple market-driven reactions. Design/methodology/approach: Empirical data were collected using semi-structured interviews. The participating Icelandic and Danish banks were considered as two units, which formed the basis for a comparative case study between the two countries. Findings: Driven by an understanding of what is expected by the market rather than the need to inform and guide the employees the Icelandic banks implemented a number of revolutionary and formally documented changes. These changes included significant bigger risk management functions and policies and procedures documenting “everything”. However, in both countries, it seems that new values supported by the “tone at the top”, areas with limited formal documentation, are the most important management tools. Research limitations/implications: The study relies on interviews with employees, and the actual changes of administrative controls have not been reviewed. The most important implication is that the situated logics in Iceland driven by external institutional pressure initiated a revolutionary implementation of values bypassing existing routines and formalised rules.

Configuration projects implement configurators as information technology systems that help companies manage the specification process of customised products. An effective method of retrieving and formalising knowledge for configurators is essential, because it can reduce the risk of unsuccessful implementation and the time and effort required for development. Unfortunately, no standard KM frameworks are available specifically for configuration projects. This study identifies the knowledge necessary for different phases of a configuration project (which knowledge, for what purpose and from what sources), examines how it is transformed during a configuration project (what KM activities and tools are used) and establishes how the knowledge can be documented for future maintenance and updates. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a four-step framework for making the KM process more efficient in configuration projects. The framework is based on the literature, developed in collaboration with industrial partners and tested on four configuration projects in two engineering companies. The framework is a structured KM approach designed to save time for both domain experts and the configuration team. The authors have used a qualitative exploratory design based on multiple data sources: documentation, workshops and participant observation. Findings: The proposed framework comprises four steps: determination of the system’s scope, to establish the project’s goal based on stakeholders’ requirements and prioritise the required products and processes; knowledge acquisition, to classify the knowledge according to the desired output and identify different knowledge sources; modelling and knowledge validation; and documentation and maintenance, to ensure that the KM system can be maintained and updated in the future. Research limitations/implications: Because the framework is tested on a limited number of cases, its generalisability may be limited. However, focusing on a few case applications allows us to assess the effectiveness of the framework in detail and in depth to identify the practical challenges of applying it. The results of the tests support the framework’s validity. Although the framework is designed mainly for engineering companies, other industries could benefit from using it as well. Practical implications: The individual steps of the framework create a structured approach for the KM process. Thus, the approach can save both time and resources for companies, without the need for additional investment. Originality/value: A standard framework is lacking in the literature on KM for configuration projects. This study fills that gap by developing a KM framework for configuration projects, based on KM frameworks developed for IT projects, and KM tools. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Configuration projects; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge management; Product documentation; Product modelling; Scoping",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043467583

Instead of another attempt to grasp its essence, this book offers a critical reflection that problematizes the use of energy security itself. After a short historical and methodological analysis of the proliferation of energy security, The Politics of Energy Security unpacks three social practices that drive energy security. These include an analysis of the logics of security, a study of the relation between the materiality of sociotechnical (energy) systems and the knowledge people have over such systems, and a reflection on the power and politics behind (energy) security. Each of these are discussed and ultimately illustrated in the last chapter to show how energy security works, how it is shaped and what role it plays within political processes. Based on a novel performative reading of energy security with its focus on ontological politics and an in-depth look at the often implicitly accepted social practices that determine how people shape and are shaped by energy security, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of energy security and policy, political theory, international relations, critical security studies, and environmental studies more broadly. © 2018 Johannes Kester.

However, the aspect of value associated with big data in SCM is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to mitigate the weakly understood nature of big data concerning big data’s value in SCM from a business process perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A content-analysis-based literature review has been completed, in which an inductive and three-level coding procedure has been applied on 72 articles. Findings: By identifying and defining constructs, a big data SCM framework is offered using business process theory and value theory as lenses. Value discovery, value creation and value capture represent different value dimensions and bring a multifaceted view on how to understand and realize the value of big data. Research limitations/implications: This study further elucidates big data and SCM literature by adding additional insights to how the value of big data in SCM can be conceptualized. As a limitation, the constructs and assimilated measures need further empirical evidence. Practical implications: Practitioners could adopt the findings for conceptualization of strategies and educational purposes. Furthermore, the findings give guidance on how to discover, create and capture the value of big data. Originality/value: Extant SCM theory has provided various views to big data.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on multiple case studies to challenge traditional notions of SE. Six SEs operating at the BoP in Kenya are analysed. Interviews are conducted with entrepreneurs from each enterprise, during which the enterprises’ business models are mapped and scrutinised. Findings: Based on the six case studies, the paper argues that the SE concept is challenged in a BoP context: the six Kenyan SEs viewed social and commercial orientation as equally important and mutually supportive; viewed social orientation as a competitive advantage; and did not consider social objectives as harmonious. These findings corroborate key claims of the BoP literature, e.g. that it is not possible meaningfully to distinguish social and commercial missions at the BoP as they are intertwined; that any company succeeding at the BoP will have a social impact; and that the pursuit of some social objectives may undermine the achievement of other social objectives. The overall conclusion of the paper is that in BoP environments, the concept of SE becomes illusive. Originality/value: This paper adds perspective to existing literature on SE at the BoP and provides empirical evidence that can help shape the understanding of social business activities in East Africa. The paper demonstrates that in BoP environments, the boundaries between social and commercial enterprise become illusive. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Base of the pyramid; Business model canvas; Case studies; Kenya; Social enterprise",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049602630

More sales volume means an increase in profits, market power, and market shares. This investigation analyzes optimal pricing and replenishment decisions of a single-manufacturer/multiple-retailer supply chain where a composite contract combines quantity and freight discounts, and a free shipping contract is incorporated into the model. Here, the transportation modes of raw materials and finished products are subject to a limited capacity. The manufacturer, who faces geographically dispersed retailers, ships the ordered shipments under three different modes classified in three scenarios. In the first scenario, the shipments are shipped by identical transport modes to the retailers. In the second one, they are delivered by different transport modes in terms of their capacities regarding distance from the manufacturing site. In the third scenario, products are sent to a central warehouse for fast ship to the retailers. Demand depends on selling price and shortage is not permitted. The leader-follower game is considered between the members of the chain so that the manufacturer is a follower and the retailers are the leaders. This research aims to optimize the chain total profit concerning the selling prices and order quantities of the manufacturer and the retailers under different transport methods and a composite incentive contract. To clarify the applicability of the model, some numerical samples are presented and the effects of optimal decision policies of the chains partners are examined. © 2017 Operational Research Society.","Free shipping contract; Leader-follower game; Limited transportation capacity; Pricing quantity discount contract; Supply chain management","Commerce; Competition; Manufacture; Materials handling; Profitability; Sales; Ships; Supply chain management; Free shipping; Incentive contracts; Joint replenishment; Leader-follower games; Manufacturing sites; Quantity-discount contract; Transportation capacity; Transportation mode; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026547760

However, we still have limited understanding of how multinational enterprises (MNEs) choose – among all the countries they do business in – where to file for IP protection and where they exercise their IP rights through litigation. In this study, we examine MNEs’ strategic choices of patenting and litigation locations through the lens of global competition. We argue that, while IP protection is local, relying on local policies and institutions, firms engaging in litigation are global. Thus, they prefer to litigate in the few countries with substantial track records to send strong signals to competitors elsewhere. This is particularly true for highly concentrated industries, where the same competitors face off in various countries, and for firms with radical innovations, which require expertise for a convincing verdict. We find supportive evidence of country, industry, and firm effects from extensive interviews with industry insiders and a comprehensive dataset documenting all the IP-related activities of Fortune Global 500 companies from 2007 to 2014. We discuss how the strategic choices made by global firms, in turn, influence the effectiveness of local policies and IP harmonization efforts across countries. © 2018, Academy of International Business.","global competition; intellectual property protection; litigation; patents",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060836806

The study particularly focuses on the role of risk awareness as an ERM component within the interplay of other formal ERM components. The five ERM components result from a factor analysis applied on a list of risk management (RM) practices in nonfinancial firms. Based on survey data from 118 companies, I find evidence supporting an indirect effect of risk awareness on RM effectiveness. My analyses support that the use of RM tools strengthens the relationship between risk awareness and RM effectiveness, but I only find inconclusive evidence supporting a direct association between risk awareness and RM effectiveness. As antecedents of risk awareness, I find support for both organizational environment and reporting processes. Moreover, risk awareness carries the effects of organizational environment and reporting processes to RM effectiveness. This study shows empirically that risk awareness is a vital cultural component in a firm’s ERM system. It thus contributes to existing research in management accounting and control by providing insights into the role of risk awareness as a concept related to other ERM components. © 2018, American Accounting Association.

However, recent research finds that quality related to final testing, adjustment, and balancing of HVAC systems are often overlooked due to deadline pressure. Consequently, this results in poor energy performance and dissatisfied end-users. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between pre-planning, commissioning, and project performance. A publicly funded project with a compressed construction period was followed as a case study. During the case study, passive observation, semi-constructed interviews, and questionnaires were applied. This study showed that by implementing commissioning, project pre-planning and organizational support is increased. Moreover, the commissioning process creates awareness and fosters proactivity between the project participants, thus complications are discovered and handled earlier. By improved pre-planning and organizational support, and increasing proactivity, the project’s cost, time and quality performance is improved. This underlines the importance of prioritizing pre-planning. Moreover, increased energy and technical demands increase project complexity which makes project success even more dependent on the quality of the plans. © 2018 by the author(s).","Commissioning; Construction management; Pre-planning; Project performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051661025

A manufacturing strategy of absorbing all obvious variations and an approach of turning variations to cancel one another are defined. Verified the application feasibility and established the robustness quantification method at each stage. The theoretical and actual sensitivity of different parameters is identified as indicators.

This article uses archival sources to trace how this cluster emerged from the rubber business in the era of British and Dutch colonialism. Specifically, the rise of palm oil in this region was due to three interrelated factors: (1) the institutional environment of the existing rubber cluster; (2) an established community of foreign traders; and (3) a trading hub in Singapore that offered a multitude of advanced services. This analysis stresses the historical dimension of clusters, which has been neglected in the previous management and strategy works, by connecting cluster emergence to the business history of trading firms. The article also extends the current literature on cluster emergence by showing that the rise of this cluster occurred parallel, and intimately related, to the product specialization within international trading houses. © 2017 The Author.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048083124

Söderlund () found that customers entering a store with an employee present (vs. absent) reported significantly higher levels of customer satisfaction, with their increased levels of pleasurable feelings mediating this effect. However, similar to the majority of theorizing on customer satisfaction, that article was restricted to data collected in a Western society. Given the rapid economic growth in many Asian regions, there is a need to examine the applicability of such Western-based findings from an Asian perspective, and hence include participants from Eastern societies. Accordingly, the present research investigated whether Söderlund's () results could be replicated among Asian customers. The current work also sought to extend prior findings beyond pleasure and customer satisfaction while simultaneously documenting a boundary condition for the hitherto positive employee mere presence effects. To this end, two between-subjects experiments with a total sample of 498 Chinese customers were conducted. Study 1, which involved a shopping situation in a clothing store, replicated Söderlund's () main results and further found that employee mere presence (vs. absence) had a significant positive impact on customers’ loyalty intentions.

In any event, if one firm adopts a safety-first strategy, the other firm has higher profits and a better survival chance by maximizing expected profit.

It asks how are political processes informed and conditioned by calculative devices that mediate financialization processes? Drawing on a study of a French multinational corporation whose accounting devices – one concerning performance that requires suppliers to be ‘poor’ and another concerning risk that requires suppliers to be ‘rich’ – the article focuses on the dynamic of circuits of power. Accounting devices provide one-sided incentives by categorizing suppliers as costs, silencing the industrial rationality of the network where suppliers are the capabilities and skills needed by the multinational corporation. Such tensions put the network at risk, as when the suppliers went bankrupt, the multinational corporation was devoid of its industrial competencies. Financialization is ambiguous. Its devices are not inherently facilitative of systemic powers but reflect an ideological mode of rationality and political processes that produce overflows. The associated circuits of power show that systemic power is never eternal but dynamic. Circuits of power develop ambiguous political processes that push disruptive dynamisms of financialization processes in global production networks.

The current research investigates the relationship between distinctive consumer food-related lifestyle patterns and food waste. A survey with 848 consumers in a Northern European country (Denmark) suggests that segments of consumers identified by food-related behaviors have corresponding differences in food waste produced. For example, consumers’ food waste varies across different patterns of food-related lifestyle-dimensions, such as 1) cooking enjoyment, 2) food planning, 3) price orientation, 4) social relationships related to meals, and 5) food-safety concerns.

By contrast, recent empirical research shows the substantial influence of stakeholders on brands.

European brand research accordingly treats brands as ongoing and complex processes in constant flux. Nevertheless, literature suffers from a significant lack of theoretical underpinnings for understanding brands as complex processes; in this respect, building on European philosophy is a fruitful avenue. This paper introduces the metaphor of the rhizome and draws on European process philosophy to further develop an integrative processual understanding of brands.

However, sludge treatment reed bed systems, which are holistic sludge treatment facilities combining the dewatering, mineralisation and storage of sludge, have been more common during the last three decades. Treatment of sludge in a sludge treatment reed bed system can be combined with post-treatment (further dewatering and mineralisation) on a stockpile area. This study aimed to compare the environmental performances of a mechanical sludge treatment method with the sludge treatment reed bed system strategy, using the life cycle assessment approach and a life cycle inventory based on newly generated data obtained from Danish reference facilities. The scenarios based on the different treatment methods were initiated by sludge entering the sludge treatment reed bed system or the centrifuge and terminated by land application of the final sludge product. The environmental impacts caused by the sludge treatment reed bed system strategy were comparable to or lower than those caused by the mechanical sludge treatment method. The impacts on climate change were the same for all the treatment scenarios; however, the conversion of organic carbon and nitrogen into gas species was more efficient in the sludge treatment reed bed system compared to mechanical treatment. Thus, mechanically treated sludge contained more nitrogen, causing higher nitrogen emissions (nitrous oxide, nitrate and ammonia) when applied on land. Furthermore, the impact of resource depletion was higher for mechanical dewatering due to a larger fossil fuel demand related to daily operation and longer transportation distances in this scenario. According to the results of the life cycle assessment, there were no considerable environmental gains made by combining the treatment of sludge in a sludge treatment reed bed system with post-treatment on a stockpile area. However, some practical aspects, which are not expressed in a life cycle assessment, should also be taken into consideration when evaluating the performances of sludge treatment scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Land application; Nitrogen; Sewage sludge","Centrifuges; Climate change; Dewatering; Digital storage; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Mineralogy; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Sewage sludge; Different treatments; Environmental performance; Land applications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Mechanical dewatering; Mechanical treatments; Transportation distance; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044850731

Assuming that CEOs are high need for distinctiveness individuals, we argue that negative emotions associated with similarity to their CEO predecessors are likely to force CEO successors to engage in behavioral coping strategies aimed at restoring a sense of distinctiveness.

First, in considering government support for innovation, Sample B, based on radical innovation, played a superior and stronger role than Sample A. Secondly, for both samples, the cooperation of external firms has a positive effect on firms’ innovative performance, which was positively controlled by the size of the firms. Thirdly, in general, radical innovation requires synergy and a more intense focus regarding the constructs considered therein.

We find that higher decision-making autonomy increases the probability of a subsidiary developing a product innovation. This effect is particularly pronounced, but not restricted to, decision-making in the area of R&D or the adoption of technologies. The positive effect extends also to functional areas such as investment, finance, supplier selection as well as marketing and sales.

While an increasing number of studies is being published every year, an overview of the field is missing. Researchers, practitioners, and policy makers are often using ambiguous wording and have not yet reached consensus on the terminology and concepts involved. This state of affairs leads to research fragmentation and lack of knowledge convergence. For the purpose of contributing to knowledge synthesis and consolidation, this article provides a structured review of the literature on innovation in public procurement. From categorizing publications based on innovation drivers, concepts, and research approaches, the emerging structure of the field is described and synthesized into a framework of innovation in public procurement. The proposed framework differentiates between literature streams on (1) innovations in the public procurement process, (2) innovation of public services by means of procurement, and (3) the use of public procurement as a tool for demand-side innovation policy-making. For each of these streams of literature, different focus areas as well as research gaps and opportunities for future research are identified. Based on analysis of existing research, the proposed framework provides an overview of state-of-the-art knowledge, a unified terminology, and a holistic understanding of innovation in public procurement. The framework is both a point of departure for future research and a source of knowledge for practitioners. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Framework; Innovation; Policy; Public procurement","Decision making; Public policy; Framework; Innovation policies; Knowledge synthesis; Point of departures; Public procurement; Research approach; State of the art; Structured review; Terminology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042849396

We extend the analysis beyond standard metrics of firm performance such as revenue and growth to study intermediate investments, including product innovation, worker training, and adoption of workplace safety measures that are potentially conducive to observed firm performance. Our results show that innovativeness and locus of control are positively correlated with revenue while risk aversion predicts lower revenue. Risk aversion is positively correlated with the adoption of safety measures. Innovativeness, as expected, is associated with an increased probability of product innovations. An internal locus of control predicts higher probability of investments, innovations and worker training. Heterogeneity analyses indicate that innovativeness and risk aversion matter more for firm outcomes in provinces characterized by better business climate. Our results are robust to a variety of checks.

This paper examines how different information management professionals access and use PKR. It is a multiple case study, with 43 semi-structured interviews and an analysis of strategic documents. The purpose is to shed light on strategic intentions with PKR, its collaborative tasks and qualities. A conceptual model was built for this purpose. The aim is to better understand how PKR works and to examine how information on education, training and the skills of employees is managed in organizations. The findings demonstrate that organizational strategies portray elaborate intentions regarding knowledge seeking and sharing, while less emphasis is put on knowledge registration or management. Interviewees expressed lack of appropriate actions to support PKR. Access and use of PKR is limited and the organizations still struggle to manage the PKR of their employees. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Collaboration; Information management; Knowledge management; Personal knowledge registration (PKR); Training strategies","Information management; Information use; Personnel training; Collaboration; Collaborative tasks; Management professionals; Organizational strategy; Personal knowledge registration (PKR); Semi structured interviews; Strategic intention; Training strategy; Knowledge management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041453590

Known as “expat-preneurs,” and in spite of their growing numbers, this segment of the immigrant entrepreneur population has received far less attention than other types of immigrants in the international and diaspora entrepreneurship literature, and even less attention in the self-initiated expatriate field of study. In this article, we seek to address the gap in empirical studies about expat-preneurs as an important, albeit under-researched, segment of the immigrant entrepreneur and self-initiated expatriate diaspora. While we acknowledge that there may be controversy as to how our entrepreneurship lens is accepted in the international entrepreneurship domain, we see particular value in engaging with the ongoing and emerging discussion within JIEN about what international entrepreneurship can be. To advance the study of expat-preneurs from a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate empirically that aggregating various kinds of self-initiated expatriates without first ensuring that they are demographically comparable (i.e., that there can be different types) can potentially contribute to poor construct clarity and validity about this field of research in general. More importantly, it can diminish the important role of expat-preneurs in particular within the international entrepreneurship domain, for example, by ignoring that their motivation to engage in entrepreneurial activity differs from the majority of necessity-based diaspora entrepreneurs. To illustrate our point, we surveyed self-initiated expatriates in China, Hong Kong, and Singapore and compared personal characteristics. We found differences regarding their age, position, time in current job in the host location, time as an expatriate, and time in the host location overall to suggest that not all self-initiated expatriates are the same. While we found no intergroup differences for educational level, gender, or marital status, clear distinctions emerged showing that expat-preneurs are different from company-employed self-initiated expatriates. We discuss theoretical implications arising from these findings. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Business expatriates; Construct clarity expatriates; Expat-preneur; International entrepreneurship; Self-initiated expatriate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036549176

International business literature has addressed many types of distance that may affect (service) offshoring, such as cultural or geographic distance. However, limited emphasis has been placed on the implications of differing cognitions of individuals that produce a cognitive distance (CD). We address this gap and ask how increased CD through offshoring affects KIBS production processes. This conceptual paper focuses on how CD interacts with the modularity of different process stages in service production and what effect CD has on repeated production processes. In order to do so we first predict what stages of KIBS production processes can be offshored and what implications offshoring has on these services. We contribute to literature by deepening the understanding of CD and providing a process perspective on KIBS offshoring that looks at modularity within services, rather than firms as bundles of modular production, and on the impact repeated production processes have on service characteristics. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive distance; Knowledge-intensive business services; Offshoring; Service modularity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035202491

For this study, semi-structured interviews and workshops with different experiments were conducted. Using low-fidelity prototypes, our results indicated that there are differences in the early phase of prototyping. Engineers focused on the features and functions of a prototype and needed to meet specific goals in order to push the process forward. Designers, on the other hand, used prototypes to investigate the design space for new possibilities, and were more open to a variety of prototyping materials and tools, especially for low-fidelity prototypes. In the later prototyping phases, the prototyping behaviors of engineers and designers became similar.

It describes and discusses recent policy trends that move away from emphasizing developing country benefits toward the pursuit of ‘mutual benefit’ as the key motivating factor and aim for development cooperation as an area of public policy. A mix of motivations has always driven development cooperation, yet the current policy trend differs in that such motivations are made explicit. As a consequence, recent policies suggest that these different interests represent ‘win-wins’ rather than trade-offs and conceptualize a common development agenda for the donor and recipient countries. Given that political discourse promotes and prepares legal and accountability systems, public scrutiny and independent evaluation are a few steps behind and largely restricted to analyzing benefits for developing countries. The article argues that articulating all goals of development cooperation can facilitate evaluation practice in this changed setting, as effects considered to be ‘unintended’ from the perspective of promoting development goals may, in fact, be intentional or anticipated from a mutual benefit perspective. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Aid effectiveness; Development policy; Development studies; Evaluation; Mutual benefit; Unintended effects","aid flow; developing world; policy analysis; policy development; adult; developing country; human; motivation; public policy; recipient; behavior; developing country; international cooperation; procedures; program development; program evaluation; public policy; standards; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Humans; Intention; International Cooperation; Motivation; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Public Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029596676

Purchasing managers face a difficult decision in determining how to select responsible suppliers so they can maintain their firm's competitive advantage in the contemporary business environment. Firms need to satisfy not only the views of society but also to consider the opinions of all stakeholders to stay profitable and to create a supportive business strategy. Existing studies fail to provide a model for socially responsible supplier selection, particularly when various actors are involved. To fill this gap, this study proposes a model to select the best supplier based on their corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and to identify the key actors (Shareholder, Governments, Customers, and Community) whose perspective is vital. We utilize a hybrid multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approach; however, the supplier selection portion relies on a pure decision making process with consideration of multiple criteria. This study proposes the model in three phases as follows. In the first phase, the collected common CSR practices are scrutinized through fuzzy Delphi with the assistance of experts’ opinions. In second phase, the interdependencies, interrelationship and weights of CSR practices are analysed through DEMATEL-ANP (DANP). The final phase proceeds with the selection of the best alternative (supplier) based on CSR practices through PROMETHEE. The proposed model is validated with the case illustration and the results are discussed with feedback from the case purchasing managers. Finally, the study ends by identifying managerial implications and its limitations, and we provide some useful future insights which will increase the effective integration of CSR in supply chains and especially in the supplier selection process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","CSR practices; Hybrid MCDM; Multi-stakeholders; Supplier selection","Competition; Decision making; Managers; Sales; Supply chains; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); CSR practices; Decision making process; Hybrid MCDM; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-stakeholder; Supplier selection; Supplier selection process; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008477664

Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a qualitative method and draws upon interviews with 30 TAWs from four agencies in the south of Denmark in order to link the experiences, as narrated by Danish TAWs, to their identity. Findings: The study unpacks the components of the TAWs’ work-related identity and provides an understanding of the self-notions that the TAWs mobilize to respond to the conditions of temporary agency work. It identifies six components of work-related identity: Being new and unfamiliar, demonstrating the ability to adapt, dealing with uncertainty, feeling inferior and marginalized, pursuing opportunities, and the necessity to impress others. Both the agency and the user-firm try to regulate the TAWs’ identity as they expect agency workers to be flexible and adaptable persons, who possess a high degree of self-control. In so doing they provide a template for identification that the workers have to respond to. The study shows that TAWs develop this identity along two dimensions: their liminal position between the agency and the user-firm; and prescribed identity templates as TAWs strive for autonomy and craft their own work-related identity. Practical implications: There are managerial challenges with regard to motivation, tensions between temps and permanent staff, low levels of organizational commitment, well-being, and the performance of TAWs. These challenges can be better understood (and probably solved) when agencies and user-firms would take into account the agency workers’ struggle for identification. The paper demonstrates that the work-related identity of TAWs not only has consequences for their performance but also for their whole life. Furthermore, the constitution of agency workers as flexible resource has consequences for HRM in the user-firm. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the limited amount of knowledge about the meanings that TAWs reflexively attach to themselves as they seek to make sense of the conditions of temporary agency work. Investigating their work-related identity helps to better understand the implications of temporary agency work based on the investigation of the agency workers’ experiences. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agency workers; Denmark; HRM; Identity; Social identification; Temporary agency employment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051260009

PDs enable interactions between policy makers, researchers and other stakeholders – one of the factors associated with promoting evidence-informed policy making. Design/methodology/approach: This is an exploratory study based on semi-structured interviews with ten key informants from sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, North and South America. Participants were purposefully sampled based on their experience in facilitating or observing PDs organized by the WHO’s Evidence-informed Policy Network. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method. Findings: A successful PD relies on a structured process used to catalyze impact. Facilitators contribute to a successful PD through their facilitation skills, for example, helping to get to an informed judgment; knowledge, for example, about the health system; attitudes, for example, valuing the PD process over its outcomes; and personal attributes, for example, credibility. Facilitators’ involvement in preparatory and follow-up actions are equally paramount for a PD’s success. Challenges in implementing PDs can be prevented/attenuated, for example, through stakeholder analysis to identify suitable PD participants, and anticipate power constellations or potential conflicts. Research limitations/implications: Research should focus on the overall process of a PD – especially on preparation and follow-up activities and their influence on a PD’s success. Originality/value: Informed by harnessing practical experiences, this paper outlines facilitators’ skills, attributes, attitudes, knowledge and how these can be used to influence a PD’s success. © 2018, World Health Organization (2018).

Design/methodology/approach: Hypothesized relationships are tested using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping mediation analysis based on a multi-national survey with 273 managers while drawing on the theory of knowledge management and literature streams of individual competencies in the fields of SCM and human resource management (HRM), respectively. Findings: The analysis reveals that individual SCM competencies and organizational SCM knowledge positively influence SCM performance to a similar magnitude. Moreover, organizational learning enhances individual competencies and organizational knowledge significantly and equally while corporate training programs fall surprisingly short of expectations. The disentanglement of SCM competencies renders HRM’s contribution to SCM visible by revealing the impact of HRM and learning practices on competencies, knowledge, and performance. Research limitations/implications: To validate the findings, future research could apply different research methods such as case studies and focus on more countries to reduce potential methodological and regional biases. Practical implications: The results suggest that corporate training programs need further development. Organizational learning’s strong direct and indirect effects have two main implications: first, it should serve as motivation for organizations to constantly improve their learning capabilities. Second, these only tap its true potential for enhancing SCM performance if they first elevate individual competencies and organizational knowledge.

In an experimental survey collected in Denmark, respondents were exposed to either a positive or a negative message on three issues in a random order; this creates a setting where we can test for the effects of eight different sequences of positive and/or negative messages. We find consistent effects. Being exposed to a higher volume of negative messages often depresses evaluations of the target, whereas being exposed to a higher volume of positive messages enhances evaluation of the sponsor. These effects are nuanced by recency effects: when a sequence ends on a negative message, regardless of its overall valence, evaluation of the target is depressed; similarly, negatively valenced sequences harm the target except when the sequence ends on a positive message. Backlash effects are unlikely, and no sequence simultaneously harms the target and promotes a positive evaluation of the sponsor. Finally, negatively valenced sequences of messages enhance perceptions of negativity, whereas positively valenced sequences do not reduce it; this trend is also nuanced by recency effects. © 2018 The Author(s).

Our analysis derives the optimal policies and shows that they take the form of contingence model in which the policies depend on consumer initial return and NE return. We also examine the influence of the consumer return NE effect on buy-back contracts of the supply chain and show that while the traditional buy-back contract fails to coordinate the supply chain, the NE effect does not render the differentiated buy-back contract less effective. Finally, we extend our study to a heterogeneous consumer case. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","behavioural operation management; buy-back contract; network externality; return policy; Supply chain coordination","Sales; Buy back contracts; Network externality; Operation management; Return policy; Supply chain coordination; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040960767

The purpose of this paper is to contribute to planning literature by investigating how the production system and the planning environment influence the performance difference between hierarchical and monolithic planning. Further, it seeks to reduce the prevailing theory-practice gap in tactical planning. Design/methodology/approach: Through an action research study, a monolithic model integrating tactical production planning decisions, subject to upstream supply chain constraints, with strategic investments decisions was developed, tested and implemented in a global OEM. Using the developed model and a measure of the capital cost of production assets relative to the cost of holding inventory, it is numerically examined how the production system and planning environment influence the performance of hierarchical and monolithic planning. Findings: The research demonstrates the potential of integrating decisions and reveals significant performance differences between hierarchical and monolithic planning for firms with low capital cost relative to inventory holding cost. Research limitations/implications: The findings suggest a fit between planning processes, the production system and planning environment. Future research should empirically validate the findings and propositions.

Ambitions to fulfill one of these two objectives might not exclude the other. Instead, they could and should be achieved simultaneously. However, what seems to be missing in supply chain management (SCM) research is the unfolding of symmetrical balance between the two dimensions of relevance – theoretical vs practical relevance. The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of this symmetrical balance and to change the conversation to also include the practical relevance dimension. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on literature studies as well as the results of a questionnaire survey distributed to the Danish Supply Chain Panel consisting of 113 supply chain executives (as per the beginning of 2017). A short interview about the questionnaire results was also carried out with three panel members. Findings: With an increased focus on journal rankings, there is a risk of pursuing more theoretically relevant SCM research at the expense of practically relevant SCM research. Both types of relevance are important for growing the discipline. But the current development seems to favor theoretical relevance, further widening the gap with respect to practical applications. Practical relevance is important both in the knowledge production and in the knowledge transfer stages. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to further explore different resources to close the gap between theoretical and practical relevance in SCM research. Researchers ought to follow an ambidextrous research strategy. This paper advises to bring back the core of the profession – the research process. This paper encourages researchers to be more creative and intensify the focus, equally, on both the theoretical and practical relevance in their research. Practical implications: This research showcases a variety of different approaches for researchers to engage with practice so as to reduce any prejudices from both sides and enhance SCM decision-making processes. This paper recommends adding a new type of paper “practical paper” and including practitioners in the review board to evaluate the practical content of the research paper. This initiative would strengthen the interaction between researchers and practitioners. Originality/value: This paper provides new insights on the need for symmetrical balance between theoretical and practical relevance being important for both academia and practice. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Journal ranking; Relevance; Rigor; Supply chain panel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043486273

The purpose of this paper is to explore the benefits of museum visits and engage in arts activities for mental health service users. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 mental health service users in Denmark. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data and theoretical lens of sociological theories of institutional logics was employed to explore the findings. Findings: These benefits are perceived to include empowerment and meaning in life, which are two of the core principles of recovery; arts engagement can, therefore, be a useful tool in recovery. The findings also show that the experience of visiting a museum was not always positive and depended upon the interaction with the museum educators. Originality/value: The service users identified arts engagement as creating meaning in life and empowerment, which are two element in the conceptual framework, CHIME (an acronym for: Connectedness, Hope and optimism, Identity, Meaning in life and Empowerment), that describes the human process of recovery. The findings also highlighted that if museums want to engage positively with people with mental health problems and contribute to their recovery then the training of staff and the improvement of institutional approaches to support working with vulnerable people are essential. © 2018, Anita jensen.","Arts and health; Arts engagement; Mental health; Museum/gallery; Recovery",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045832077

Design/methodology/approach: A range of consumption functions are estimated on the basis of household-level data from the Expenditure and Saving Survey of 1931. Findings: The estimations show significant negative marginal effects of various measures of leverage on homeowners’ non-durable consumption. The magnitude of the estimated effects suggests that leverage contributed significantly to the economic downturn during the Great Depression by depressing consumer spending of homeowners. Practical implications: Gross debt levels of homeowners are not only of direct importance for financial stability but also have implications for macroeconomic stability, which again might affect the stability of the financial system.

The simplistic contrast between markets and states as sources of income renders invisible the relations of dependence established in our basic economic institutions such as the family, property, and money. This book is a work of political theory that attacks narrow conceptions of dependence and identifies distinct senses of dependence that might allow political communities to make clearer decisions about the justice of our economic institutions and practices. Inheritance, for example, is as much a form of dependence as support by a welfare state, but these are never compared in debates about economic justice. This book begins the work of comparing forms of economic dependence, and argues that economic dependence is always an issue of both vulnerability and parasitism. It builds bridges between political theory and social science, and is of relevance to those concerned with social and economic justice in and beyond contemporary capitalist welfare states. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s).",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053653343

We use survey data from a sample of 356 farmers based on multistage random sampling. Factor analysis is employed to classify scores of risk and management strategies, and multiple regression is then used to investigate the relationship between scores and farmers’ characteristics. The results demonstrate that shortage of family labor, high price of fodder, and limited farm income were perceived as the most important risks. Use of veterinary services, parasite control, and loan utilization were perceived as the most important strategies for managing risks. Livestock disease and labor shortage were perceived as less of a risk by farmers who adopted the practice of zero grazing compared to other farmers, pointing to the potential of this practice for risk reduction. We find strong evidence that farmers engage in multiple risk management practices in order to reduce losses from cattle morbidity and mortality.

Objective instrumented measures of injury risk factors with synchronised video-based task analyses were used to examine changes in operators’ RSI risk during two cases of engineering innovation: (1) a shift in industrial model from traditional extracting saleable parts to line-based full material recovery, and (2) the prospective effects of a simulated ‘Lean’-inspired process improvement in the line system. Both cases of innovation showed significantly increased movement speeds and reduced muscular recovery opportunities, implying increased RSI risk. This case study reveals a mechanism by which innovation may increase RSI risks for operators. Managers responsible for engineering innovation should ensure their teams have the tools and mandate necessary to control injury hazards as part of the development and design process. These cases suggest how failure to manage RSI hazards in the innovation process may allow increases of injury risks that can compromise operational performance. This ‘innovation pitfall’ has implications for operator health and organisational sustainability.

Realizing these critical issues, the impact investment has emerged as a new asset class, which has bundled entrepreneurial passion with available scarce resources to design and implement cost-effective, reliable and scalable market solutions for the BoP creating essential public goods. The empirical context involves the use of case studies of impact-investing firms, which have made a socio-economic difference in the lives of the rural and semi-urban population lying at the BoP in India through impact investments in social enterprises. The analysis and findings reflect the key operating principles of favourable impact-investing in the business ventures at the BoP.

Extending current ambidexterity theory, we suggest that not only firms pursuing one-sided exploration or exploitation orientations show self-reinforcing tendencies but also ambidextrous firms adopting balanced exploration- exploitation orientations. Integrating formal modeling arguments,we further propose that reinforcing ambidexterity can be good or bad for firms' long-term performance, depending on the environment they face: In contexts characterized by incremental change, firms benefit more from the learning effects of maintaining ambidexterity, which lead to superior performance. Firms in discontinuous change contexts, however, suffer more from the misalignment that reinforcement creates, which affects their performance negatively. A longitudinal data set of global insurance firms (1999-2014) supports our arguments. Building on these findings, we reconceptualize ambidexterity as the ability to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation, which emerges from combining capabilitybuilding processes (to balance exploration and exploitation) with capability-shifting processes (to adapt the exploration-exploitation balance).We contribute to the organizational literature by developing a dynamic perspective on balancing exploration and exploitation, by clarifying the contingent nature of the ambidexterity-firm performance relationship, and by integrating and extending the ambidexterity and formal modeling perspectives on exploration and exploitation. © 2018 INFORMS.","Ambidexterity; Exploitation; Exploration; Formal modeling; Learning; Organizational adaptation; Paradox",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048108756

In other words, organizations may be paradoxical. However, paradoxes do not pre-exist as a matter of fact. This article investigates how dominant academic discourses either constitute or deny potential paradoxes of Corporate Social Responsibility. It follows the theoretical perspective of CCO – Communication Constitutes Organizations and, more specifically, a ventriloqual approach. Academics are like ventriloquists, they breath life into dummies who establish theoretical figures that may or may not support paradoxical thinking in organizational research. The qualitative meta-analysis shows that potential Corporate Social Responsibility paradoxes are primarily talked into nonexistence. Managerial ventriloquists reject Corporate Social Responsibility tensions in the interests of organizational consistency and harmony. Critical ventriloquists accept tensions, but assume their causes lie in gaps between rhetoric and practice. The preferred figure is not a paradoxical one, but that of organizational hypocrisy. Overall, non-paradoxical approaches dominate; they, in turn, ventriloquize their creators, thereby limiting the scope of future research. A communicative perspective is instead open to the constitution of Corporate Social Responsibility paradoxes. It enables practitioners to engage in a proactive management of organizational tensions and encourages scholars to reflect on the constituted nature of academic discourses. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Communication Constitutes Organizations; Corporate Social Responsibility; critical research; managerialism; paradox; ventriloquism","article; breathing; human; human experiment; meta analysis; organization; physician; social responsibility; tension; theoretical study; thinking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046821379

Research Question/Issue: Does foundation ownership lead to long-term corporate governance and business behavior in foundation-owned companies?. Research Findings/Insights: Short-termism has become a serious concern for corporate governance, and this has inspired a search for institutional arrangements to promote long-term decision-making. In this paper, we call attention to long-term ownership by industrial foundations, which is common in Northern Europe but little known in the rest of the world. We use a unique Danish data set to document that industrial foundations are long-term owners that practice long-term governance. We show that foundation ownership is highly stable compared to other ownership structures. Foundation-owned companies replace managers less frequently. They have conservative capital structures with low financial leverage. They score higher on an index of long-termism in finance, investment, and employment. They survive longer. Overall, our paper supports the hypothesis that corporate time horizons are influenced by ownership structures, and particularly that industrial foundations possess characteristics that promote long-termism. Policymakers, business owners, and managers interested in promoting long-term governance models should therefore reconsider the role of ownership structure. Theoretical/Academic Implications: This paper supports the hypothesis that time horizons are influenced by ownership commitment and particularly that industrial foundations promote long-termism. We contribute to the corporate governance literature by further developing the concept of long-termism as a multi-faceted corporate governance concept associated with ownership commitment. We also show that foundation ownership is associated with long-termism. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Policymakers interested in promoting long-termism should encourage long-term ownership, for example by industrial foundations. Practitioners should consider the importance of ownership commitment in ensuring long-term corporate governance. © 2018 The Authors Corporate Governance: An International Review Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Corporate Governance; Industrial Foundations; Long-termism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045902098

This article draws on a qualitative case study of the Ericsson system “Idea Boxes” to explore a novel approach to manage ideation based on the use of the moderator role. The aim of this study is to understand to what extent and how the introduction of moderators can contribute to a better management of web-enabled ideation systems and to overcome the shortcomings commonly associated with their use. The contribution of this study to innovation literature is threefold. First, it develops a conceptual framework that gives insights into the practices implemented by moderators to manage ideation, namely: (1) formulating an ideation strategy, (2) combining means for community building, and (3) formalizing the ideation process. It focuses on unfolding their key complementarities. Second, this study relates these practices to the shortcomings of web-enabled ideation systems with respect to the sourcing, filtering, and handling of employees' ideas. It discusses how the identified practices can help organizations address these shortcomings by stimulating sustained employee participation, increasing the quality and fit of the ideas generated, and ensuring their efficient selection and integration. Third, this article compares moderators to other innovation roles discussed in the new product development literature with the aim of broadening the future research agenda toward an investigation of emerging organizational roles having limited formal authority to manage innovation. The findings of this study provide valuable guidelines to managers to implement more sophisticated approaches for a better management of the ideation process through web-enabled ideation tools. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association",,"Product development; Collective intelligences; Community buildings; Conceptual frameworks; Employee participation; New product development; Qualitative case studies; Research agenda; Web enabled; Moderators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045877405

This study aims to provide insight in the prevalence and consequences of taking a more active strategy, professional coping. Next to traditional forms of coping studied in public administration, studying active coping can result in more insight in when and with what consequences frontline employees speak up and resist pressures. We explore to what degree teachers use speaking out using professional norms as a way to tackle the pressures they face. Moreover, we analyze the relationship between professional coping, work engagement, and intent to leave as important indicators of how immersed frontline employees are in their work. Using survey data (n = 1,270) from primary school teachers, we conclude that professional coping is in general regularly but not very often applied, but that professional coping is related to higher work engagement and lower intent to leave. We conclude that studying active coping strategies can not only be important for street-level literature in gaining insight in all types of behavior and their consequences but also for public service providers aiming for an engaged workforce. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","coping; professionalism; street-level bureaucracy; work engagement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045652695

The company that is considered is allowed to distribute excess profits (traditionally referred to as dividends in the literature), but is regulated and is subject to particular regulatory (solvency) constraints. Because of the bivariate nature of the surplus formulation, such distributions of excess profits can take two alternative forms. These can originate from a reduction of assets (and hence a payment to owners), but also from an increase of liabilities (when these represent the wealth of owners, such as in pension funds). The latter is particularly relevant if distributions of assets do not make sense because of the context, such as in regulated pension funds where assets are locked until retirement. In this paper, we extend the model of Gerber and Shiu (2003) and consider recovery requirements for the distribution of excess funds. Such recovery requirements are an extension of the plain vanilla solvency constraints considered in Paulsen (2003), and require funds to reach a higher level of funding than the solvency level (if and after it is triggered) before excess funds can be distributed again. We obtain closed-form expressions for the expected present value of distributions (asset decrements or liability increments) when a distribution barrier is used. © Copyright Astin Bulletin 2018.","Dividends; Funding ratio; Recovery requirements; Regulation; Solvency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045221676

We therefore analysed the drivers of this transformation and its impacts on livelihoods between 1995 and 2014 in two villages located in Eastern Central Tanzania by combining analysis of socio-economic and remote sensing data. Results revealed that in an upland village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 34% to 16% and the area changed from 19% to 17%. In a plateau village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 24% to 18% and the area substantially declined from 23% to 14%. In both villages, shifting cultivators adopted intensive land preparation methods that involved deep tillage and burying of vegetation. Transformation of shifting cultivation in the upland area was driven by adoption and enforcement of land tenure policies that restrict shifting cultivation whereas in the plateau area, it was driven by population pressure causing competition for land between shifting cultivators and pastoralists. In both villages transformation of shifting cultivation negatively affected household income and increased periods of food insecurity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Household survey; Land use change; Object Based Image Analysis; Slash-and-burn","food security; household income; household survey; image analysis; land use change; livelihood; pastoralism; shifting cultivation; village; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044468384

Most manufacturers prefer outsourcing, so this study proposes a benchmarked recovery process for third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP) by evaluating design criteria, implementation criteria, process control characteristics, and business orientation policies. Expertise efficiency of third party providers dictates their competitiveness and/or survival. In an effort to help third parties enhance value recovery from the process in the market, this paper seeks to establish a meaningful benchmark that will dictate best practices through quality function deployment (QFD). In particular, the paper offers a theoretical background to measure the relative importance among the various types of criteria. The proposed technique also helps to establish guidelines by which to prioritize the various characteristics. This study finds that the main driving factor regarding waste management centers on mandatory laws. It also concludes that when government relaxes its policies, environmentally oriented businesses are able to strengthen their systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Benchmarking; Quality Function Deployment (QFD); Third party reverse logistics providers (3PRLP)","Benchmarking; Computer system recovery; Function evaluation; Manufacture; Quality function deployment; Recovery; Waste management; Control characteristics; Design criteria; Process analysis; Quality function deployments (QFD); Recovery network; Recovery process; Reverse logistics; Third-party reverse logistics; Logistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043577109

Effective governance necessitates the generation of concise information on the costs-effectiveness of policy instruments aimed at reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) approach is a framework commonly used to summarise information of potential mitigation effort, and can help in identifying the most cost-effective managerial and technological GHG mitigation options. Agriculture offers key opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions and utilise carbon (C) sink potentials. Therefore, a number of countries have developed national agricultural MACCs in the last decade. Whilst these MACCs have undoubtedly been catalysers for the information exchange between science and policy, they have also accentuated a range of constraints and limitations. In response, each of the scientific teams developed solutions in an attempt to address one or more of these limitations. These solutions represent ‘lessons learned’ which are invaluable for the development of future MACCs. To consolidate and harness this knowledge that has heretofore been dispersed across countries, this paper reviews the engineering agricultural MACCs developed in European countries. We collate the state-of-the-art, review the lessons learnt, and provide a more coherent framework for countries or research groups embarking on a trajectory to develop an agricultural MACC that assesses mitigations both within the farm gate and to the wider bioeconomy. We highlight the contemporary methodological developments, specifically on 1) the emergence of stratified MACCs; 2) accounting for soil carbon sequestration 3) accounting for upstream and downstream emissions; 4) the development of comprehensive cost-calculations; 5) accounting for environmental co-effects and 6) uncertainty analyses. We subsequently discuss how the mitigation potential summarised by MACCs can be incentivised in practice and how this mitigation can be captured in national inventories. We conclude that the main purpose of engineering MACCs is not necessarily the accurate prediction of the total abatement potential and associated costs, but rather the provision of a coherent forum for the complex discussions surrounding agricultural GHG mitigation, and to visualise opportunities and low-hanging fruit in a single graphic and manuscript. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Greenhouse gas emissions; Marginal abatement cost curves; Methodology","Agriculture; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Uncertainty analysis; Abatement potentials; Accurate prediction; Atmospheric greenhouse; Information exchanges; International policies; Marginal abatement cost curves; Methodology; Soil carbon sequestration; Cost benefit analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043569698

Ultrasonic humidification can reduce these post-harvest losses, but it is currently unknown whether implementing the technology in practice improves the environmental performance of the supply chains. Here, using life cycle assessment we showed that ultrasonic humidification has the potential to reduce environmental impacts, including climate change impacts, of selected fruits and vegetables in Europe by up to 23% compared to conventional supply chains. The greatest potential is obtained when humidifiers are applied to fruits and vegetables chains with total inherent losses higher than 24% and when humidifiers allow reducing post-harvest losses in each post-harvest stage by 20% or more. Our results suggest that humidification may be an attractive technology for making supply chain management more sustainable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Food loss; Food supply; Food waste; Humidification; Life cycle assessment; Ultrasonic","Climate change; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Food storage; Food supply; Fruits; Harvesting; Life cycle; Supply chain management; Ultrasonics; Vegetables; Climate change impact; Environmental performance; Food loss; Food waste; Humidification; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Refrigerated storages; Technology-in-practice; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043569369

The study is based on a large-scale survey of perceptual data from 233 senior managers in manufacturing companies. Furthermore, secondary performance data of return on capital employed is included in the analysis. Companies that have an explicit corporate manufacturing strategy report better operational performance in terms of product quality, lead time and flexibility than companies that do not have such a strategy. The analysis does not reveal any differences in productivity among companies that have offshored, backshored, or maintained manufacturing at home. Companies that have offshored manufacturing report lower unit costs than companies that have applied a staying at home strategy. No significant level of difference in unit costs was found when comparing companies that have backshored manufacturing and companies that have maintained manufacturing at home. Companies that have offshored manufacturing report that they can extract detailed component, product and process data from their cost-accounting systems to a higher degree. The paper stresses the importance of access to, and the quality of, cost-accounting data to make informed strategic manufacturing decisions, and how such decisions may affect operational and cost performance.

We develop an alternative and more active view of the role of senior management in the opportunity formation process in which senior management intervenes in the entrepreneurial process to resolve coordination and collaboration problems across initiatives and decide on resource allocation. We proffer rival hypotheses concerning the effect of such senior management involvement in the entrepreneurial process. Specifically, we hypothesize that the positive relations between bottom-up initiative/employee diversity and opportunity formation are positively (negatively) moderated by such direct involvement by senior management. We examine these ideas using two matched data sources: a double-respondent survey of CEOs and HR managers and employer–employee register data. We find support for the view that senior management involvement positively moderates the relations between bottom-up processes/diversity and opportunity formation. Managerial Summary: What are the processes through which entrepreneurial opportunities emerge in established companies? Research has pointed to diversity and bottom-up initiative, but our understanding is limited with respect to what senior managers should do to optimally promote entrepreneurship in such companies. In one view, senior management should keep a distance and limit their involvement to picking the best opportunities out of those they are presented with in the bottom-up process. In contrast, we argue that given bottom-up initiative in the context of a diverse workforce, senior management should play a more direct role in the entrepreneurial process. The reason is that senior-management involvement at early stages of the opportunity formation process is required to handle the management challenges arising from diversity and bottom-up initiative. Overall, our study suggests that firms that wish to seize the potential benefits (in terms of entrepreneurial opportunities) of having a more diverse workforce and more bottom-up initiative need senior managers that directly engage in the entrepreneurial process.

A better understanding of how transformational leadership functions in organizations therefore requires a deeper application of theory from the field of communications. This article explores the question of what communication behaviors facilitate transformational leadership. A media richness framework is applied to propose that transformational leaders will be most effective when employing a face-to-face dialogue approach to communication.

Both knowledge types are often located outside the firm and need to be absorbed in order for innovation to occur. While there has been extensive research into absorptive capacity for solution knowledge, a necessary complement − absorptive capacity for new customer needs − has been neglected. In an individual-level study of 864 employees from a home appliance firm, we show that need absorptive capacity is theoretically and empirically distinct from solution absorptive capacity, and that both are positively associated with employee innovativeness. Interestingly, we find asymmetric extra-domain effects: prior solution knowledge is positively related to need absorptive capacity (cross-pollination effect), while prior need knowledge is negatively related to solution absorptive capacity (attenuation effect). We contrast the cognitive underpinnings of the two absorptive capacity types, contributing to emerging scholarly thinking on the domain-specificity and micro foundations of absorptive capacity. © 2018 The Authors","Absorptive capacity; Individual level; Innovativeness; Need knowledge; Quantitative; Solution knowledge","Engineering; Absorptive capacity; Individual levels; Innovativeness; Need knowledge; Quantitative; Domestic appliances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042190526

Using multiple case studies, we find that, dependent on task interdependent service types, implying different client interactions (firm-external determinants), organizational capabilities are developed. More specifically, reciprocal task interdependent services generate human capital and management capabilities, while sequential task interdependent services generate organizational capital and management capabilities. Moreover, we find a relationship between the capabilities, where the deficient development of one capability can be mitigated by the development of another capability (firm-internal determinants). Grounded in organization and service production theory, the article contributes to the thematic literature on service offshoring and the literature on organizational capabilities, with a particular focus on emerging market firms. Managerial Summary: Offshore outsourcing of advanced services is contributing to the development of capabilities for client firms, but is also expected to benefit service provider firms from emerging markets. Thus, we study how offshore outsourcing of services contributes to the development of these capabilities for service provider firms. We find that the characteristics of the services, which are causing different interactions with the client, help the firm develop a variety of capabilities. These capabilities affect the management, employees, and organization of service provider firms. Although the developed competencies are not a solution for all business development challenges of emerging market firms, the implications of this study could lead to competitive advantages for the firms if fully explored and exploited.

Fruits and vegetables are part of a healthy diet as important source of nutrients, but their intakes are lower than the recommendations in European countries. This study aimed to compare the choices made by adolescents and older people between three similar dishes, one based on meat, one on fish and one on vegetables, in two different conditions: a neutral (control) situation and an intervention situation in which the vegetable-based meal was designated ‘dish of the day’. The comparisons of choices will be made within the same age group (adolescents in the control group vs. adolescents in the intervention group; older people in the control group vs. older people in the intervention group). A quasi-randomised field trial design was used with a sample of 94 adolescents (aged 10–19 years) and 97 older people (aged ≥65 years), who were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. In the control situation participants were asked to choose between three similar meals, one meat, one fish and one the VeggiEat dish. In the intervention, the VeggiEat dish was labelled the ‘Dish of the day’. All dishes were provided free of charge, displayed side by side in the same order and served in same portions. The dish choices showed no differences between the control and intervention groups in both age groups, and no differences were found among the other variables analysed. This nudging strategy, ‘dish of the day’, seems not to work for the Danish sample of adolescents and older people. Future nudging studies with these populations are needed in order to find the best strategy to move adolescents' and older people's food habits toward a healthier pattern. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adolescents; dish of the day; nudging; older people; vegetables consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041094764

The article finds that gender matching has a positive effect on citizen outcomes and that this effect is partly explained by an increased level of effort on the part of the citizen.

This transformation brought about changes in the consumption practices of Vietnamese consumers. Despite several studies focusing on these changes, the impact of the government's politics on young Vietnamese consumers’ consumption practices has been largely unexamined. This study explores how young Vietnamese consumers develop and express their self-identity through their everyday consumption practices. Our findings from in-depth interviews and participatory observation indicate that consumption fosters reflexive self-awareness concerning the young consumers’ competences, body sensitivities, and distinctive tastes in response to the control exerted by the government. The findings also reveal that young Vietnamese consumers use their everyday consumption practices to achieve individualization through self-emancipation, self-enrichment, and self-actualization, and to achieve socialization through self-authentication and self-cultivation. In this way, young Vietnamese consumers reject the communist identity and lifestyles promoted by the government. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Everyday consumption practices; Qualitative approach; Self-identity; Vietnam; Young consumer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030782318

GVC's are difficult to measure due to interlinked cross border relations of goods, services, labour and capital at the level of the individual enterprise. A focal point in GVCs is the relationship between enterprises and currently only few statistics measure directly linkages between enterprises (e.g. FATS statistics) and new types of statistical evidence needs to be developed by linking different data sources at enterprise level. Measuring GVCs consists of a number of conceptual and methodological aspects which need to be combined in an analytical framework. Pieces of the puzzle exist or are being developed already today, e.g. the Trade in Value Added (TiVA) concept, Trade by Enterprise Statistics (TEC), or Foreign Affiliates Statistics (FATS) which constitute elements of a measurement framework under elaboration but other elements are still missing, such as information on business functions, governance structures and network relations. This paper presents results of recent initiatives in business statistics within the European Statistical System addressing different aspects of GVCs by different approaches; partly by launching a new survey on international organisation and sourcing of business functions, and partly by linking existing statistical registers at enterprise level. Finally, the paper identifies new activities to be launched by the statistical community in order to improve the measurement of GVCs. © 2017 CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives et d'Informations Internationales), a center for research and expertise on the world economy","Business functions; Global value chains; International sourcing; Micro data linking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020684499

The results reveal that resource possession, resource picking, and resource utilization are three important strategic dimensions for realizing synergy and creating value in CBAs. Furthermore, mediation analysis shows that the two acquisition-based dynamic capabilities—value identification and resource reconfiguration—act as important mediators in how the joining firms’ resource base impacts acquisition outcomes. The results shed light on the mechanisms through which the constructs influence value creation in CBAs and highlight the procedural and dynamic character of these determinants. The results also indicate that an integrative and process perspective, such as the “input-process-output” model proposed in this study, is an important step forward in merger and acquisition (M&A) research.

This article focuses-with the help of a survey of 136 research units worldwide supplemented by a number of case-studies-on the factors that influence the extent to which local mobilization efforts succeed. The research shows that universities provide the most fertile grounds for such research units, and that external support and support from the leadership of the university are important factors behind their establishment. In the longer term, however, attracting core (basic) finance is essential for the unit's ability to maintain cognitive control of its research program.

This paper explores the rationales for national innovation policies, as laid out in the existing literature on the subject, and considers what the lessons and challenges for theory and practice in this area are. Innovation policy attempts to influence innovation activity, often with the purpose of increasing economic growth. But it can also have more specific aims such as preventing unwarranted climate change, improving national health, and so on. The increasing attention given to innovation policy at the national level from the 1990s onwards went hand in hand with the development of a new, systemic understanding of innovation, which in a better way than before accounted for the 'stylised facts' of innovation activity as identified by empirical work. The system approach, as the paper shows, came to have a significant influence on the subsequent policy discourse. Drawing on recent advances in innovation-systems theory, a synthetic framework for the analysis of innovation policy is developed and used to highlight issues of particular relevance for the conduct of innovation policy and future scholarly work in this area. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Grand challenges; Innovation; Innovation policy; National innovation systems",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075412889

Firms do not always exploit the potential of the RSC, and the conditions allowing the exploitation remain unclear. This paper explores the alignment between the RSC and the competitive strategy of the firm. Results from seven case studies, focusing on original equipment manufacturers, show how the RSC can play a strategic, tactical or operational role for the firm.

The aim was to achieve improved technology direction and alignment across the business by implementing and evolving roadmapping at Grundfos as part of the existing technology planning process. Key elements include the successful adaptation and implementation of the standard T-Plan process for product-technology roadmapping, and the importance of ownership and transfer of the process facilitation to people within the different areas of the organisation. Additional significant insights are the need for iteration in developing a customised approach, and the context specific learning about building on existing processes, data collection and familiar representations. To customise the selected approach the company chose an exploratory development process. The initiative was led by a technology manager who drew upon roadmapping experience in other companies within an industrial-academic consortium as well as taking advice from external facilitators. The technology manager secured support from peers across the organisation who were then trained as internal facilitators. Together they created their own roadmapping process and templates drawing upon established materials and activities related to technology planning within the company. They iteratively developed the process between each workshop in the first application and evolved the process year on year and have adopted a Roadmapping Roadmapping (R2) review template to plan future steps. The resources needed and lessons learned from this exploratory development process are also outlined. Links are made between the practical experience and the related literature on the integration of tools, the use of boundary objects and the need for flexibility and persistence in use, which extend the discussion to include wider organisational dimensions and to give further insights into how to successfully embed roadmapping. This highlights, for example, the related issues of timing and ownership, as the organisational circumstances need to be favourable for a change in process, as well as the importance of working across organisational boundaries, integration within the organisation's processes and achieving alignment of diverse perspectives and co-ordination structures. In summary, the paper's contribution is to provide insights into the evolution of customised roadmapping as a mechanism to improve alignment in technology planning across a business. The experience underlines the importance of ownership, transfer of roadmapping skills and iteration of the process in embedding roadmapping within the business. In addition, it highlights the significance of context, as even a customised approach will need to evolve to best fit the aims of the organisation and its environment. © 2018 Towards Sustainable Technologies and Innovation - Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference of the International Association for Management of Technology, IAMOT 2018.

However, little attention has been paid to such Chinese expatriate managers and their leadership challenges in an inter-cultural context, especially across a large cultural distance. To fill the gap in the literature concerning the leadership challenges for expatriate managers in an inter-cultural context, the purpose of this paper is to elucidate the leadership styles of Chinese expatriate managers from the perspectives of three traditional Chinese philosophies (i.e. Confucianism, Taoism, and Legalism) in the inter-cultural context of the Netherlands. Design/methodology/approach: The data for this qualitative study were collected via semi-structured, open-ended, narrative interviews with 30 Chinese expatriate managers in the Netherlands. Findings: The results clearly show that the leadership style of Chinese expatriate managers is deeply rooted in the three traditional Chinese philosophies of Confucianism, Taoism, and Legalism, even in an inter-cultural context. Specifically, the study reveals two salient aspects of how Chinese expatriate managers frame and interact with a foreign cultural context from the perspectives of traditional Chinese philosophies. First, the Chinese expatriate managers reported an initial cultural shock related to frictions between the foreign cultural context and Confucianism or Taoism, but less so in the case of Legalism. Second, the Chinese expatriate managers also reported that their interactions with the Dutch culture are best described as a balance between partial conflict and partial complementarity (thus, a duality). In this sense, the leadership style of Chinese expatriate managers is influenced jointly by the three traditional Chinese philosophies and certain elements of the foreign cultural context. This is consistent with the Chinese perspective of yin-yang balancing. Originality/value: This study is among the first to offer a more nuanced and highly contextualized understanding of leadership in the unique case of expatriate managers from an emerging market (e.g. China) in an advanced economy (e.g. the Netherlands). The authors call for more research to apply the unique perspective of yin-yang balancing in an inter-cultural context. The authors posit that this approach represents the most salient implication of this study.

Design/methodology/approach: The author first explain why Peter P. Li’s “asymmetry” and “superiority” arguments are flawed by referring to the original text of the classical book of Zhong-Yong (中庸) and a comparison between Zhong-Yong and Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean. The author then propose an alternative approach to Zhong-Yong balancing that is embedded in the original text Zhong-Yong but somehow has been neglected by many Chinese scholars. The author concludes the commentary by unifying the two alternative approaches to Zhong-Yong balancing under the inclusion-selection-promotion-transition (ISPT) framework of Zhong-Yong balancing. Findings: There are three main findings. First, as the original text of Zhong-Yong does not prescribe asymmetry, Peter P. Li’s notion of “Yin-Yang balancing” is ironically unbalanced or anti-Zhong-Yong due to his emphasis on asymmetry to the exclusion of symmetry. Second, due to the equivalency between Zhong-Yong and Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean, Peter P. Li’s assertion that “Yin-Yang balancing” is superior as a solution to paradox management is flawed. Third, his “Yin-Yang balancing” solution is only (the less sophisticated) one of two alternative approaches to Zhong-Yong balancing, i.e., ratio-based combination of Yin-Yang opposites. What Peter P. Li and many other Chinese have neglected is another approach to Zhong-Yong that is embedded in the original text of Zhong-Yong, which I call “analysis plus synthesis.” Research limitations/implications: As it is a commentary there are no specific limitations except for what can be covered in the space available. Practical implications: The “analysis plus synthesis” approach to Zhong-Yong can be adopted by practitioners who are demanded to balance between opposite forces in daily life and work. Social implications: The rejection of the “Yin-Yang balancing being superior” assertion facilitates reduction of friction and non-cooperation between intellectual traditions. Originality/value: This commentary contributes to the “West meets East” discourse by debunking Peter P. Li’s assertion that Yin-Yang balancing is superior as a solution to paradox management and his prescription that balancing between Yin-Yang opposites must be asymmetric. It also contributes to the Chinese indigenous management research by identifying a largely neglected approach to Zhong-Yong balancing (i.e. “analysis plus synthesis”) that is alternative to the commonly understood ratio-based combination approach (e.g. “Yin-Yang balancing”). In addition, it contributes to the management literature by proposing the ISPT framework of Zhong-Yong balancing. © 2018, Xin Li.","Asymmetry; Balancing; Doctrine of the mean; Symmetry; Yin-Yang; Zhong-Yong",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033479919

Second, based on data from the mandatory joint audit abolition year and the following two years, we test the audit quality differences using abnormal accruals. Most CFOs perceive that audit quality by a single big four audit firm is the same as it is in joint audits with either one or two big four audit firms.

Nordic tourism destinations have also experienced changes, such as changing precipitation patterns, lack of snow in winter and shifts in seasons.

We reviewed national climate strategies of the Nordic countries from the perspectives of tourism, but excluding the transport sector. We also reviewed Nordic national tourism strategies from the perspective of climate change, particularly the extent to which they address climate adaptation. We found out that the national climate strategies do not pay enough attention to tourism adaptation needs, nor do the national tourism strategies present adaptation actions that tourism actors could consider. To connect these national-level strategies, there is a need to review adaptation actions for tourism within the national adaptation framework supported by research based evidence.

The management strategies included different pretreatment methods of SSOHW prior to anaerobic digestion and different biogas applications. Biopulp technology, screw press, and disc screen were chosen as three available pretreatment methods and electricity production, combined heat and power (CHP) production, as well as biogas upgrading were selected as three downstream management strategies. In all scenarios, the produced digestate was assumed for nutrient recovery and reject fractions from pretreatment step were considered to be incinerated. A consequential LCA was employed and long term marginal data was adapted to credit the amount of recovered energy and nutrient. The composition of SSOHW collected in Denmark was used to investigate the impact of created scenarios on several damage categories, i.e., Global warming potential, Human health, Ecosystem quality, and Resources. Moreover, the scenarios were also compared in terms of energy ratio to find the strategy resulting in the highest energy payback. The results showed that scenarios developed under the biopulp technology outperformed their counterparts in which other pretreatment methods were used. This was mostly due to the higher energy and nutrient recovery caused by correct sorting of SSOHW into reject and substrate fractions. Moreover, based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that CHP production would be the best downstream management option while the results were so sensitive to the source of substituted energy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas valorisation; LCA; Organic waste management","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Global warming; Heating; Life cycle; Nutrients; Recovery; Combined heat and power production; Electricity production; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management strategies; Organic household wastes; Source-sorted organic fraction; Valorisation; Waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042132892

Research on this green lean research stream is therefore limited, especially when compared to the vast amount of scholarly research focused on the ‘traditional’ VSM tool. To complement and support the narrow body of knowledge on the application of VSM as tools to improve environmental performance and enhance the effectiveness of its application, this paper proposes an approach, based on the Deming's Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) improvement cycle, to systematically implement and conduct Environmental-VSM (E-VSM) studies. The implementation of the proposed method is reported through an action research-based case study conducted in a helical rolling process of one of the mining consumables business units of an international diversified mining and materials multinational company. The results of the case study indicate that the proposed PDCA-based approach to E-VSM can be an effective alternative to improve the green performance of operations. Besides the proposal of this approach, its testing, and expanding the body of knowledge in the green lean field, the paper also contributes by providing a guiding reference for operations managers who may want to make the operations of their organisations more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Finally, this paper also intends to contribute by inspiring researchers and practitioners to broaden the study of the under-researched field which explores the application of VSM for environmental sustainability enhancement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental Value Stream Mapping; Green lean; Green wastes; Value stream mapping; VSM","Environmental impact; Environmental management; Mapping; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Environmental values; Green lean; Green wastes; Multi-national companies; Operations managers; Value stream mapping; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042126249

This chapter presents an analysis of the data from a case study of such a platform, the World Bank's online game Urgent Evoke, which has been designed with the purpose of engaging citizens in developing innovative solutions for sociopolitical problems like poverty. The analysis is based on Nonaka's concept of Ba, which means ""place"" and is described as a platform for advancing the creation of knowledge. The analysis suggests that, in order to create a digital Ba, the design should not only facilitate the four characteristics of Ba that Nonaka has described -socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization. The design should also allow multiple forms of participation, as well as recognise external stakeholders' contributions to the process of knowledge creation and innovation. © 2018, IGI Global.

Methods: Eighty-six academies were invited to complete an online survey based on three themes related to hip/groin injury: (1) prevention, (2) screening and (3) return-to-play (RTP). Results: Sixty-four (74%) academies responded, of which fifty-two (81%) regularly conducted hip/groin injury prevention exercises, most commonly core/abdominal related, while only half of academies used high-load eccentric exercises. Fifty-three (83%) utilised screening measures for hip/groin injury, with adductor-strength testing commonly used in 40 (77%) academies, whilst patient-reported outcome measures were used infrequently (6%). Fifty (78%) academies followed a specific RTP protocol, often linked to player baseline scores, with adductor-strength deficits and pain on RTP tests commonly noted indicators of readiness to RTP. Conclusion: Most, but not all responding academies, address prevention, screening and RTP in their management of hip/groin injury. Many preventative exercises are utilised, with core/abdominal related exercises being the most common. Screening for baseline scores, in particular assessing adductor strength, is often used for gauging RTP post-injury. Most management methods described by academies link to current evidence-based literature; yet many elements of practice could be improved/standardised in the academy youth football level in the future. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","academy; Football; groin; hip; prevention; screening",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066838969

Methods: Fourteen Italian elite male senior football players were monitored during four training sessions incorporating SSG, and six FG, during the pre-season. Baseline measurements included, countermovement jump (CMJ), 5-m sprint time and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test level 1 distance (YYIR1). Activity pattern was collected via 15-Hz global positioning system with 100-Hz accelerometer integrated. Results: Maximum accelerations (Accmax) and maximum decelerations (Decmax) showed moderate correlations (P &lt; 0.05; r = 0.49 and 0.52) between SSG and FG. YYIR1 correlated with total distance covered (TD) in both SSG and FG (P &lt; 0.05; r = 0.42 to 0.57) and with high-intensity distance (HIR) during FG (P &lt; 0.05; r = 0.46 ± 0.38). CMJ showed positive correlations with TD, Accmax, Decmax, total accelerations (Acctot) and total decelerations (Dectot) during FG (P &lt; 0.05; r = 0.40 ± 0.38, 0.41 ± 0.40, 0.46 ± 0.38, 0.65 ± 0.29, 0.57 ± 0.33). Multiple regression analysis revealed Decmax during SSG, as significant predictor of physical performance during FG, explaining a significant amount of variation in HIR, very-high speed running, Accmax and Decmax (P &lt; 0.05; R2 = 0.49, 0.44, 0.26 and 0.49) during FG. Conclusions: SSG seems more effective to enhance muscular efforts occurring during FG, such as accelerations and decelerations, rather than speed patterns. Specifically, Decmax distance imposed during SSG was identified as the predictor of players’ movement patterns during FG. Thus, importance of eccentric strength (i.e. imposed when decelerating) to achieve football-specific fitness is emphasised. These findings may assist coaches and any football practitioners for pre-season programming. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","acceleration; fitness; global positioning systems; performance; team sports; training load",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066828243

In the early market stage, demand side cannibalisation from e-books is potentially underestimated due to two effects: (1) early adopter profiles and (2) different usage context situations for digital and physical products. In two empirical studies, we investigate cannibalisation effects as well as drivers of the cannibalisation potential between e-books and p-books related to consumer needs in different usage situations. We focus on the (early-stage) German e-book market and analyse cannibalisation effects and sources of cannibalisation potential between e-books and p-books in two studies. We do not find empirical support for a cannibalisation of p-book demand in the early market stage of e-books in Germany, even after controlling for potential biases related to early adopter profiles. However, our results indicate a significant cannibalisation potential between e-books and p-books that relates to different consumer needs in different usage situations. Our findings imply that research on cannibalisation effects could substantially benefit from analysing substitution patterns between digital media products and their physical counterparts in early market stages. By this, cannibalisation drivers can be revealed early enough, so that managers can react accordingly.

Using a unique panel data set that contains detailed information about BDA solutions owned by 814 companies during the time frame from 2008 to 2014, on the one hand, and their financial performance, on the other hand, we estimate the relationship between BDA assets and firm productivity and find that live BDA assets are associated with an average of 3–7 percent improvement in firm productivity. Yet we also find substantial differences in returns from BDA when we consider the industry in which a firm operates. While firms in information technology-intensive or highly competitive industries are clearly able to extract value from BDA assets, we did not detect measurable productivity improvement for firms outside these industry groups. Taken together, our findings provide robust empirical evidence for the business value of BDA, but also highlight important boundary conditions.

However, we know little about how motivated decision-makers prioritize goals when facing multiple pieces of contradictory performance data that reflect the competing goals of public services. Such goal conflict is an inherent aspect of public management. To understand its implications for the use of performance data, we develop a theory of goal reprioritization. We start by assuming that elected officials have preferences between specific policy goals, and about governance processes-such as a preference for public or private service provision. When elected officials face contradictory pieces of performance data, governance preferences drive performance evaluations to the point that they are willing to reweight their goal preferences to minimize cognitive dissonance. We offer experimental evidence of this process, showing that elected officials asked to evaluate school performance reprioritize between two distinct policy goals for schools-test scores and student well-being-to fit with their governance preferences. Reprioritization is an attractive strategy since it allows elected officials to claim they are using performance data, even as underlying governance preferences lead them to set aside the evaluative goal-based criteria by which they would otherwise make performance evaluations. In other words, preferences concerning the nature of government can trump goal preferences when decision-makers use performance data. © The Author(s) 2018.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050806049

Much less scholarly attention is devoted to the influence of the bureaucracy on the content and composition of the policy agenda at the front end of the process. Agenda setting is a fundamental aspect of politics, and this article examines the influence of the bureaucracy on the policy agenda and the conditions for this influence. The core proposition is that the policy agenda is larger and more diverse in political systems in which administrative professionals take up a larger share of the bureaucracy. This effect is expected to be mitigated by the involvement of elected representatives in the policymaking process. The empirical analysis supports these expectations.

An increase in transparency through the staggered signing of bilateral tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) between home countries and tax havens is associated with a 2.5% increase in the value of affected firms. The results are stronger for firms with more complex tax haven structures and weakly governed firms. Furthermore, firms that respond to TIEAs by haven hopping (i.e., they move subsidiaries from affected to nonaffected tax havens) do not experience an increase in firm value.

Moreover, while scales are viewed as central to the diagnosis of the organizational challenges posed by climate change and sustainability, the role of scaling in meeting these challenges has not yet been recognized. By analysing two ethnographic case studies, conducted at Samsø Energy Academy and Farendløse Cider Works, respectively, the authors identify scaling as a core activity of the sustainability organization. The two organizations studied each situate their operations at the heart of the climate change problematic – one in organic farming, the other in renewable energy – and, employing what the authors term ‘the method of scaling’, they impose order on the world in which they operate. The method of scaling helps the organizations relate their actions to the ambiguous concepts of sustainability and climate change. The authors find that the two organizations’ scaling activities occur in three modes: rejection, innovation and conscious adoption of core concepts such as sustainability and climate change. These modes of scaling help organizations turn something as immense as the climate into a small and manageable problem, thus making abstract concepts part of concrete, organizational practice. © 2018 British Academy of Management",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045441621

Appropriating a Habermasian ethical and discursive lens, we examine and disentangle three particular challenges emerging from the EAOD process: lack of accountability and potential opportunism; equal participation and resolution of actor-related tensions; and organisational participation and internalisation of dissent. We show that EAOD can initiate plural dialogue that helps co-construct and balance different voices within an informal and noninstitutionalised context for interaction and public deliberation.

In this study, the GI-based urban water management practices of five cities famous for their progressive approach to water management were investigated. Based on reviews of open-source city plans and strategies, supplemented with information obtained directly from city managers, the purpose was to share best practices for the transition to sustainable urban water management and to gain insight into the role, if any, of GI in urban water management. An analytical frame based on transition theory was adopted. All five cities represented states of transition at the near end of a sustainable urban water management scale. Despite some overlap in challenges concerning water supply, environmental protection, and flood risk management, the development target of each city was unique, as were their solutions. GI has been applied as a way to reduce water footprints in Singapore and Berlin, to protect the environment in Philadelphia, and to help save potable water for consumption in Melbourne and Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city. Despite differences in scale, GI was, in all cases, applied as a supplement to the conventional water infrastructure. All five cities reveal a strong top-down approach towards sustainable urban water management and a strong mindset on GI's role for future development. However, all five cities point to similar challenges for GI implementation, including space and cost constrains as well as barriers for inter-sectorial and stakeholder collaboration, which limit the speed of city-wide upscaling of GI solutions and full realization of GI benefits. The study indicates a need for a simultaneous change in the cognitive, normative, and regulative conditions of the urban water management regime for sustainability transition. Such a change requires a better balance between top-down and bottom-up planning to overcome barriers and foster innovation. The five cities jointly contribute to a noteworthy list of green solutions, city-wide strategies and guidelines, pilot project programs, regulations, and incentive programs, which may serve as inspiration for other cities’ transition plans. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Green infrastructure; Sponge city; Sustainability transition; Sustainable urban water management","environmental protection; infrastructure planning; management practice; sustainability; urban planning; water management; water supply; Australia; Berlin; Germany; Melbourne; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; United States; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044667462

Before 2008, the European Central Bank used shadow banking to create a single safe asset that we term shadow money, and in doing so also erased borders between Euro area government bond markets. Lacking appropriate ECB support, shadow euros could not withstand the pressures of the global financial crisis and brought down several periphery euro government bonds with them. Two new plans, the Capital Markets Union and the Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities, again turn to shadow banking, this time by using securitization to generate an entirely private safe asset or a public–private safe asset. Such plans cannot solve the enduring predicament of EMU’s bond markets architecture: that Member States have competed for investors (liquidity) since the introduction of the euro, betraying a deep hostility towards collective political solutions to the single safe asset problem. Technocratic-led, market-based initiatives need to persuade EMU states that there is little threat to their ability to issue debt in liquid markets.

The four case studies point to excessive reliance on group discussion, a need for more trial and error and that field tests and prototypes generate new learnings that save time and lowers subsequent risks. Technical knowledge creation in nascent high-tech industries requires opportunities to work with and further develop knowledge in its tacit form.

In our earlier work [Physics Procedia, 83:211–217, 2016], we showed that when the laser surface modification process was carried out in water instead of air, the obtained surface characteristics were remarkably different, which led to a significant improvement in the metal deposition characteristics using electroless plating. In this work, we try to explain the underlying fundamental mechanisms that contribute to this improvement in surface characteristics through concurrent experimental and modeling research. The observed images of laser modified surfaces suggest that a hemispherical hump is formed in the case of water at lower laser fluences that breakup with an increase in fluence. Such a behavior was not observed when the process was carried out in air. We explain this phenomenon by simulating the temperature profiles in the polymer during the laser heating process in air and water. The results suggest that subsurface heating effects occur when the process is carried out in water. We further argue that this phenomenon is mainly responsible for the formation of the complex structure that was observed in our previous work. © 2018 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Finite difference method; Laser; Polymers; Subsurface heating; Surface modification","Electroless plating; Finite difference method; Lasers; Polymers; Complex structure; Fundamental mechanisms; Laser surface modification; Metal deposition; Modified surfaces; Polymer surfaces; Surface characteristics; Temperature profiles; Surface treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044140609

Insights gathered from an ethnographic investigation carried out at metaLAB - an academic laboratory located at Harvard University (Cambridge, MA, USA) - build the empirical foundation. Findings show that various forms of arts and design (including poetry, photography, art installations, motion graphics videos, data visualization) play an important role in connecting metaLAB to external stakeholders and in activating multiple value drivers. The adoption of arts- and design-based initiatives allows the translation of different needs and wants of stakeholders into shared meanings, but also supports emotional and cognitive engagement and creative and divergent viewpoints.

Building on mechanisms from information economics and signaling theory, we postulate that secrecy is more important for protecting knowledge for firms that have legal requirements to reveal information to shareholders. Furthermore, we argue that this effect is contingent on the location in a technological cluster, on a firm's investment in fixed assets and on a firm's past innovation performance. We test our hypotheses using a representative sample of 683 firms in Germany between 2005 and 2013. Our results support the moderation effect of a technological cluster and a firm's investment in fixed assets.

In order to fill this gap, this paper analyzes the impact of external and internal environmental orientation on start-ups’ network characteristics, because networks are both vital for the success of start-ups and resource demanding. More specifically, the effects of environmental orientation on networking frequency and network size among start-ups are analyzed. Empirical data from 248 technology-based start-ups shows that those firms with a strong external environmental orientation have significantly higher networking frequencies and build larger networks. Conversely, a strong internal environmental orientation is linked to smaller networks. Thus, the results highlight the relevance of differentiating between the external and internal environmental orientation of start-ups because both concepts can have very different effects. From a practitioner perspective, the results have important implications with regard to the resources required for networking and the opportunities and barriers that tend to accompany internal and external environmental orientations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Business network; Ecopreneurship; Entrepreneurship; Environmental orientation; Start-up; Sustainability","Environmental technology; Reactor startup; Business networks; Different effects; Ecopreneurship; Empirical data; Entrepreneurship; Larger networks; Network characteristics; Technology-based; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041478131

Using socioanalytic theory, we further suggested that fearless dominance (i.e., an egotistical personal style characterized by self-promotion and prioritization of one’s own needs before those of others) would be negatively associated with interpersonal performance (i.e., high CWB-I and low CP) only when individuals indicated low levels of interpersonal influence (i.e., a dimension of political skill reflecting an ability to adapt one’s behavior in subtle, sophisticated, and situationally effective ways).

However, there is little understanding of the mechanisms through which ABIs produce learning outcomes of value to organizations. This theoretical paper addresses this concern by revisiting the philosophy of art and education in light of developments in neuroscience known as embodied cognition. Specifically, we examine the role played by simulations in behavioral change and the way in which ABIs can foster the creation of simulations. This leads to two propositions, a) representing a phenomenon through new simulations can create new possibilities for interacting with this phenomenon; and b) making art is a means by which managers can construct new simulations. The significance of these propositions is illustrated by re-interpreting three accounts of art-based interventions found in the literature. These propositions have important implications for the planning, implementation, and evaluation of ABIs in management education. In particular, they emphasize the need to match art medium with desired outcomes, provide support for the view that ABIs are well suited to learning about complex managerial challenges, and question the effectiveness of verbal reflection as part of ABIs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Arts-based interventions; Embodied cognition; Managerial learning interventions; Perceptual symbol system theory; Theory of knowledge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031795103

Throughout this development, technologies and technological relationships were governed with different and shifting degrees of formality. Simultaneously, firms differentiated technology accessibility across actors and technologies to benefit from openness and appropriation of innovation. Our analysis shows that the discussion of competitiveness and appropriability needs to be expanded from the focal appropriability regime and complementary assets to the larger context of the innovation ecosystem and its cooperative and competitive actor relations, with dispersed complementary and substitute assets and technologies.

This study investigates how a network of stakeholders collaborating to manage innovation openly co-creates value over time; it contributes to the existing literature on value co-creation by taking the perspective of the network as a whole. The study follows a case in which value co-creation unfolds over time across a network of stakeholders within the business-to-business facility service context. The in-depth longitudinal investigation of a network composed of a corporate customer and its external facility service providers revealed that a network of stakeholders co-creates value over time by (i) offering an adaptable structure for the network to organize innovation activities and establish support routines, (ii) facilitating interactions to support stakeholder relation development and (iii) allowing participants to achieve self-empowerment. Therefore, stakeholder value co-creation entails the combination of single value co-creation activities and overarching network progressions that allow for learning and inter-organizational trust among stakeholders. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","facility services; interaction; process studies; Stakeholder value co-creation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028360966

Within the last two decades or so, kosher and halal markets have become global in scope and states, manufacturers, restaurants, shops, certifiers and consumers around the world are faced with ever stricter and more complex requirements - most clearly exemplified by Muslim and Jewish groups' call for kosher and halal certification by third party certification bodies. During this period hundreds of kosher and halal certifiers have emerged around the world, and while thousands of manufacturers, restaurants and shops have been certified, the majority have not. Kosher and halal requirements are comparable, but there are also many differences and the book discusses how these similarities and differences affect production, trade and regulation around the world. The authors research demonstrates that there is a need to address kosher and halal markets simultaneously and answers the question ""what characterizes global kosher and halal markets and how can businesses comply with the rising demands and requirements that have emerged?"" This is the only book of its kind and it will appeal to manufacturing companies, restaurants and shops that already are or want to be kosher/halal certified. The book can also be assigned in a variety of upper-level undergraduate courses and graduate seminars in business studies, management and marketing. Moreover, the book will be of interest to readers in the natural sciences (for example, food scientists) and outside academia, that is, to state as well as non-state kosher/halal certification bodies, policy makers, interest groups and consultants.

A quantitative model is proposed, which evaluates the discounted value of capital and operating costs of changeable manufacturing design concepts, based on essential characteristics regarding their type and extent of changeability. Design/methodology/approach: Quantitative empirical modeling is applied, where model conceptualization, validation, and implementation are central elements, using two Danish manufacturing companies as cases. Findings: The applicability of the model is demonstrated in the two case companies, highlighting differences in type, extent, and level of feasible changeability, as a result of differences in product and production characteristics. Research limitations/implications: Further studies of changeability implementation should be conducted across industrial fields in order to generalize findings. Practical implications: There is currently limited support for the conceptual design phase of changeable and reconfigurable manufacturing, where critical decisions regarding type, extent, and level of changeability must be made, regardless of high degrees of uncertainty about future demand scenarios. Originality/value: This paper expands previous research on design for changeability and reconfigurability, by explicitly considering changeability as a capability that can be enabled in various ways for various purposes in different industrial contexts.

For this purpose, the analytical constructs of the Fictive Student and the Fictive Entrepreneur are developed. Design/methodology/approach: Through analysis of 86 course descriptions from 81 universities in 21 countries, this study examines the degree to which course descriptions use gendered language, how such language constructs gendered subjects, and the resultant implications. Findings: This paper finds that course descriptions are predominantly, but not exclusively, masculine in their language. More importantly, the distribution of feminine and masculine language is uneven across course descriptions. Context variables such as regional or national culture differences do not explain this distribution. Instead, the phenomenon is explained by course content/type; whereby practice-based entrepreneurship courses are highly masculine, compared to traditional academic courses, where students learn about entrepreneurship as a social phenomenon. Practical implications: Universities and educators have not taken into account recent research about the real and possible negative consequences of positioning entrepreneurship in a stereotypical, masculinized fashion. This may offer an inexpensive opportunity to improve recruitment and description accuracy. Originality/value: The paper’s contribution is fourfold. First, it contributes to debates on the gendering of entrepreneurship by extending these into EEd. Second, it extends Sarasvathy’s (2004) concern with barriers to, rather than incentives for, entrepreneurship to include EEd. Third, it contributes to the emerging literature on entrepreneurship as practice, by highlighting the masculization of EEd, as it gets closer to practice and the role of language in this. Finally, it highlights the gendered implications of English medium courses. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Course description; Course type; Entrepreneurship education; Gender; Higher education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037996459

The first mesh products were cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002. In contrast to stringent requirements for the development of pharmaceuticals, there was never a systematic scientific evaluation of mesh products. Purpose: We examined whether Swedish gynecological surgeons have transformed increasing amounts of scientific information into common learning, resulting in a convergent and consistent pattern of mesh use. Methods: Based on data from the Swedish National Quality Register of Gynecological Surgery, registered from 2010 to 2016, we examined changes in decisions to use mesh in a largely uniform group of 2864 recurrence patients operated by 455 surgeons, where surgical mesh was used in 1435 patients (50.1%). By means of logistic regression, we explained decisions to use mesh by clinical risk factors, an FDA warning, year of surgery, type of hospital, and geographical factors. Results: The use of mesh in Sweden varied extensively, by a range from 7% to 93% on county level. These disparities were maintained between the entities over time. Different groups of decision makers had drawn different conclusions from the available information. Geography was the most important parameter in explaining decisions to use mesh. Conclusion: Mounting scientific information has had no measurable impact on decision-making, and has not led to a more consistent decision pattern. Early decisions have led to obvious ‘communities of practice’ at county and region levels. Swedish surgeons, unaltered through 7 years, have made mesh decisions in a clearly biased fashion, highly influenced by geographical factors, and with no measurable change towards national consensus. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","decision-making; health care; quality assurance",,Article in Press,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044358421

The purpose of this paper is to identify how the RSC can contribute to the firm’s financial performance and examine the exogenous contingency factors decisive for the contribution’s size. Because the exogenous factors are outside the control of the firm’s operations and supply chain management, the factors influence the RSC’s financial contribution irrespective of managerial policies and design decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies a systematic literature review using the sequence of planning the review, searching and screening literature, extracting information from the selected literature, and synthesizing and analyzing findings. In total, 112 papers were included. Findings: The study has identified 15 distinct opportunities for RSC-contribution to the firm’s financial performance. The study has identified 56 contingency factors. These are related to market segmentation, customer behavior, product design, and the firm’s distributor network. The study includes an interrelationship network between factors and the RSC’s contribution. Practical implications: For managers, the paper shows how the RSC can increase the firm’s financial performance and which contingency factors determine whether operating a RSC will be financially viable if implemented. Originality/value: While extant literature includes several reviews about RSC-related managerial policies and design decisions, this paper contains the very first collection of RSC-contribution opportunities available to manufacturers as well as the first review of exogenous contingency factors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Product recovery; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chain; Systematic literature Review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043462536

Nor does the OECD disaggregate EU supports to individual member countries. This chapter provides a new set of a complete estimates of support to EU wine pro ducers. It also reveals how unevenly those supports are spread across EU member countries.

Our econometric model reveals that the inverted U-shaped relationships found by Laursen and Salter (2006) for external search breadth hold for all functional areas but those for external search depth hold only for R&D-based search aim ing at product innovation. In every case, we find that observed firms' breadth suboptimal. We also find suboptimality for search depth: The optimal depth level is the maximum for marketing-based and manufacturing-based searches. We also specifically show that marketing is the dominant base for external sourcing for product innovation, and manufacturing is the dominant base for external sourcing for process innovation. Finally, we find strong complementarities among the roles of the three functional areas, which suggests that firms develop different absorp tive capacities at the same time and do not substitute one for another. © 2018 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

By the use of two survey experiments in very different political contexts—Texas and Denmark—and a difference-in-differences analysis exploiting a reform of the political governance of public schools in Denmark, we find that public managers respond to political pressure. We find no indications that they emulate institutionalized models or learn from performance information from other organizations when they adopt organizational innovations.

Empirically, we show how diversity as Lacanian lack is understood as nothing in or of itself, but as an empty signifier with no signified. The lack of diversity becomes a catalyst for desiring particular ideas of diversity that, however, constantly change due to the empty form of diversity. Anxiety manifests itself in the obsession of unobtainable idealised forms of diversity as well as in the uncertainty associated with the traumatic experience of always falling short of what is desired in an object–the experience of failed diversity. Conclusively, we discuss the productive potential of the power of lack. The impossibility of diversity is what, at once, conditions the possibility of diversity.

Designing effective air pollution management policies requires knowledge of the sources and health risks of PM10/PM2.5-bound PAHs. This study investigates the comparative differences of meteorological influences on PM10/PM2.5-bound PAHs distributions, as well as their potential sources and health risks. The aim of this study is to provide a science-based rationale for particle-bound PAHs pollution control. Both PM10 and PM2.5 samples were collected in the center of Beijing, China in winter and summer from 2013 to 2015. The meteorological conditions were monitored simultaneously. An analysis of the correlation between meteorological variables and PAHs concentrations indicates that average temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation had the most significant influences on the PAHs concentrations. A Principal component analysis combined with a diagnostic ratio tool is applied to the source apportionment of particle-bound PAHs, which indicates that diesel, gasoline, and coal combustion contribute most to PAHs pollution. The high emissions of the PM10/PM2.5-bound PAHs result in a 3.72 × 10−3/3.31 × 10−3 and 5.79 × 10−5/4.39 × 10−5 excess lung cancer risk in winter and summer, respectively. PM2.5 contains more PAHs than the coarser fraction (PM2.5-10), and accounts for 89% (winter) and 76% (summer) of the health risk caused by PM10. Given the higher risks caused by PM2.5 than the PM2.5-10 portion, PM2.5 should be treated as the prioritized-control pollutant. Moreover, actively reducing the combustion of fossil fuels and a strategy of changing residents’ exposure characteristics are proposed for the mitigation of particle-bound PAHs pollution and control of health risks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Health risk; Particle pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Source apportionment","Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Coal combustion; Data handling; Fossil fuels; Health; Health risks; Hydrocarbons; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Pollution control; Principal component analysis; Exposure characteristics; Meteorological condition; Meteorological influence; Meteorological variables; Particle pollution; Pollution management; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Source apportionment; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041115578

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Five currently used methods to account for the global warming (GW) impact of the induced land-use change (LUC) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been applied to four biofuel case studies. Two of the investigated methods attempt to avoid the need of considering a definite occupation –thus amortization– period by considering ongoing LUC trends as a dynamic baseline. This leads to the accounting of a small fraction (0.8%) of the related emissions from the assessed LUC, thus their validity is disputed. The comparison of methods and contrasting case studies illustrated the need of clearly distinguishing between the different time horizons involved in life cycle assessments (LCA) of land-demanding products like biofuels. Absent in ISO standards, and giving rise to several confusions, definitions for the following time horizons have been proposed: technological scope, inventory model, impact characterization, amortization/occupation, plantation lifetime and harvesting frequency. It is suggested that the anticipated technical lifetime of biorefineries using energy crops as feedstock stands as the best proxy for the cut-off criterion of land's occupation period and the inventory modeling period. Top-down LUC models are suggested as a gross reference benchmark to evaluate LUC results from bottom-up models, since the former represent average GHG emissions from deforestation statistics at different spatial resolutions. Reporting LUC emissions per area and implementing a corporate accounting system that ascribes deforestation emissions to responsible companies could avoid the critical uncertainty related to yield estimations. © 2017",,"Crops; Deforestation; Depreciation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Accounting methods; Accounting system; Comparison of methods; Inventory modeling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reference benchmarks; Spatial resolution; Yield estimation; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041105766

This article presents six case studies from major firms experimenting with Agile–Stage-Gate hybrids. These results show that early outcomes of these efforts are quite positive; some firms report significant improvements in both time to market and development productivity, as well as faster responses to changing market conditions and customer needs and higher project team morale. However, they also identified many challenges in implementing Agile–Stage-Gate hybrids, including addressing management skepticism, finding the needed resources to field dedicated teams, and dealing with fluid product definitions and development plans.

In the construction industry, the implementation of modularity has been limited to off-site production (OSP). The construction design process incorporates a substantial number of disciplines and stakeholders. Moreover, in the application OSP, the design phase is critical due to the necessity of freezing the design early in the process. This study explores the opportunities for optimising the design processes for OSP through the application of modularity. Framed by a large general contractor, the research is based on a case study of façade design, which is representative of design processes for OSP. Research is based on a theoretical framing within design management and modularity, combined with empirical material from 20 interviews and a two-hour-long workshop with a cross-functional design team. The findings were that (1) the application of a modularity perspective in design has the advantage of accelerating the execution process, as the workload and coordination are transferred to the design process, which, in turn, requires enhanced design management. (2) The design structure matrix (DSM), an approach for operationalising modularity theory, is a promising tool for planning and scheduling complex design processes. The DSM method successfully enabled the identification of dependencies and interfaces between the crucial cross-organisational design activities that are related to the façade design process. (3) The developed process modules are helpful to visualise and execute the process for both project participants and managers. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Design process; design structure matrix; modularity in construction; off-site production; prefabricated façades","Construction industry; Human resource management; Product design; Design process; Design Structure Matrices; General contractors; Manufacturing industries; Off-site production; Organisational designs; Planning and scheduling; Project participants; Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026912245

The methods employed for the development of user representations are primarily technical and techno-economic. While our analysis confirms previous findings that economic rationales and automation are central elements of smart grid scripts, the analysis also shows that there is considerable variation in the details of the scripts investigated.

First, they offer immersive engagements which structure user interpretations through various material experiences of handling, use, and extension. Second, they always work via entanglements with related material ecologies such as turntables, speakers, mixers, and rituals of object care. Additionally, these engagements are complimented by a mediation process which emplaces the vinyl historically, culturally, spatially, and also politically, especially in the context of digitalization. This relational process means that both the material affordances and entanglements of vinyl allow us to feel, handle, experience, project, and share its iconicity. The materially mediated meanings of vinyl enabled it to retain currency in independent and collector’s markets and thus resist the planned obsolescence and eventually attain the status of celebrity commodity with totemic power in music communities. This performative aspect of vinyl markets also means that consumers read closely the signals and symbols regarding vinyl’s status, as its various user groups and champions try to interpret its future, protect, or challenge its current position. Vinyl’s future, and the larger expansion of pressing plants and innovative turntable production around it, largely depend on processes of cultural and status mobility. In the current phase of market expansion, vinyl’s status might be challenged by its own success. Neither a fashion cycle phenomenon, nor simple market conditions explain vinyl’s longevity. Rather, cultural contextualization of vinyl as thing and commodity is crucial for avoiding symbolic pollution and retaining sacred aura. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aura; entanglement; heritage; iconicity; marketplace icon; materiality; music; Vinyl record",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982095422

Using evolutionary economic theory, this study investigates the industrial dynamics of the water sector, comparing China and Europe using patent data. This comparison feeds into the “catching up” literature, addressing the challenges of the “green economy” agenda in different regions in various stages of development. We highlight the neglected micro-dynamics of water innovation, investigating the roles of different innovators in the development of water technological trajectories, with a special focus on water innovations closely related to climate change adaptation and mitigation technologies. Public water innovators (universities) were found to be more important in China than in Europe. Similarities were also identified between Europe and China; big companies were found to be the main innovative leaders with no substantial changes documented over the timeframe investigated. Overall, the finding implies a rapid Chinese technological catching up of water technologies in the last three decades, where our research has pointed towards the role of redirection of Chinese policies with a stronger focus on sustainable development.

Similarly, knowledge management also has intricate connections with mechanisms of value creation, through the structuring and improvement of knowledge processes in a given organization. Ensuring that the right knowledge is present is an important part of any business model innovation exercise. By applying the lens of intellectual capital, a natural link between business models and knowledge management is established. From this link, it is possible to structure and describe key characteristics. This paper accounts for the relationships between business models and knowledge management, mediated by intellectual capital, and draws up a schema by which the relationships can be described and discussed.

In this paper, we analyse the North Adriatic ports (Koper, Rijeka, Trieste and Venice) with a focus on two related themes. First, the complementarity of the North Adriatic (NA) ports in the container market is analysed based on port vessel service patterns and shipping line interviews. We operationalize the analysis of complementarity with an analysis of the effects of multiple port calls on the revenue required to make a call in a specific NA port economically feasible. We conclude that the inclusion of another NA port reduces the minimum required revenue for a call in an additional NA port. Second, we assess the scope and depth of cooperation between ports. We map current and potential future cooperation using a 'cooperation matrix' with two dimensions: the involvement of stakeholders (limited vs. broad), and the depth of cooperation (pre-competitive vs. commercial). We use in-depth interviews with port authorities, terminal operators, rail operators, major shipping lines and forwarders in the NA region to position the NA ports in the matrix.

In supply chain research, the classic economic perspective—the business of business is to be profitable—still dominates, followed by coverage of the environmental dimension; the social dimension is underrepresented. Stakeholders, however, are calling for a TBL perspective that simultaneously includes environmental, social, and economic gains. While there have been recent theoretical advances on how to characterize supply chains in terms of their structure, how to connect these insights into supply chain design for TBL sustainability has not been studied. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to move the theory of supply chain forward into the sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) research agenda. Toward that purpose, the paper analyzes the sustainable supply chain design (SSCD) at social businesses, incorporating the physical chain and the information and financial support chains. Four social businesses located in Haiti are used as cases of innovative supply chain structures for TBL sustainability. By analyzing the supply chain structures and boundaries of these social businesses, three supply chain configurations combining physical and support chains are presented. © Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals","case–study research; environmental issues; ethics; social responsibility; supply chain management; sustainability; triple bottom line",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044662660

In this paper the guidance which the maturity model concept offers to understand a PSM organisation's performance is assessed. The methodology is based on the outcomes of a literature review of PSM maturity models, development of an organisational change framework and the learning from three qualitative case studies. An alternative understanding of the development of the PSM organisation is offered through an organisational change framework, composing 1) movement transitions, 2) scalability of change, 3) acceptability of change, and 4) the substantive element of change. The research found that extant PSM maturity models are too rigid for PSM managers to apply, and although maturity models are commonly accepted in PSM literature, in practice, they may produce the opposite effect of what is promised. The PSM maturity models suggest that their application will lead to increased status and influence of PSM within the organisation; expectations that may not be met. PSM organisations’ change processes are subjected to a range of situational and contextual power relations which must be considered in order to advance the specific PSM organisation roles and responsibilities. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Maturity models; Organisational change; Organisational power; Purchasing and supply management practices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043784993

Due to these problematic conceptualizations, and particularly the mixed yet growing state of the literature in marketing, there is a need to revisit the phenomenon. Through a comprehensive review and synthesis of the existing literature, this article identifies the key defining characteristics of consumer fanaticism (i.e. “affective commitment” and “extraordinary pursuit”) and presents a typology (consisting of four types of fanaticism, i.e. rewarding, destructive, stigmatized, and rogue) to demonstrate the socially situated and subjective nature of the fanatic label.

Based on a study of the team-based municipal center CityBiz, the article inquires as to how inequality is embedded in two structural features: first, the differentiation of roles accelerates in response to continuous change, which results in similar workers being attracted to collaborating with one another, which generates inequality. Second, inequality is sustained by inadequate integration methods that merge a formal–informal hierarchy, which results in peer competition and majority elites. The structural approach to organizational diversity developed in this article nuances the current research on diversity that is predominantly concerned with employee experiences of inequality in an organizational structural landscape perceived as fixed and stable. This study offers a dynamic view of organizational structure based on how it is experienced, navigated, and reshaped by employees of different ethnicities. Linking micro-interactions to structural triggers and outcomes points to situated caveats about inequalities ingrained in the organizational structural set-up. Tapping into employees’ sentiments and interactions furthermore gives the possibility to mobilize collective change in favor of equal opportunities. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","Continuous change; critical diversity; formal–informal hierarchy; inequality; organizational structures of differentiation and integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043342745

Managers envisage their organization’s future and make plans for organizational action in a space where ‘business as usual’ reigns, and there is little engagement with the future as fundamentally open – as a time-yet-to-come.

The approach is demonstrated using a case study from the entertainment industry: the festival of Tomorrowland. Following the principles of DA, the specific data structure of the case selected is studied. This structure follows the tribal roles of Cova and Cova, which are then compared with the lead user characteristics of Belz and Baumbach. The different characteristics and roles are used afterwards to establish the user types that may be found in the big data set of the case study. Unlike earlier methods, such as netnography, which focuses on a specific user type as the main source of insights, our results show that DA requires a change of focus from specific individuals to groups of individuals with the capacity to produce the insights of a lead user. DA shows how all the roles in the data structure present different possibilities for innovation. The application of DA to big data enables the extension of analysis to whole populations instead of specific samples, bringing about new possibilities to model and extract the insights of consumers publicly exposed in the digital media. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042225665

However, it is still uncertain whether the ideas identified by such systems will also be regarded as sufficiently novel, feasible and valuable by firms who might decide to develop them further. A validation study is reported in which 200 posts from an online home brewing community were extracted by an automatic idea detection system. Two professionals from a brewing company evaluated the posts in terms of idea content, idea novelty, idea feasibility and idea value. The results suggest that the automatic idea detection system is sufficiently valid to be deployed for the harvesting and initial screening of ideas, and that the profile of the identified ideas (in terms of novelty, feasibility and value) follows the same pattern identified in studies of user ideation in general. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042209270

Our point of departure is the conceptual distinction between organization as style made durable and entrepreneurship as the disruption of style. We show that style is not simply an aesthetic category, but rather what ties different social practices together. While organization makes the connections between social practices durable, entrepreneurship disrupts such patterns. We further elucidate how organization and entrepreneurship are two intermingled processes – those of durability and disruption – that together enable the creation of new styles. In order to conceptualize this creative process, we explore how play can create disharmonies within the organization, but we also maintain that any new practice will remain marginal without a collective assemblage capable of adopting it. On this basis, we argue that sustainable entrepreneurship consists of making an environmentally friendly and socially conscious style durable, but also of disrupting such a style. In order to illustrate our argument, we use the example of the sustainable smartphone producer Fairphone. In conclusion, we argue that the concept of style may strengthen the dialogue between entrepreneurship studies and organization studies. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","entrepreneurship; organization; play; style; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041928095

Noting that this reasoning is fed by a prescriptive/retrospective logic, which tends to marginalize the openness of the ear-body, the article activates auditory concepts to (re)theorize entrepreneurial creation in the empirical context of a strong outcome focus. From ‘rhythm’, ‘composing’ and ‘crescendo’, entrepreneurial creation is theorized as a playful variation, which stays with process and allows the alterity of the other(ness) to resonate – and hence opens up a space for the qualitatively different to emerge.

Using survey data with low-level, white-collar employees, we confirm a positive PSM–job satisfaction association in the public sector compared with the private sector, where we see a negative association.

China is one of the top-five countries with the largest organic area in the world and produces a major part of the world's organic rice. Rice cultivation causes a considerable environmental impact and changing from conventional to organic rice cultivation might therefore have a potentially great impact. Meanwhile, it takes time for the organic farming systems to reach a new steady state after conversion to organic. Thus, the environmental profile of the organic products will change over time and it is therefore important to examine whether the difference to conventional will be reduced (and disappear) or be increased over time. The aim of the present study was therefore to assess the environmental impact of organic rice production 5 (OR5), 10 (OR10) and 15 (OR15) years since conversion and compare it to conventional rice (CR) in subtropical China. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to assess environmental impact of rice production systems with regard to nine environmental impact categories: Non-renewable Energy Depletion (NED), Water Depletion (WD), Land Occupation (LO), Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Eutrophication Potential (EP), Aquatic Toxicity Potential (ATP), Human Toxicity Potential (HTP) and Soil Toxicity Potential (STP). Overall, the results show that the conventional rice production system had the highest comprehensive environmental impact indices (9.65), more than 10 times that of the organic ones. Interestingly, the results showed that the environmental impact indices in the organic rice systems decreased over time from 0.80 (OR5), 0.72 (OR10) to 0.68 (OR15), and thus increased the difference to conventional over the years. The conventional rice had higher impacts from NED, WD, AP, EP, ATP, and HTP, while organic rice had higher LO, GWP and STP indices. The largest environmental index was ATP for conventional and WD for organic rice. Based on this study, organic rice systems have the potential of being recommended as sustainable agricultural practices in comparison with conventional practices. Furthermore, the present study indicated that the difference in the environmental profile of organic versus conventional agricultural products might be underestimated when analyzing organic system that has not yet reached their steady state. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Conventional rice; Life cycle assessment; Operation period; Organic rice; Potential environmental impact; Sustainability","Agricultural products; Agriculture; Cultivation; Eutrophication; Global warming; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Toxicity; Conventional rice; Environmental life cycle assessment; Eutrophication potentials; Human toxicity potentials; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Operation period; Organic rice; Sustainable agricultural; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037620498

Treatments at 800 and 850°C lasted up to 6 weeks. Results indicate that devitrification was strongly activated through presence of heterogeneous nucleation, and that the growth mechanism gradually changed from three-dimensional growth at the onset of devitrification toward one-dimensional growth in later stages, when heterogeneous nucleation was absent or less dominating. Most glasses developed entangled and fibrous microstructures with little or no residual glass phase, which are adequate for rigid sealants, and only one of the laboratory analogue glasses, MCAS, developed microstructures with both more equiaxed grains and a considerable amount of residual glass phase, which may be adequate for more compliant and self-healing sealants as often required in SOC-applications. Even though the glasses lie within a relatively narrow compositional range, resulting phase assemblages differed significantly. Anorthite (plagioclase) developed as the main crystalline phase in all samples together with pyroxene (or pyroxenoide) and cristobalite. Calcium-magnesium-silicate pyroxene (diopside) was in a large part replaced by the calcium-silicate pyroxenoid (wollastonite) in the samples where the mol-proportion MgO:CaO was 1:5 or lower. In samples with a very low MgO proportion and consequently a high CaO proportion, calcium metaborate and calcium aluminum borosilicate (okayamalite) crystallized among the main phases and these glasses crystallized completely within the period of heat treatment. Although cristobalite is metastable at the annealing temperatures, both α and β forms were rapidly formed in most of the samples, likely due to kinetic reasons. The presence of the latter is explained by the stabilization effect of Al and B substitution for Si compensated by Ca stuffing in the structure. The stuffed cristobalite transformed with time to quartz (at 800°C) or quartz plus tridymite (at 850°C). Boron was incorporated in the first crystallizing phases, especially diopside, substituting for Al and Si, but the so established substitution partly disappeared with time during the heat treatment. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society","borosilicate glass; crystals/crystallization; glass-ceramics; phase equilibria","Alkaline earth metals; Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Calcium; Calcium compounds; Ceramic materials; Crystalline materials; Glass ceramics; Glass transition; Heat treatment; Iron compounds; Iron oxides; Magnesia; Magnesium compounds; Microstructure; Nucleation; Phase equilibria; Quartz; Sealants; Silica; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Sodium compounds; Titanium compounds; Titanium dioxide; X ray diffraction; Annealing temperatures; Boroaluminosilicate glass; Calcium magnesium silicates; Devitrification process; Fibrous microstructure; Heterogeneous nucleation; Powder X ray diffraction; Three-dimensional growth; Borosilicate glass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037343316

For two of these glasses devitrification behavior was compared to the devitrification behavior of similar glasses produced in the laboratory. Glasses were characterized after annealing in air at 800°C and 850°C for up to 6 weeks. Even though the glasses lie within a relatively narrow compositional range, sealing performance and the resulting microstructures differed significantly. Best thermomechanical properties was developed in one of the laboratory-produced glasses, MCAS, which may be applied in SOC-stacks by allowing for a slow solidification in the range 750-800°C followed by crystallization at or slightly above 800°C. The relatively high thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) from RT-800°C, 11 × 10−6 K−1, which was developed over ~1000 hours at 800°C, depends mainly on the formation of cristobalite and quartz as well as the presence of a residual glass phase. The glass ceramic sealant appears relatively stable over time, except for a slow transition of cristobalite to quartz, and can possibly show self-healing behavior if later brought close to 850°C.

Our study resulted in the development of an aligning process model that is comprised of three phases (exploratory, building, and extending) and generalizable organizational aligning actions that form the organization's sensing, seizing, and transforming capacities. These aligning actions iteratively reconfigured organizational resources and refined strategy in order to respond to both changes in the environment and internal tensions. We also recognized that there are challenges to alignment, and conceptualized them as paradoxical tensions. This provided insights as to how such tensions are triggered and how they can be addressed.

To structure and integrate previous work, we apply a neo-institutional perspective of the stock market. We argue that at certain times, the institutional support for corporate diversification is relatively low. During these periods, there is a high rate of divestitures. The high divestiture activity legitimizes this corporate action and leads to a positive reaction of the stock market to new divestiture announcements. This means that individual evaluations of the possible performance outcomes of divestments are not the only factor determining the stock market reaction to a corporate divestiture announcement. Rather, investors might consider the perceived institutionalization of this corporate action when making their purchasing decisions. Using a meta-analytical technique, we find support for our prediction that different performance effects of divestitures, as revealed by previous studies, can be attributed to different conditions of the macro-economic environment. We discuss the implications of this result for research and management practice. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Divestitures; Institutional theory; Meta-analysis; Performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023780916

The research question pursued in this article is: 'How do unforeseen events shape managerial strategising?' The theoretical background for this article is inspired by research done within the strategy-as-practice and strategy-in-practice communities and uses concepts such as strategic intent, wayfinding/wayfaring and temporal work to explore how the managers from the small Danish Software Company cooperated with actors in the mining industry. This cooperation was initially perceived as an unforeseen event but, incrementally and retrospectively, it became strategic. The main theoretical and practice-anchored findings draw attention to the roles that unforeseen events can play in shaping strategising. These findings underline the significance of prioritising micro-founded actions carried out contextually by strategists when learning more about the who, what and how of strategising.

We argue that the flexibility and choices now available to airlines constrain the commercial behavior of airports. The main change driving these competitive constraints is that the wealth of opportunities available to airlines have made them more footloose. In addition to this, passengers have more choice available to them, and airports are actively responding to market changes. The result is that airports now largely have to compete with one another to retain and attract traffic. The marked development of airport competition in Europe leads us to recommend that policy makers use a more case-by-case approach to economic regulation of airports. In particular, market power should be established, not assumed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Airport competition; Competitive constraints; Regulation","air transportation; airline industry; airport; competition (economics); regulatory framework; transportation policy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015377069

Design/methodology/approach: This work follows an explorative design with case studies from the grocery retailing industry in Finland, Norway, and the UK. Findings: The tactical planning process focuses on demand management and securing product availability from suppliers in order to reach sales targets. Less attention is directed toward balancing supply and demand or toward providing a single plan to guide company operations. Planning appeared to be functionally oriented with limited coordination between functional plans, but it did include external integration that improved forecast accuracy. Research limitations/implications: The study involves grocery retailer cases with variable levels of S&OP maturity. The propositions need to be investigated further through action research or additional case studies to confirm their validity. Practical implications: The study proposes a design of an S&OP process in retailing and propositions for improving tactical planning integration. Originality/value: The study complements research on retail tactical planning by taking planning process and integration viewpoints. The research suggests that retailers would benefit from a formal and company-wide S&OP process to unify different market-oriented plans to a single set of numbers, thus better balancing supply and demand without sacrificing the emphasis on demand planning. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Grocery; Planning integration; Retail planning; Sales and operations planning; Tactical planning process",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042687392

This point is drawn from a lesson learned from a case study of a renewable energy project, which is called Winds of Change (WoC) in Denmark. In this chapter, the authors firstly regard creativity as a pathway to develop sustainability from a sociocultural approach that also provides a basis of understanding that in the practice of developing sustainability, it requires a co-creative culture. Therefore, they use a systems view and examine co-creative behaviors in the case of WoC through the interplays between three dimensions including domain, field, and individuals (or organizations). Using this case, the authors conclude that a better sustainable world requires a better practice of CSR among organizations based on which the different actors should contribute to their cooperative efforts in a co-creation process of developing sustainability. © 2018, IGI Global.

One reason being the lack of a coherent RD process (RDP). In this contribution we analyse commonly used RD methods to identify their mechanisms and coherences and propose a RDP that is connected to the actual design tasks of the design engineer. The presented RDP comprises four main activities: (1) design and modification of the conceptual design solution, (2) measuring and modelling the robustness of the design, (3) processing and evaluation of the robustness data and (4) scaling of the design to optimise parameter and tolerance values. For each of the activities, the set of relevant RD methods is presented. The main objective of the RDP is to provide the design team with a better overview and understanding of the RD toolbox and to support the application of RD continuously throughout the product development by providing a sequential description of when to apply the methods and how they affect the robustness of the design. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","implementation; process; product development; robust resign; variation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84966693661

Findings: The review found that S&OP design depends on industry, dynamic complexity, detail complexity and organisational characteristics. The findings of the literature review suggest that future research should study the roles of industry, complexity, system and process and organisational characteristics in S&OP design. Research limitations/implications: The findings revealed several gaps in the literature on context-dependent S&OP design.

Shoppers with high degrees of impulsiveness are referred to as hedonic shoppers, and those with low degrees are referred to as prudent consumers. Design/methodology/approach: To investigate the differences between neural processes in the brains of hedonic and prudent shoppers during the trustworthiness evaluation of online-offers, the present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and region-of-interest analysis to correlate neural activity patterns with behavioral measures of the study participants. Findings: Drawing upon literature reviews on the neural correlates of both trust in online settings and consumer impulsiveness and using an experimental design that links behavioral and fMRI data, the study shows that consumer impulsiveness can exert a significant influence on the evaluation of online-offers. With regard to brain activation, both groups (hedonic and prudent shoppers) exhibit similar neural activation tendencies, but differences exist in the magnitude of activation patterns in brain regions that are closely related to trust and impulsiveness such as the dorsal striatum, anterior cingulate, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the insula cortex. Research limitations/implications: The data provide evidence that consumers within the hedonic group evaluate online-offers differently with regard to their trustworthiness compared to the prudent group, and that these differences in evaluation are rooted in neural activation differences in the shoppers’ brains. Practical implications: Marketers need to be made aware of the fact that neurological insights can be used for market segmentation, because consumers’ decision-making processes help explain behavioral outcomes (here, trustworthiness evaluations of online-offers). In addition, consumers can learn from an advanced understanding of their brain functions during decision-making and their relation to personal traits such as impulsiveness. Originality/value: Considering the importance of trust in online shopping, as well as the fact that personality traits such as impulsiveness influence the purchase process to a high degree, this study is the first to systematically investigate the interplay of online trustworthiness perceptions and differences in consumer impulsiveness with neuroscientific methods. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer neuroscience; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Impulsiveness; Online shopping; Trust; Trustworthiness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042368311

Moreover, there is little knowledge about sustainable management of risk and supply chain and the way they impose losses for firms. Risk management's duty in the supply chain is to identify, analyze, and provide solutions for accountability, control and monitor the risks in the economic and production cycle. This study aims to develop a framework for the sustainable supply chain risk management (SSCRM) evaluation. To this end, an integrated fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach is proposed based on the technique in order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) methods. The literature was reviewed and the potential criteria were identified. Through an expert panel the criteria were filtered. Seven main criteria and forty-four sub-criteria were developed for the final evaluation SSCRM framework. The most dominant sub-criteria in each group found to be as; machines & equipment risks, key supplier failures, demand fluctuations, government policy risks, IT security, economic issues, and lack of proper sewage infiltration.

To ensure a smooth and friendly integration between the PV systems and the grid, the power generated by the PV system needs to be flexible and capable of (1) limiting the maximum feed-in power, (2) limiting the maximum power change rate, and (3) providing active power reserve during the operation. This chapter explores the possible solutions to realize the flexible power control requirements. Among other possible approaches, modifying the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) control algorithm of the power converter can realize the flexible power control requirement by regulating the operating point of the PV system below the maximum available power of the PV arrays. Therefore, this approach does not require an extra component, being a cost-effective solution in terms of component cost and at the same time offering high reliability. The operational principle of the PV systems with the modifying MPPT algorithm is discussed in this chapter, where the flexible active power control functionalities are demonstrate via experiments on a two-stage grid-connected PV system. The experimental results verify that the power-limiting control, power ramp-rate control, and power reserve control functionalities can be achieved upon demands. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PCSs have recently attracted increased attention both from the researches and practitioners. There are variety of challenges reported in the literature as consequences of using PCS, which reduces the usage frequency of the system. To address those challenges, IT integrations can be an effective solution to reduce the number of manual tasks and complexity inside PCSs and make PCSs more user friendly. However, the influence of integrating PCS to different IT systems on usage frequency has not been addressed in the literature. This paper aims to study the relationship of PCS usage frequency in terms of (1) different application area of the PCSs, and (2) integrations to different IT systems.

Once a disruption materializes, the company losses will depend on the coherence and swiftness of the supply chain response (resilience). However, current resilience frameworks are qualitative, do not address evolution over time as a relevant aspect, and thus do not provide indications on how to design a resilient response. This paper contributes to closing this gap by developing a system dynamics model from an actual case of resilient response after a cyber-attack. Both case-specific and generic structures are extracted from the case data analysis, and a reaction mechanism is proposed that results in the observed behavior. The identification of these structures should eventually aid decision makers in the process of designing a resilient supply chain response. © 2017 IEEE.","Cyber-risk; Resilience; System Dynamics","Crime; Decision making; Digital storage; Network security; Plant shutdowns; Supply chains; System theory; Cyber-attacks; Decision makers; Digital information; Generic structure; Reaction mechanism; Resilience; System Dynamics; System dynamics model; Computer crime",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045264030

Using revenue growth theory, this study examines how the use of circular supply chains can grow the revenue of manufacturers of assembled industrial products (e.g. process equipment and engines). Findings show that the circular supply chain can increase revenue streams from the firm's existing markets, create market opportunities in new geographies, and provide access to market segments un-addressable with the firm's new products.

We suggest that combinations involving integrative search strategies–combining internal and external knowledge–are the most likely to generate product and process innovation. In this context, we present the idea that cognitively distant knowledge sources are helpful for innovation only when used in conjunction with knowledge sources that are closer to the focal firm. We also find important differences between product and process innovation, with the former associated with broader searches than the latter.

It is argued that global sourcing, which is also associated with 'offshoring' and 'offshore outsourcing', has co-evolved over the last three decades with the advancement of information and communication technology, a growing pool of low-cost, yet-often-qualified labour and expertise in developing countries, and increasing client-side global sourcing experience. It is shown how this dynamic has led firms to develop new global capabilities, governance and business models, changed the geographical distribution of work and expertise, and promoted the emergence of new geographical knowledge services clusters. Further, three new trends are introduced-the emergence of global delivery models, information technology-enabled service automation, and impact sourcing-and discuss future directions for research. © Oxford University Press 2018.

The hypothesis is that creative and innovative processes are similar in that both are affective in nature. I develop this conceptual framework through an interpretation of the insights of Henri Poincaré’s notion of the ‘four stages’ in the creative process and Joseph Schumpeter’s notion of the entrepreneur. Building on this framework, I analyze the creative and innovative practices of the film director Lars von Trier and the entrepreneur Steve Jobs. The interpretation and analysis suggest that the processes of creativity and innovation are similar in nature in that both are based on the moods of disturbance and enthusiasm; but that they differ in that creativity is based on the feelings of interest and irritation, whereas innovation is based on the feelings of desire and anger. In the conclusion I discuss the implications of this for responsible innovation with regard to the social aspect of resistance towards innovation and the ethical aspects of anger in entrepreneurial leadership. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Affect; Anger; Creativity; Innovation; Lars von Trier; Steve Jobs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058572329

The literature on global production networks only recently began to pay more detailed attention to conceptualizing the role that labour plays in such networks and has so far focused mainly on industrial settings – not smallholder farming. Similarly, the literature on sustainability standards has focused on wage-workers in large-scale workplaces such as factories or plantations. This article seeks to remedy this lack of attention and make contributions to both literatures by arguing first, that labour agency in export-oriented smallholder tea production in developing countries may not be advanced much by the sustainability certifications demanded by Western buyers and second, that labour agency can nevertheless be present at ‘the margins’ of global production networks even though informal rural wage workers are most often assumed to lack both ‘structural’ and ‘associational’ power. These arguments are made on the basis of a case study of on-farm wage labour in smallholder tea production in Kenya. The article finds labour’s bargaining power to be stronger in some locations compared to others and that differences between locations can be fruitfully explored by looking not just at workers insertion into the vertical structures of the global production network but by also including more ‘horizontal’ dimensions relating to the local context in which smallholder tea production and on-farm wage-workers are embedded. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Kenya; Labour agency; smallholder tea; sustainability standards; wage workers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046819329

A retail field study demonstrates that male customers spend more money and purchase more expensive products than their female counterparts in the presence (vs. absence) of a physically dominant male employee. This effect has a more powerful impact on male customers who lack bodily markers of dominance (shorter stature or measures linked to lower levels of testosterone). When confronted with other physically dominant (vs. nondominant) men, these male customers are particularly prone to signal status through price or logo size. Their elevated feelings of intrasexual (male-tomale) competitiveness drive them to spend more money on status-signaling, but not functional, products and to prefer and draw larger brand logos. Because pictorial exposure is sufficient for the effect to occur, these findings are not limited to in-store interactions with dominant male employees but have broad implications for marketing and advertising. © 2018, American Marketing Association.","2D:4D digit ratio; Evolutionary psychology; Field study; Physical dominance; Status-signaling consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046815723

Over time, full coverage of occupational pensions was achieved in both countries, yet with different scopes, degrees of risk-sharing and modes of governance. Why did both countries go through similar institutional changes, and why were the outcomes still so different? The roads to full coverage were different: In Denmark, this was achieved through wage bargaining; in Norway, through mandating. Denmark developed far more collectivistic schemes than Norway, but recent developments indicate convergence: efforts are being made in Norway to develop encompassing schemes more similar to the Danish ones, while the Danish system appears to be moving in a more individual direction. In both countries, strong trade union branches have at critical junctures forged alliances with their employer counterparts at the expense of trade union solidarity. Both mandatory and negotiated schemes thus have the potential to be sources of solidarity as well as of self-interest within the union movement. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","industrial relations; Occupational pensions; risk-sharing; trade unions; tripartite agreement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042289410

The focus of our analysis is on changes at the extensive and intensive firm-level margins of trade, as well as on performance differences (jobs, productivity and firm survival) across firms that differ in their export status. We find no adverse effects of the financial crisis on foreign market entry or exit, but a considerable increase in the export intensity of firms after the financial crisis. Moreover, we find that exporters were more resilient to the crisis than non-exporters. Finally, while exporters showed a significantly more favourable development of total factor productivity after 2009 than non-exporters, aggregate productivity declined substantially in a large number of industries in Spanish manufacturing. We also briefly explore two factors that might help explain the surprisingly strong export performance of Spain in the aftermath of the great trade collapse: improved aggregate competitiveness due to internal and external devaluation and a substitutive relationship between domestic and foreign sales at the firm level. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","financial crisis; firm-level data; international trade; manufacturing; Spain","competitiveness; economic instability; export; financial crisis; international trade; manufacturing; total factor productivity; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041897024

This paper investigates how formal, i.e. transformational, transactional and empowering, leadership styles affect employees’ perceived agency in distributed leadership, and whether these associations are mediated by employees’ perceived organizational efficacy. Based on large-scale survey data from a study at one of Scandinavia’s largest public hospitals (N = 1,147), our results show that all leadership styles had a significant positive impact on employees’ perceived agency in distributed leadership. Further, organizational efficacy related negatively to employees’ perceived agency in distributed leadership; however, a mediatory impact of this on the formal leadership styles-distributed leadership relationship was not detected. These results emphasize the importance of formal leaders to enhance employee involvement in various leadership functions; still, employees might prefer to participate in leadership functions when they perceive that the organization is struggling to achieve its goals. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Distributed leadership; empowering leadership; health care; organizational efficacy; transactional leadership; transformational leadership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041840838

In traditional courses, students accumulate knowledge and the educator’s primary concern is what students learn. When learning ‘through’ practising entrepreneurship, students and educators must also care about how students learn. While research brought awareness to this area of concern more than a decade ago, feedback and assessment in entrepreneurship education have received very limited attention. This article addresses these issues both theoretically and empirically. The findings allow the authors to map out the feedback mechanisms needed in experimental entrepreneurship education and to provide an embedded two-by-two model that describes the purpose and outcome of the feedback. The findings also suggest an approach for design and assessment that may help resolve the pedagogical and legitimacy challenges of such courses. These contributions are directly relevant for students, educators and administrators involved with entrepreneurship courses, and they may be applicable to a wider range of process-based courses. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.","Assessment; course design; entrepreneurial learning; experiential learning; feedback; legitimacy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041593285

Theoretically, the article combines Bourdieu’s theory of class-based practices with Boltanski and Thévenot’s theory of situated judgement in order to better understand how social class and moral values are connected. Empirically, the article analyses how social class might constrain or enable certain types of justification for food consumption. Using quantitative data on Danish food consumers’ attitudes to food, shopping and cooking, together with information on their social background, the analysis investigates the relation between consumers’ use of five orders of worth (Civic, Industrial, Inspired, Domestic and Health, and Market) and their cultural, economic and social capital as well as socio-demographic background. The main results are that four of the orders of worth (Civic, Industrial, Inspired and Market) are strongly related to consumers’ cultural capital, and to some extent social capital, but not to economic capital. Other background variables such as age and gender also influence which consumers adhere to different food evaluation criteria. The results support the notion that plural moralities are at play in food consumption, especially within groups with high cultural capital. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","Boltanski and Thévenot; Bourdieu; Food consumption; justification; orders of worth; quantitative analysis; social class",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041097161

This article challenges the essentialism inherent in this model by proposing a different framing of cosmopolitan identity formation that shifts the focus to how people collectively mobilize cosmopolitanism as a resource for cultural identity construction. The article is based on an anthropological study of transnational professionals who are part of a diverse expatriate community in Amsterdam. The analysis shows how these professionals draw on cosmopolitanism to define themselves as ‘non-nationals’. This involves downplaying national affiliations and cultural differences while also marking national identity categories and ‘cultural features’ to maintain the difference they collectively embrace. This, however, does not imply openness to all otherness. Boundary drawing to demarcate the cosmopolitan ‘us’ in relation to national (mono)culture is equally important. The article argues that cosmopolitan identities are socially accomplished as particular modes of collective belonging that are part of – not beyond – a global discursive sphere of identity politics. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","cosmopolitan identity formation; cosmopolitanism; cultural identity and belonging; expatriate communities; global mobility; self-initiated expatriates; skilled migration; translocality; transnational professionals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040456933

Drawing on queer theory, the article develops a mode of analysis, called ‘promiscuous coding’, conducive to disrupting the gender divisions that currently anchor most leadership metaphors. Promiscuous coding can assist leadership scholars by translating the vague promise of queering leadership into a tangible method distinguished by specific habits. The article formulates this analytical practice out of empirical provocations encountered by the authors: namely, a striking mismatch between their experiences in military fields and the dominant metaphor of leading as military command. Ultimately, the article seeks to move scholarly practices of leadership toward queer performativity, in the hopes of loosening other leadership practices from a binary grip and pointing toward new relational possibilities. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","gender; leadership; metaphor; military command; queer; sexuality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040455542

Based on Rhetorical Arena Theory, this article examines two research questions: (1) How do trade associations prepare for crises that may arise for their member organizations and/or for themselves? and (2) How do trade associations communicate during a crisis involving one or more of their members and/or themselves? Do they speak with “one voice,” or do they pursue different strategies?

Though scholars have increasingly become aware of deep-rooted social inequalities in access to volunteering in the adult population, differences in opportunity structures that facilitate participation among young people are rarely recognized. In this paper, I put forward a ‘life-track perspective’ on youth volunteerism that highlights crucial within-group differences among youths. I present empirical findings from a unique Danish national survey with multiple waves enriched with national register data. The study sheds light on the changing importance of longstanding dividing lines—gender, social class, and education—in volunteering trends among the young. While young people are seemingly more gender-equal in their volunteering behavior than older cohorts, higher education as a gateway to volunteering is of much greater importance among the young. This educational ‘elitism’ in volunteering has, furthermore, intensified among young people between 2004 and 2012. © 2017, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Civic engagement; Life-track; Social inequality; Status positions; Youth volunteerism","civil society; cohort analysis; gender relations; higher education; social conflict; social participation; young population; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038380443

How such policy might be designed, however, is uncertain, as are the costs and benefits of such policies. It is also not clear whether there is a problem for user-directed policy to solve, or what that problem is. As a first empirical step to answering these questions, we report the results of providing hospital clinicians with access to ‘makerspaces’, i.e. staffed facilities with prototyping tools and the expertise in using them. Findings suggest that almost all innovations developed in the makerspaces are user innovations; that the potential returns from the innovations developed in the makerspaces’ first year of operation are more than tenfold the required investment; and that most of the innovations would not have been developed without access to makerspaces. Due to lack of diffusion, only a limited share of potential returns is realized. This suggests not only that there are problems of non-development and under-development that policy can solve and that doing so supports social welfare. It also suggests makerspaces as an effective form of user-supporting innovation policy. © 2017","Clinicians; Healthcare; Innovation; Innovation policy; Makerspaces; User innovation","Engineering; Health care; Innovation; Clinicians; Costs and benefits; First year; Innovation policies; Makerspaces; Prototyping tools; Social welfare; User innovation; Hospitals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034806398

However, the “human side” of open innovation is still poorly understood. We consider the role of employee characteristics with respect to predicting firm-level openness. Drawing on the human capital, learning and creativity literatures, we theorize that knowledge diversity of the firm's employees is positively associated with employees’ ability to identify and absorb external knowledge, which aggregates to increased firm-level openness—that is, firms’ use of external knowledge in their pursuit of innovation. Based on a combination of three data sources, namely, two survey data sources and register data, we find support for our hypothesis that employees’ educational diversity is positively associated with firm-level openness. However, we find no direct association between employees’ work history diversity and firm-level openness but rather—as also hypothesized—a conditional relationship based on educational background, which implies that diverse work history only has a positive impact at higher levels of educational diversity. To reduce endogeneity concerns, we undertake a series of robustness checks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Diversity; Education; Employees; Human capital; Microfoundations; Open innovation","Innovation; Personnel; Data-sources; Diversity; Endogeneity; External knowledge; Human capitals; Knowledge diversity; Micro-foundations; Open innovation; Education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033791304

This introduction to the special issue on the wider implications of business-model research argues that part of this struggle relates to the application of five different perspectives on the term “business model,” which creates ambiguity about the conceptual boundaries of business models, the applied terminology, and the potential contributions of business-model research to strategic management literature. By explicitly distinguishing among these five perspectives and by aligning them into one overarching, comprehensive framework, this paper offers a foundation for consolidating business-model research. Furthermore, we explore the connections between business-model research and prominent theories in strategic management. We conclude that business-model research is not necessarily a “theory on its own” and that it can be more fruitfully understood as a theoretical mechanism for combining different literature streams. As such, business-model research is positioned as a central connecting component in the further development of the strategic management field. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Alignment; Archetype; Business model; Definition; Logics; Typology","Alignment; Strategic planning; Archetype; Business modeling; Definition; Logics; Typology; Research and development management; business; conceptual framework; management practice; planning theory; research work; strategic approach; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027245615

Distance between MNC home and host countries, however, alienates subsidiaries from the MNC and influences the extent of subsidiary host country political embeddedness. We suggest that the host country political and regulatory context moderates the effect of distance on subsidiary host country political embeddedness by reducing the need and/or value of headquarters support.

This paper investigates the culture-innovation relationship in a European context, as well as the mediating role of the national-level trust in this connection. Data are used to test the hypotheses that a country's innovation performance is influenced by its cultural value emphases and societal trust, and that the culture-innovation relationship is mediated by societal trust. Based on data from the Global Innovation Index and the European Social Survey covering 27 European countries, we find that innovation at the country level is positively correlated with the level of societal trust and with three cultural value dimensions: ""Autonomy versus Embeddedness"", ""Egalitarianism versus Hierarchy"", and ""Harmony versus Mastery"". A multivariate SEM analysis reveals that when ""Autonomy versus Embeddedness"" is controlled, the two other cultural value dimensions are no longer significant. Further, a SEM path analysis confirms that the relationship between cultural values and innovation performances is completely mediated through the level of trust in a society. Overall, ""Autonomy versus Embeddedness"" has a stronger total effect than societal trust on a country's innovation performance, but most of this effect is indirect, mediated through societal trust. Implications of our findings for the corporate level (i.e., entrepreneurs and managers) as well as for the institutional settings (i.e., policy makers) are discussed. It is suggested that for successful innovation to blossom, the actors on both levels should aim at strengthening the cultural emphasis on individual autonomy, institutional integrity and mutual trust. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","Cross-cultural; Innovation.; Social capital; Trust; Values",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020553664

Using survey data that were collected at two different points in time (2006–2008) among 1664 workers from 60 Danish workplaces, we examined the total, direct and indirect effects between quality of leadership and workplace bullying. Our results indicate that quality of leadership plays a role in establishing working conditions that lead to workplace bullying. Furthermore, social community at work fully mediates the effect of poor quality of leadership on workplace bullying. This longitudinal study adds to previous cross-sectional studies on the substantial role played by leaders in the bullying process.

The work has been designed as a case study focusing on the replenishment process among various stores and a single warehouse. Food waste metrics of products ordered through an automatic replenishment program are compared against products ordered manually. Specifically we contrast food waste, remaining shelf life and availability at the stores for a variety of products with different shelf life. The study suggests that by utilising an automatic replenishment program the stores can reduce their level of food waste by up to 20% and their products have a longer remaining shelf life without compromising on-shelf availability. The study also indicates that the impact of the automatic replenishment program is dependent on the product’s shelf life. Those products with a shelf life of between 51 and 110 days experience the highest impact, while products with a shelf life below 30 days experience a low or even negative impact. The study extends the current understanding of automatic replenishment programs. The key point for practitioners is to apply appropriate replenishment programs according to the product characteristics and especially the shelf life. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","automatic replenishment; food waste; Information sharing; remaining shelf life; shelf life","Food supply; Supply chains; Food waste; Grocery stores; Information sharing; Keypoints; On shelf availabilities; Product characteristics; Shelf life; Food preservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031114619

Countries announced actions under the Nationally Determined Contributions outlining domestic mitigation actions to achieve the global target. Understanding the impact of these actions on achieving these ambitions requires an assessment of long term national level scenarios. Limited studies currently exist that model long term scenarios at national level addressing the impacts of Nationally Determined Contributions and the additional actions required, especially at the sectoral level. The paper compares four alternate future scenarios for India spanning till 2050, with a specific focus on the passenger and freight transportation. The analysis is performed using the ANSWER MARKAL model and complemented with methodologies to estimate transportation demand under strong decarbonisation pathways. The results show that 1.5 °C scenario would need immediate actions and deep transformations. Demand side actions would, in addition to infrastructure investments require transforming human behaviour through use of information technology, internet and sharing economy. Clean vehicle technologies need to play a much bigger role and fossil fuel dependence would be moderated with the dominance of electricity, hydrogen and biofuels. The higher share of electricity in transport is complimented with accelerated decarbonisation of electricity. This transformation required for 1.5 °C scenario calls for innovations that would be driven through national and sectoral policies and explicit carbon prices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","1.5 °C Scenario; Implicit carbon price; Low carbon transport; Nationally Determined Contributions; Price elasticity","Behavioral research; Costs; Decarbonization; Economics; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Investments; Carbon price; Global temperatures; Infrastructure investment; Low carbon transport; Nationally Determined Contributions; Price elasticity; Temperature stabilization; Transportation demand; Freight transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038884544

Published LCA studies rarely specify and justify their modelling choices. Since LCA studies are typically performed within the context of social responsibility and product life cycle management, this article investigates the relationship between social responsibility paradigms and the system modelling choices in LCA. We identify three different social responsibility paradigms: Value chain responsibility, Supply chain responsibility and Consequential responsibility. We point out that while there is no generally right or wrong choice of system model, each responsibility paradigm implies a specific matching system model. We then argue that all responsibility paradigms ultimately imply a consequential perspective, namely that of responding to the concerns of the system stakeholders. Although value or supply chains are systems defined without concern for consequences, and thus may include activities that the decision maker cannot influence, the chosen system is still analysed and assessed by accounting for its social consequences, and it is for these consequences that social responsibility is then taken. We argue that it is inconsistent to exclude consequences of own actions (i.e. the consequential system) while including consequences from actions of others in value chain or supply chain. We thus conclude that a consistent socially responsible decision-maker must always take responsibility for the activities in the consequential product life cycle and may additionally take responsibility for the consequences of other activities in the value chain or supply chain. We end the article with recommendations on reporting on LCA system models that are more specific than those of the current LCA standards. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Product life cycle; Sphere of influence; Supply chain; System modelling; Value chain","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Supply chains; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Product life cycle management; Product life cycles; Social responsibilities; Sphere of influences; System modelling; Value chains; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038880253

In the first four scenarios, the sludge residues were applied on agricultural land, while in the fifth scenario ash from sludge incineration was landfilled. It was found that the sludge treatment technology influenced in which processes carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) emissions happened. In general, the INC scenario performed better than or comparably to the scenarios with land application of the sludge. Human toxicity (non-carcinogenic) and eco-toxicity showed the highest normalised impact potentials for all the scenarios with land application. In both categories, impacts were dominated by the application of zinc and copper to agricultural soil. For the eutrophication potentials, different scenarios appeared beneficial depending on the receiving compartment in focus. The fate of phosphorus (P) dominated freshwater eutrophication, while the fate of N had a profound effect on all non-toxic impact categories other than freshwater eutrophication. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were sensitive to soil and precipitation conditions. The ranking of scenarios was affected by local conditions for marine eutrophication. Overall, the present study highlighted the importance of including all sludge treatment stages and conducting a detailed N flow analysis, since the emission of reactive N into the environment is the major driver for almost all non-toxic impact categories. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Emission factors; Incineration; Land application; Lime stabilisation; Organic fertiliser; Sludge treatment","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Carbon; Dewatering; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Incineration; Life cycle; Lime; Sensitivity analysis; Sewage sludge; Stabilization; Toxicity; Waste incineration; Water; Anaerobically digested sludges; Emission factors; Eutrophication potentials; Land applications; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lime stabilisation; Sewage sludge treatment; Sludge treatment; Sludge digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038879955

Despite this shift, only a few works have addressed sustainable Economic Production Quantity (EPQ). The theoretical sustainable EOQ and EPQ models are basic models that ignore many real-life conditions such as the possibility of stock-out in inventory systems. In this paper, we develop four new sustainable economic production quantity models that consider different shortage situations. To find optimal values of inventory system variables, we solve four independent profit maximization problems for four different situations. These proposed models include a basic model in which shortages are not allowed, and when shortages are allowed, the lost sale, full backordering and partial backordering models can be selected by operations managers depending on the manufacturer's motivation to improve service levels. We have also proposed an algorithm for determining optimum values of the decision variables for these sustainable economic production quantity models. Finally, the formulated models are explained with some different examples and the obtained results have been analyzed and discussed. These results show that the sustainable economic production quantity with partial backordering model is a general and more realistic model that can be used in many real cases with a reasonable profit amount, compared with the three other proposed models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental considerations; Inventory control; Partial-backordering; Shortage; Sustainable development; Sustainable economic production quantity models","Inventory control; Planning; Profitability; Decision variables; Environmental concerns; Environmental considerations; Operations managers; Partial backordering; Profit maximization; Shortage; Sustainable economics; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038877316

Box 47AA  6700, Netherlands","Manure treatment technologies have been developed in Europe to better use animal manures and to reduce their environmental impact, but the adoption of these technologies in practice is regionally diverse and still limited. Also, little is known about the opinions of stakeholders towards manure treatment. This study aimed to identify stakeholder perceptions of (1) which factors can facilitate and hinder the implementation in practice, (2) which technologies have the most potential for successful adoption, and (3) how farm characteristics and scale of treatment operations affect priorities for technology adoption. This analysis used data from a survey of various stakeholders engaged in manure treatment in four European countries (Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain) that have large areas of high animal density, but diverse socio-economic, political and environmental conditions. Pressure from governmental regulations was perceived as a key factor that stimulated manure treatment in all four countries (70% of respondents). Processing manure to produce bioenergy was considered important in Denmark and Italy, but less important in Spain and the Netherlands. The major barriers to technology adoption were related to economic factors -lack of investment capital (60% of respondents), high processing cost (52%) and a long payback period (45%), while there was relatively little concern regarding transport and noise burden and health risks. Slurry separation and anaerobic digestion were perceived to have the greatest potential for a common adoption. Other preferred technologies were more country-specific (e.g. acidification in Denmark, composting in Spain, and drying and reverse osmosis in Netherlands). Manure treatment was considered to be less applicable at small livestock farms. Separation, composting and acidification were perceived to be more applicable at farm scale, while drying, anaerobic digestion, reverse osmosis at large, industrial scales.

This objective of this study is to present a novel group multi-attribute decision analysis method for prioritizing the MSW treatment alternatives based on the interval-valued fuzzy set theory. This study allows multiple stakeholders to participate in the process of decision-making and they are also allowed to use linguistic variables to rate the alternatives and determine the weights of the evaluation criteria. The interval-valued fuzzy group decision making trail and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method was developed to determine the weights of the evaluation criteria by considering the independent relationships among these criteria. The multi-actor interval-valued fuzzy grey relational analysis was developed to rank the waste-to-energy scenarios. Four alternative processes for MSW treatment including landfill, anaerobic digestion, incineration, and gasification were studied by the developed model, and the results reveal that the developed model can successfully help the stakeholders to determine the priority sequence of the alternative MSW treatment scenarios. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Interval-valued fuzzy decision making trail and evaluation laboratory; Interval-valued fuzzy grey relational analysis; Interval-valued fuzzy set; Multi-criteria decision making; Municipal solid waste","Anaerobic digestion; Decision making; Decision theory; Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Group theory; Incineration; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Best available technologies; Fuzzy - Multi criteria decision making; Fuzzy Decision making; Fuzzy-grey relational analysis; Interval-valued fuzzy set theory; Interval-valued fuzzy sets; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-attribute decision analysis; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038820029

The aim of this study was to determine whether methane yield from wheat straw could be improved by using alkali at low concentration and ambient temperature if the fiber fraction had previously undergone mechanical pretreatment. After combining mechanical and alkali pretreatment, a linear correlation between alkali concentration and hydrolysis of the fiber content, mainly hemicelluloses, was found. A positive effect by combining briquetting of wheat straw with sodium hydroxide addition was found with the hemicellulose content decreasing by up to 66%. In general, alkali improved the ultimate methane yield and the methane yield obtained after 30 days. Briquetting reduced the optimal alkali concentration needed to reach the maximal improvement in methane yield compared to merely shredding. The results proved that it is not necessary to work with the high alkali concentrations traditionally used to improve methane production if the straw is mechanically pretreated prior to alkali addition. Methane yield obtained after 30 days as well as net energy yield rose by around 40% when briquetting was combined with 2% sodium hydroxide. Therefore, a low concentration of alkali, especially sodium hydroxide, applied at ambient temperature can improve the energy and the economic balance of pretreatment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Briquetting; Methane; Potassium hydroxide; Sodium hydroxide; Wheat straw","Biodegradation; Briquetting; Caustic soda; Cellulose; Methane; Potash; Potassium compounds; Potassium hydroxide; Sodium; Straw; Temperature; Alkali concentrations; Alkali pretreatment; Low cost technology; Mechanical pre-treatment; Methane production; Sodium hydroxides; Ultimate methane yields; Wheat straws; Sodium compounds; Methane; Potassium Hydroxide; Sodium Hydroxide; Wheat Straw",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038819024

Nanoadsorbents as an emerging product and a special application of nanomaterial play an important role in the control and removal of environmental pollutants. This application is still an emerging technology at the early stages of development. Hence, the heart of this study enables an environmental assessment of nanoadsorbents as an emerging product. In addition, the environmental impacts of synthesized adsorbents including cumulative energy demand, climate change, water use, human toxicity, and ecotoxicity are investigated by a stepwise procedure during their synthesis processes, regarding their potential to remove mercury from polluted water. Accordingly, characterization results showed that although the process of the functionalization of nanoadsorbents leads to the increase of the adsorption capacity of nanoadsorbents, it is also paired with a significant enhancement of negative environmental impacts. The results of t-test comparing the cradle-to-use life cycle impacts of studied impact categories for 1 kg Hg removal between MGO-NH-SH and Fe3O4@SiO-NH-SH estimated approximately 37, 34, 40, 31, and 26% more for climate change, water use, cumulative energy demand, human toxicity, and ecotoxicity, respectively for the latter. Hence, according to the results, Fe3O4@SiO-NH-SH revealed the larger environmental impacts from the same functional unit, 1 kg Hg removal, compared with MGO-NH-SH. Finally, not only does this study represents the LCA of two different kinds of mercury adsorbents, but it also provides a guideline for determining the environmental impacts of similar nanoadsorbents. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","LCA; Mercury; Nanoadsorbents; Prospective approach; Removal","Climate change; Energy management; Life cycle; Mercury (metal); Removal; Toxicity; Water pollution; Adsorption capacities; Cumulative energy demands; Environmental assessment; Environmental pollutants; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Nanoadsorbents; Prospective approach; Technological development; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038809097

This article pursues research questions concerning concrete innovations aiming to create bioeconomic transition options in Norway and presents results from a transdisciplinary investigation of Norwegian food industry cases involving processing of fish, meat, fruit, and vegetable co-streams aiming to capture or even increase use and value of residues from processing. It shows that while objectives of avoiding food losses and transforming co-streams to new products of higher value characterizes the poultry industry case and part of the ‘blue’ sector, challenges remain particularly in the ‘whitefish’ area where - also at the global level - a high share of fish resources ends as rest raw materials, i.e. not fully utilised. The investigation targeted strategic cases of innovations enabling alternative uses of co-streams: automation and scanning technologies for fractioning raw materials and co-streams into different qualities, a collection system for fish rest raw materials at sea, enzymatic hydrolysis, use of second grade vegetables for smoothies and potato peels for biodegradable plastics in the vegetable (potato) processing industries. The article shows how these innovations enable cascading and valorisation of co-streams and why an upcycling potential exists as well.

Prompted by a reading of skeptical philosophy, the book defines strategy as the on-going presentation of an organization form to itself and others, and embeds this definition in a discussion of the wider modern project of 'knowing and declaring oneself'. Three related and often interwoven kinds of strategic self presentation are identified: the use of representational knowledge, the creation of vision, and the assertion of will. All three assume the job of strategy is to work on and improve everyday life. This book flips such a concern, and asks whether strategic inquiry might benefit from being worked over by everyday life. Judgment is introduced as the poetic capacity by which this opening up can happen. Taking forays into the work of Georges Perec, Virginia Woolf, Immanuel Kant, Adam Smith, William Hazlitt, Rainer Marie Rilke, Judith Butler, William Shakespeare, John Ruskin, and Hannah Arendt, amongst others, the book argues for a form of judgment likened to 'unhomely spectating'. © Robin Holt 2018.

Although various advantages have been identified that emerge from the application of a circular economy, no concrete studies exist that investigate current state-of-the-art drivers, barriers and practices in this relevant field. An in-depth exploration of current practices would enhance the circular economy’s significance and would help understand its present level of implementation. With this concern, this study provides an analysis of the drivers, barriers and practices that influence the implementation of the circular economy in the context of supply chains through a systematic review. In order to analyse the circular economy’s level of implementation, we correlate stakeholders’ perspectives with drivers, barriers, and practices; thus, a multi-perspective framework is proposed. From the results, it is evident that among various stakeholders, the governmental perspective has the maximum positive impact on the implementation of the circular economy in supply chains. Specifically, the circular economy can be promoted through laws, policies, risk reduction (through tax levies) and strict governance. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","barriers; circular economy; drivers; multi-perspective framework; practices; systematic review","Mathematical models; Production engineering; Truck drivers; barriers; Circular economy; Multi-perspective frameworks; practices; Systematic Review; Supply chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040995827

It is a form of collaborative supply chain management aiming to make industry more sustainable and achieve collective benefits based on utilization of waste, by-products, and excess utilities between economically independent industries. Based on an extensive analysis of published studies on existing IS collaborations and interviews with central stakeholders of a comprehensive IS, this paper investigates IS from a supply chain collaboration perspective. A theoretical framework is built and used to discuss how industrial symbiosis pursues sustainability and to identify the main collaboration aspects and performance impacts. This framework is then used in the analysis of selected published cases. Based on this, we derive propositions on the organizational and operational requirements for collaboration in the context of IS networks, related to the supply chain integration and coordination practices. As IS has only received little attention in the operations and supply chain management community, our propositions directly lead to future research directions. Furthermore, the analysis in this paper provides directions to increase the feasibility and resource efficiency of IS networks and can hence be used by stakeholders involved in these networks. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Collaboration; Industrial symbiosis; Resource efficiency; Supply chain; Sustainability","Computer supported cooperative work; Efficiency; Industrial economics; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Waste management; Circular economy; Collaboration; Collaborative supply chain management; Future research directions; Industrial symbiosis; Industrial symbiosis network; Operations and supply chain managements; Resource efficiencies; Supply chain management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034579835

It has become part of the political agenda, where regulation is the main driver, but the maritime industry itself has also been driven towards more energy-efficient operation of the vessels, due to increasing fuel costs. Improving the energy efficiency on board vessels is not only a technical issue - factors such as awareness of the problem, knowledge skills and motivation are also important parameters that must be considered. The paper shows how training in energy-efficient operation and awareness can affect the energy consumption of vessels. The study is based on navigational, full-mission simulator tests conducted at the International Maritime Academy SIMAC. A full-mission simulator is an image of the world allowing the students to obtain skills through learning-by-doing in a safe environment. Human factors and technical issues were included and the test sessions consisted of a combination of practical simulator exercises and reflection workshops.

Empirically, three defining junctions demonstrate the malleability of the entrepreneurial project in perpetual action, expanding beyond effectuation theory on what constitutes given means, affordable loss, and other key concepts from this theoretical perspective. Drawing upon actor-network theory (ANT), this study demonstrates how different framing and support devices implicate different human and non-human actors in changing interpositions within the entrepreneurial process. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses a longitudinal case study design. The case provides an overview of a new business’s emergence based on three identified translations, each representing critical junctures in the business’s development. An ethnographic approach is selected, which combines observations with qualitative interviews. This design allows the authors to focus on how the project emerges and is continuously supported by allies but is sometimes not supported by various human and non-human actors. Findings: This study demonstrates that the entrepreneurial project undertaken by the entrepreneurial network changes as new humans or non-humans become part of it. Including a resource in the network means simultaneously changing the network. This interactionism shows that what sparks interest or attracts resources to a business idea is not simply an influx of additional resources but is simultaneously a dynamic definition of the entrepreneurial endeavour. Originality/value: This paper examines how ideas are transformed into business ventures by using the ANT to expand understanding from effectuation theory. This shows that means, for instance, are not given but are co-created by the process of translation. In addition, which losses are affordable can be determined by the process within which the entrepreneur frames the project and manages to associate allies within and into the network. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Actor-network theory; Effectuation; Entrepreneurship project; Translations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033605487

There is, however, still a dearth of research that sheds light on the competitive attributes that define platform competition from an architectural standpoint. To disentangle platform competition, we opted for the mobile payment market in the United Kingdom as our empirical setting. By conceptualizing digital platforms as layered modular architectures and embracing the theoretical lens of strategic groups, this study supplements prior research by deriving a taxonomy of platform profiles that is grounded on the strategic dimensions of value creation and value delivery architectures. We discover that mobile payment platforms could be delineated based on: (1) whether they are integrative or integratable on their value creation architecture; and (2) whether they have direct, indirect, or open access on their value delivery architecture. The preceding attributes of value creation architecture and value delivery architecture aided us in identifying six profiles associated with mobile payment platforms, which in turn led us to advance three competitive strategies that could be pursued by digital platforms in network economies.

Then, through a qualitative explorative case-study of a particular type of sports facility, the Private Non-Profit (PNP) sports hall, the consequence of implementing PM based on New Public Governance (NPG) with the aim of increasing utilisation as a strategic response to times of austerity is analysed. A central aim of NPG is in this case to increase collaboration between local actors aiming at increasing the utilisation of sports facilities. To what extent this is possible in times of austerity is assessed by analysing the strategic behaviour of the board, management and Voluntary Sports Organisations (VSOs). Nine persons in three different sports halls representing the management, the board and the largest VSO were interviewed in 2012 and again in 2014. The results indicate that austerity measures seem to cast a shadow on attempts of increasing collaboration via NPG in times of austerity. It was very difficult to increase levels of collaboration between local actors with the aim of increasing utilisation of the sports facility. Particular attention therefore needs to be directed towards how different actors can be motivated to increase collaboration.

This article reviews existing approaches to the study of urban climate politics, by way of asking what contribution Ulrich Beck’s theory of world risk society–and principles of methodological cosmopolitanism–make to such epochal conversations? Three main analytical frameworks stand out: low-carbon transition literature highlight generic processes of socio-technical ‘greening’ of urban infrastructures; urban policy mobility work documents growing intercity networks around climate and sustainability; and actor–network theory-informed takes on urban controversies engage the localized politics of specific city-based ‘riskscapes’. While each framework makes valuable contributions, this article suggests that all of them remain under-theorized from the point of view of the specific dynamics of local–global interdependencies in urban climate risk politics. In response, the article draws on Beck in outlining the contours of new urban–cosmopolitan risk communities. To this effect, empirical studies into large-scale East Asian and European port cities is used to illustrate how a shared transnational risk imaginary (e.g. of future sea-level rises) may help spur collective action and new forms of trans-boundary solidarity. Reflecting on such research practices, the article ends by pointing to the need for reworking methods of (multi-sited) ethnography and comparison as central parts of realizing Ulrich Beck’s cosmopolitan sociology in the domain of urban climate risks. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate risks; methodological cosmopolitanism; Ulrich Beck; urban politics; world risk society","Sea level; Social sciences; Intercity network; Low-carbon futures; Low-carbon transitions; methodological cosmopolitanism; Risk societies; Ulrich Beck; Urban infrastructure; urban politics; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026774676

The article examines Beck’s conceptualization of risk and discusses how he has clarified and further refined the concept since publishing Risk Society in 1986. The article shows, first, how Beck understands risk as an entity that is neither danger nor risk in the traditional sense but rather something in between, which he refers to as ‘man-made disasters’ and ‘new risks’. The discussion then addresses Beck’s position in relation to the ontological status of risk, which is an intermediate position between realism and constructivism. The non-calculability and non-insurability of the new risks are also examined. The article discusses what it means that the new risks are not visible and the significance of non-knowledge for how we understand them. Finally, the new conditions of existence for politics, states and individuals are outlined in the aftermath of Beck’s risk society theory.

We examined whether construction workers predominantly identify themselves in terms of their workgroup or in terms of the construction site. In addition, we examined the associations between social identity and safety climate, and how these constructs are associated with work-related accidents. The analyses were based on questionnaire responses from 478 construction workers from two large construction sites, and the methods involved structural equation modeling. Results showed that the workers identified themselves primarily with their workgroup, and to a lesser degree with the construction site. Social identity and safety climate were related both at the workgroup and construction site levels, meaning that social identity may be an antecedent for safety climate. The association between social identity and safety climate was stronger at the workgroup level than at the construction site level. Finally, safety climate at both levels was inversely associated with self-reported accidents, with the strongest association at the workgroup level.

At the conceptual level, the study offers a model that identifies the following five innovation gaps in Scandinavian rural tourism: (1) the portfolio gap, (2) the policy departmentalization gap, (3) the knowledge gap, (4) the change motivation gap, and (5) the resource interpretation gap. At the empirical level, the study shows that rural tourism has its basis in a dichotomy between authenticity and modernization. New and prospective customer groups, particularly from Germany, demand more diversified and higher quality rural tourism products than current groups, for example, in relation to outdoor opportunities, leisure festivals, and cultural activities. With rural assets, it is possible to expand the portfolio without compromising the rural image. Rural tourism enterprises and destinations remain slow movers in terms of innovation endeavours, and the study indicates that the discrepancies between potential customers’ service expectations and their spending patterns can partially explain this phenomenon. The merit of the innovation gap model is that this model identifies potential rebalancing actions at both enterprise and destination levels. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","customer demand; innovation capacity; innovation gaps; Rural tourism; Scandinavia","economic growth; innovation; modernization; rural economy; tourism economics; tourist destination; travel demand; Denmark; Germany; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012044276

However, scant research has examined visitors to those events, particularly in terms of their profile characteristics and expenditure patterns. Against this backdrop, this study aims to shed more light on the characteristics of visitors to such events and their spending patterns by using primary data from 1011 attendees to the German sailing event Warnemünder Woche held in Rostock in summer 2013. Insights offered by this research are important from both an economic and a marketing standpoint. Regarding the first point, the study delivers key evidence on visitors’ origin, primary motivation, and average spending, which constitute crucial input variables for future ex ante economic impact assessments of comparable events (e.g. Tall Ships’ Races and other sailing events hosted along the coast in Scandinavia and Baltic countries). Regarding the second, by providing a clear-cut picture of event visitors’ profile and spending patterns, this research offers a fertile agenda for further marketing inquiries and practical endeavors for Warnemünder Woche’s organizers and marketers. Accordingly, several cases for action are highlighted. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","attendees; Events; Germany; profiling; sailing; spending patterns; Warnemünder Woche","economic impact; marketing; public spending; tourism economics; tourism market; Germany; Mecklenburg-West Pomerania; Rostock",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011278203

Policies are promulgated to regulate the manufacturing, real-estate and financial industries as well as to tackle pollution. The influence of the economic restructuring can be best observed in the dynamics in throughput in China’s container port system. Containerization has enabled China to rise as a major global exporter of manufactured goods. The development of the pilot free-trade zones represents the initiatives that contribute to the second dimension of the “two-way opening up policy”. Port integration is not a new phenomenon. In the early period, governmental regulation, spatial planning guidance, shoreline-resource-complementarities harmonization and port-function optimization were the driving forces behind port integration. Port integration will continue to exhibit strong growth and market-driven modes will likely dominate the process.

China’s accession into the World Trade Organization in 2001 directly led to a surge in demand for sea-borne transportation. Water-borne transportation originated from the domestic activities of river- or ocean-going and fishing. China’s port industry has experienced dramatic changes since the implementation of Open Door Policy in 1978. The highly centralized governance system did not change until the 1980s. Port ownership was partially transferred from the central government to the local government. The domination of foreign shipping companies in China and the high profitability of the industry gave the Qing government incentives to develop a modern shipping company to take back control of domestic navigation. Chinese shipbuilding commenced in 1860 when the first modern steamship was delivered in Shanghai. Chinese shipyards can be divided into three types: large state-owned yards, large private enterprise or joint-venture yards, and other small-to-medium size yards. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Okan Duru; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139685635

Environmental factors, over which businesses have little control, profoundly influence the performance of the businesses and determine the success or failure of a particular business strategy. Before 1978, foreign trade only accounted for a small portion of national trade, because national policies deterred the entry of foreign capital. Foreign trade is the primary driver of shipping demand, and thus demand for cargo handling at terminals. The reform of the port industry was carried out to increase the competitiveness of the industry, in terms of efficiency and capacity. The regulations opened up the possibility of sourcing funds from local government, foreign investors and directly through commercial bank loans, in addition to the central government. Port governance reform accelerated the addition of port infrastructure and terminal capacity. The institutional change brought about greater efficiency than direct physical investment in ports. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Okan Duru; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85139671561

Increasing the level of standardization of such tools also seems difficult to achieve, because the contexts surrounding the focal organizations differ considerably. Therefore, what we need is a systematic, interdisciplinary assessment of how to measure and control sustainability, so that we can establish an essential definition and up-to-date picture of the field. Measuring and Controlling Sustainability attempts to provide such an assessment in 17 chapters, organized into four main topic sections: (a) organizations and social value creation: concepts, responsibilities, and barriers; (b) accounting, measurement, performance, and diffusion of social value; (c) practical and managerial insights from real-life cases; and (d) choices, incentives, guidance, and ethics.

VSOs have a democratic decision-making structure, where members decide at the annual general assembly who is elected as board members.

Although inter-subgroup bias may disrupt team communication and collaboration, distinct knowledge and perspective from different subgroups are potential resource to group brainstorming and team coordination. Drawing on the Categorization- Elaboration Model (CEM), this study investigates the contingent effects of team intellectual capital and team feedback seeking tendency on the relationship between social dominance-based faultlines and team performance in the context of crowdsourcing tournament. We collected real objective data about 208 teams from one of the biggest crowdsourcing platforms, Kaggle.com. We find that social dominance- based faultlines positively affect team performance for teams with low intellectual capital and high feedback seeking tendency; by contrast, these faultlines negatively affect team performance for teams with high intellectual capital and low feedback seeking tendency. Academic and practical implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The answer is yes under certain conditions. Using a novel dataset of matched entrepreneurs and employees in Belgium, we show that: (i) on average, entrepreneurs returning to the labour market after a business failure are penalized, but this effect is most pronounced for those coming from the higher echelons of the wage distribution, and absent for those who earned relatively little before entering self-employment. (ii) the penalty is only present for entrepreneurs who fail quickly: entrepreneurs returning to the labour market after 5 or more years do not get penalized. (iii) entrepreneurs who fail fast and move to a new employer limit the wage penalty by changing industry compared to the industry they were venturing in.

We present theoretical arguments implying that the strength of ties is more important for inventive quality, and the size of a network is more important for inventive quantity. We base our analysis on original survey data obtained from 1,204 inventors listed on European patent applications of companies active in clean technology, nanotechnology, and mechanical engineering. The survey data were matched with register information covering 15,168 patent applications filed at the European Patent Office. We find that the size of the network and the strength of the ties are positively related to invention quantity and quality. After instrumenting the endogenous network variables, we find that not considering endogeneity leads to an overestimation of the effect of the network size and an underestimation of the effect of the strength of the network ties. Additionally, after instrumenting the endogenous variables, we find that whereas the size of a network is equally important for invention quantity and quality, the strength of network ties is considerably more important (times 1.6) for quality than for quantity. © 2018 Academy of Management.

This Handbook brings together scholars from different parts of the world, representing various disciplines and intellectual traditions. It covers the development of economic thought and practices from antiquity to neoliberalism, and it provides insight into the economic-theological teachings of major religious movements. The list of contributors combines well-established scholars and younger academic talents. The chapters in this Handbook cover a wide array of conceptual, historical, theoretical and methodological issues and perspectives, such as the economic meaning of theological concepts (e.g. providence and faith); the theological underpinnings of economic concepts (e.g. credit and property); the religious significance of socio-economic practices in various organizational fields (e.g. accounting and work); and finally the genealogy of the theological-economic interface in Judaism, Christianity, Islam and in the discipline of economics itself (e.g. Marx, Keynes and Hayek).

Their ability to deliver relevant research and education at the highest level have an impact on growth and progress in society, and governments attempt to control and govern the development of the universities. It is no longer left to the individual researcher or the institution to determine the role of the university. Universities have traditionally had a special role in society with a high degree of autonomy and independence. They have been described as a self-governing Republic of Science and their internal organization is characterized as “academic tribes”. However, universities can also be viewed as institutions with somewhat similar characteristics as other public institutions with highly professionalized staff. Governing the Reformed University is a coherent volume based on a unique data set. The aim of the book is to quantitatively and qualitatively understand and explain how reforms and management instruments are implemented and how it influences different levels of the organization from the top management level to the employees within universities. It contributes to the knowledge of reform and reform impact in higher education. It also adds to our understanding of management and governance at universities and through which mechanisms management works at universities.

Performance contracts were introduced, and they were first billed as being about “liberation management” and supporting performance management known within New Public Management (NPM). The big lure of NPM was always that public organizations would be set free, manage their own affairs, and compete in a marketplace for customers and resources. Universities seem to have lost that special ingredient that sets them apart from all other types of organizations delivering public services. Many of the researchers in the empirical material were ignorant of the possibilities of getting rewarded by the universities for their performance.

Attempts to reform public institutions have been going on for several decades, starting with the wave of New Public Management (NPM) reforms in the 1980s and 1990s. Reforms of universities especially target the internal organization of universities and try changing them into an instrument in pursuit of efficiency, economic development, and, more broadly, public value creation. The formalization of universities into more “normal” public sector organizations alongside hospitals, schools, police force, etc. has occurred over a long period. To protect academic freedom and secure the legitimacy of Academia, the universities were highly self-governed under the Humboldt model. Performance measurement and management is perhaps the strongest trend that came out of the NPM reform agenda, and one which is likely to survive. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book. © 2020 Taylor and Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135969894

In relation to this, the importance and potential of co-creating unique and personally meaningful experiences have been emphasised. Such experience co-creation is particularly relevant in tourism because production and consumption is inseparable and because tourists often seek to create their own experiences that fulfil their personal expectations and desires. In this chapter, we argue that because tourist experiences are experiences of place, place experience co-creation is central to value creation in tourism. Adding place to the co-creation discussion results in new and interesting perspectives. From the place experience perspective, the extent of co-creation in tourism depends on the degree to which place is controlled by tourism companies or co-created with tourists. This chapter uses this argument to build a model of tourism place experience co-creation. The role and potential of place co-creation is illustrated in a comparative case study of tourism businesses that shows how different business strategies can facilitate place experience co-creation. The findings suggest that place experience co-creation has wide-ranging potential in tourism and that it may ultimately lead not only to personal and meaningful tourist experiences but also to new business strategies, business models, and internal and external business brands. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125461311

Religions have historically encouraged followers to seek all of these goals, and have often suggested that they are linked not only with each other but also with the gaining of divine favour. The Abrahamic religions display related but not identical attitudes towards material prosperity. The medieval Roman Church established itself as a political and economic entity at one remove from royalty, and by 1100 the papacy probably owned up to a third of the arable land in Western Europe. Prosperity theology parallels classical Pentecostalism in its emphasis on the second baptism of the Spirit and charismatic gifts, but is distinctive in the degree to which it focuses on divine healing and material prosperity.

Executive coaching has since its inception been utilized not only to enhance an executive’s performance to support broader organizational goals but for the explicit aim of increasing self-awareness and self-management as a leader. Executive coaching at the senior leadership level has often been referred to as ‘developmental’ or ‘transformational’ coaching. Locke and Latham’s foundational work in goal setting is a useful tool for building meaning in executive coaching. Many different strengths assessments and tools are utilized in coaching contexts.

Going beyond the typical focus on R&D, the focus of this article is on engaging those employees who are active in 'productive' activities in innovation. This article explores how a firm can create an environment in which those employees can build on their local needs and knowledge to learn and innovate through a process of experimentation and problem solving during 'on-the-job' activities. I draw on innovation, creativity and organisational climate research to explore the determinants and effects of such innovative behaviour. I develop a theoretical framework of how organisational practices affect employees' willingness and ability to experiment - a behavioural integral to innovation. I furthermore argue that the relationship between such 'climate for innovation' and the ultimate performance is inverse U-shaped. The framework implies that managers can turn the entire organisation into an innovation lab but they need to balance the tension between productive and innovative practices.

Informed by life course theory, we argue that depending on duration and timing, human capital can depreciate during work interruptions (such as unemployment or parental leave) but also be restored by re-entering and staying in the job market. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we analyse the educational and occupational life courses of individuals who have started a business. We investigate whether there are patterns in the biographies of these individuals. Exploratory analysis reveals that seven types of founders can be differentiated. In this sample, cluster 1 appeared to be most successful in terms of early-stage firm survival. Sequence analysis has proved to be a valuable method to improve the efficiency of research on the life courses of business founders. This study invites future research to take a deeper look at life-course-based factors of business activity and success.

Differences in organisation, structure and teaching methods between both universities could be identified, as well as similar developments concerning entrepreneurship education in general. Both universities do research in the field of entrepreneurship, offer related programmes for bachelor and master students and focus the study programmes on practical experiences, experimental teaching and the involvement of guest lecturers. In addition to that, they offer cross-faculty electives and extra-curricular activities to connect students from different faculties and provide the opportunity to network with investors, support organisations and participate in a business plan competition.

The paper identifies how, in particular, three interrelated routines appear to trigger moments of recursive learning and employee-driven innovation (EDI) among employees. These routines are: 1) an organisational form of global communities of practice; 2) a 'cookbook' representing a set of guidelines to ensure a common approach to the sharing of best practices; 3) a set of governance procedures to support continual improvements. They do so by allowing employees to: a) collectively engage in and work towards a common purpose; b) identify, document and share knowledge about the problems and solutions they encounter in regard to their work; c) continually improve work practices. The findings contribute to an understanding of how organisational structuring of EDI can be developed and managed, and highlight the importance of deliberately organising routines, spaces and moments to foster such dynamics.

Despite a growing interest in co-design and the effects of engaging citizens (or users) in public service innovation, far too little attention has been paid to the potential influence and learning dynamics of: 1) inclusion of user perspectives; 2) of using co-design approaches on employees' practice, learning, and innovation. Through the theoretical lens of 'boundary encounters', this article offers a learning perspective on the influence of co-design approaches on employee-driven innovation. It reports the findings from an exploratory case study in a prison context. The analysis shows that including user perspectives creates strange perspectives on familiar routines, and that reflective and transformative learning dynamics emerge in sequences of experience prototypes and storytelling. It is argued that co-design approaches hold potential for employees to reframe meaning and innovate practice, and can enhance individual and organisational learning.

Universities seek to deal with this situation by academic engagement, hereby providing external research support for businesses. Relying on the market segmentation approach, promoting beneficial exchange relations between academia and businesses enables the integration of both perspectives and may contribute to solving current challenges. Transferring the segmentation approach and the customer benefit perspective to university-business collaboration (UBC), this paper develops a multi-step segmentation framework aimed at identifying research customer segments in technical textile industries in Western Europe.

Although aspects of, for example, stakeholder inclusion and power are conceptualized in the literature, these issues remain challenging in practice. Therefore, the interest in understanding the emerging processes of collaborative governance is growing. This chapter contributes to theorizing discursive aspects of such processes by conceptualizing and exploring the meaning negotiations through which collaborative governance designs emerge and change. The findings of a case study of local governments’ efforts to innovate quality management in education through collaborative governance suggest that such form of governance is continually negotiated in communication during both design and implementation phases. Through the meaning negotiations of local designs, discursive tensions and resistance generate changes in the organizing. The chapter shows that a discursive approach offers concepts valuable for refining the understanding of the emergence of collaborative governance in practice, and proposes approaching this process as organizing accomplished through and complicated by endemic meaning negotiations and change. © Peter Lang AG 2018.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115132810

Whereas sustainability addresses decision making for the management of human activities on the Earth system with derived consequences to welfare, resilience may be seen to address decision making for the management the Earth system and human activities on the functionalities of social institutions and activities that facilitate welfare. It is evident that there is a strong coupling between sustainability and resilience, and that the two terms ultimately express the same mechanisms from two different perspectives. The present chapter addresses resilience and sustainability, and their interdependencies, in the context of providing decision support for societal developments. Based on earlier works of the author, capacities of human and natural systems are introduced and modeled probabilistically as functions of decisions affecting societal developments. It is shown that resilience and sustainability of engineered systems may be approached in the exact same manner by introducing resilience and sustainability failures as the events that one or more capacities of considered systems are exhausted. If resilience of the global Earth systems is considered in the long term perspective, resilience failure is equivalent to sustainability failure. Moreover, resilience of engineered systems at smaller scales necessitate resilience (or sustainability) at global scale. Tradeoffs between resilience and sustainability exist and must be accounted for when deciding how resilient engineered systems and sustainable societal developments should be. More research on these tradeoffs must be achieved in the nearer future to facilitate timely and informed societal decision making. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Paolo Gardoni.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108485195

In an explorative ethnographic study, comprising interviews and participant observation, of telemedicine-based interaction between community nurses and specialized hospital nurses, we show how the ‘tele-ulcer' system becomes a site for professional development for community nurses, although a hierarchization of professional knowledge also takes place. Furthermore, extensive articulation work is necessary to make the tele-ulcer system work. We illuminate how contradictory divisions of responsibility may result from the design of the sociotechnical system, leaving professionals to deal with risks and insecurity. © 2018.

As a consequence, professional competence becomes increasingly a matter of how the individual care worker manage to coordinate the different temporal perspectives that are simultaneously at play within the nursing home.

The paper then unfolds the great expectations tied to welfare technologies in general, and wash-and-dry toilets specifically. Turning to differentiated examples of situated uses of the toilets, the complexity of making the toilets work within the context of professional eldercare is illustrated. Some of the uses of the toilets in care work are in concordance with policy expectations. Other uses demonstrate difficulties in satisfying the great expectations and call for a more complex understanding of what it takes to achieve dignified, technologically assisted care without silencing the skills and professionalism of care workers. © 2018.

Design/methodology/approach: Events and experiences related to interventions in a municipal center are presented. The study is embedded in critical diversity research and applies engaged ethnographic methods. Findings: The researcher reflects on how interventions designed to challenge the status quo faced difficulties while considering the impact of the research entry point, efforts to mobilize organizational members in favor of a diversity agenda and the micro-politics of doing intervention-based research. Practical implications: The study reflects on how “useful” research with an allegedly emancipatory agenda might not be considered favorable to neither majority nor minority employees. The notion of affectivity is applied to deal with the organizational members’ multi-voiced response to the change efforts, as well as how the researcher’s position as researcher-change agent critically shaped the fieldwork experiences and their interpretation. Originality/value: Few critical diversity scholars engage with practitioners to produce “useful” research with practical implications. In doing so, this paper contributes to critical diversity methods by exploring why presumably emancipatory initiatives apparently did not succeed, despite organizational goodwill. This involves questioning the implied assumption of the inherent “good” of emancipation, as well as notions of “useful research.” © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Affect; Critical diversity; Intervention-based ethnography; Micro-politics; Researcher and change agent; Useful research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106452471

We then propose a number of new approaches to product family modeling, which utilizes data from other systems such as ERP and PDM, which enables a more fact-based modeling process. Furthermore, the proposed approach enables feedback loops into the product family model, which is possible due to advances in connectivity (IOT applications).

The three dimensions are: environmental, social, and economic. The chapter utilizes the TBL perspective, considering its three dimensions, in order to measure improvements in sustainability performance. It examines both environmental and social practices as suggested by S. Seuring and M. Muller's definition of sustainable operations. The chapter considers the firm's operational performance as a proxy of the economic dimension. It examines the impact of internal social and environmental practices on environmental, social, and operational performance. The impact of environmental practices on operational performance is mediated by the environmental and social performance achieved. This suggests that being a sustainable company contributes to achieve operational improvements. Environmental sustainability refers to the use of energy and other resources and the footprint companies leave behind as a result of their operations. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Adam Lindgreen, Christine Vallaster, Shumaila Yousafzai and Bernhard Hirsch; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087799946

Authentic leadership, however, depends upon the ability to draw a distinction between the authentic and inauthentic leader. This paper uses Deleuze’s discussion of Platonism as a point of departure for critically scrutinizing the problem of authenticating the leader—drawing a distinction between authentic and inauthentic leaders. This will be done through a reading of Bill George’s book Authentic Leadership. Informed by Deleuze’s inverted Platonism, the paper challenges the practice by which authentic leaders are distinguished from inauthentic leaders. In conclusion, the paper suggests that an adequate concept of authentic leadership should consider how ethics can occur when the authentic leader is able to critically reflect his or her own value-commitments. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Authentic leadership; Deleuze; Enron; Ethics; Leadership; Plato",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082360200

In turn, the emphasis on connected crises in both natural and social systems has attracted more activists to the Climate Justice movement and created a common cause between activists from the Global South and North. In the absence of a pervasive narrative of transnational or socialist economic planning to prevent catastrophic climate change, these activists have been eager to engage with advanced knowledge and ideas on political and economic structures that diminish risks and allow for new climate agency. This book breaks new ground by investigating what kind of economy the Climate Justice movement is calling for us to build and how the struggle for economic change has unfolded so far. Examining ecological debt, just transition, indigenous ecologies, social ecology, community economies and divestment among other topics, the authors provide a critical assessment and a common ground for future debate on economic innovation via social mobilization. Taking a transdisciplinary approach that synthesizes political economy, history, theory and ethnography, this volume will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate justice, environmental politics and policy, environmental economics and sustainable development. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Stefan Gaarsmand Jacobsen; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080378774

This introduces a different competitive environment than the food industry has traditionally experienced. A possible solution to the change in customer demand is to apply the business strategy, mass customization, which enables customized products at prices near that of mass-produced products. Although mass customization has been utilized in several different industries, the food industry has not yet seen this business strategy widely adopted. This paper presents a literature review, which only reveals few works within mass customization in the food industry. The limited literature covers food manufacturing processes, product configuration, and supply chain. To examine the potentials and challenges of mass customization in the food industry, a case study of a food manufacturer is conducted. It becomes evident that the case company has challenges with mastering the capabilities required to achieve mass customization. The challenges identified in this study are (1) no product solution space development, (2) limited knowledge of raw material, (3) manual equipment adjustment, (4) dedicated software and hardware solutions, and (5) limited choice navigation. In light of the listed challenges and the limited literature in the field, it is clear that more research is imperative in order to enable mass customization in the food industry. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","Case study; Food industry; Literature study; Mass customization",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079325064

Supply-chain management is very important in the petroleum industry. Few continents have petroleum reserves, hence there is a need for efficient methods of managing the sourcing, storage and distribution processes across the globe. There have been major improvements in safety management practices, during extraction and processing, in transit, and in situ distribution. Bulk storage of petroleum plays a crucial role across the world as it eases distribution hassles and can act as emergency reserves in the event of disruptions in the supply chain. However, lighter fractions of petroleum have a tendency to evaporate during storage as they are highly volatile. Although there are mechanisms such as floating roofs that have been invented to effectively reduce evaporative losses of light petroleum fractions, the percentage of losses are still high, particularly in some climatic conditions. On average, floating roofs allow leeway for loss tolerances of +/- 0.2% of throughput. Unleaded petrol tanks record significant losses beyond the acceptable tolerances. The Botswana climate is semi-arid, which makes bulk oil storage facility manager cautious about prevailing conditions at their storage reserves.

The study uses a unique dataset, which includes 14,513 SMEs across several sectors in 34 countries. The results show that firms using the Internet as a means to provide information about the firm exhibit a higher degree of internationalisation, while using the Internet to facilitate transactions was found to have a positive impact on the ratio of foreign sales to the total sales; however, these foreign sales are likely to be concentrated in less regions/markets. Furthermore, perceived export barriers were found to be a significant moderator of the effects of e-commerce usage on international intensity and international diversification.

Complex problem solving requires members to engage in a number of complicated collaborative processes to generate solutions. This chapter illustrates how the Macrocognition in Teams model, developed to guide research on these processes, can be utilized to propose how intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) could be developed to train collaborative problem solving. Metacognitive prompting, based upon macrocognitive processes, was offered as an intervention to scaffold learning these complex processes. Our objective is to provide a theoretically grounded approach for linking intelligent tutoring research and development with team cognition. In this way, team members are more likely to learn how to identify and integrate relevant knowledge, as well as plan, monitor, and reflect on their problem-solving performance as it evolves. We argue that ITSs that utilize metacognitive prompting that promotes team planning during the preparation stage, team knowledge building during the execution stage, and team reflexivity and team knowledge sharing interventions during the reflection stage can improve collaborative problem solving. © Olivia B.

Based on literature, there are various challenges reported on managing different phases of PCS projects. Different tools and solutions have been suggested and applied for solving these challenges especially at the level of the project management process. Moreover, various software project management methods are used, in order to get high quality PCS, such as Rational Unified Process (RUP). The changes from Plan-driven methodologies towards a pure agile way of working is a challenge that comes with both benefits and risks. In this paper, first we will investigate about the PCS projects using the RUP method and then we will discuss PCS projects cases managed and launch using Agile principles. We use a comparative qualitative explanatory case study method on multiple data sources: documentation, workshops and participant observation.

These developers face challenges in developing and implementing PCS as the main enabler of mass customization. Main difficulties occur in knowledge management (KM) stage for domain experts and the configuration team as the internal stakeholders or users. Design Thinking (DT) is a human-centered approach that includes a wide perspective of stakeholders and aims at enhancing human experience and solving complicated problems. Therefore, it can be used to solve this challenge of KM in configuration projects which is mainly related to communication within the organization by following a systematic, iterative design approach. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to review the literature of DT to gain deeper understanding of its characteristics, processes and components. Secondly, to apply the findings from literature regarding DT to the KM stage in PCS. The authors' ultimate goal is to outline what the contribution of DT to PCS can be and discuss its importance in promoting the collaboration and communication of knowledge within the organization. © IEOM Society International.","Design thinking; Internal stakeholders; Knowledge management; Product configuration system",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066936234

Among several ways to address this issue is the development of platforms. Platforms, for instance, coupled with the use of reconfigurable manufacturing systems, can potentially enable manufacturers to deal with a more dynamic market, an increase in variation and decrease in product lifecycle. The development of these platforms and systems is often difficult to begin and even more so to finish. This paper presents a method for developing and codeveloping product and production system platforms, using concepts from the field of software architecture development. Development and implementation of the method were carried out through case studies in two Danish companies. The method is an iterative approach consisting of four loops with four steps each.

Given that CSR initiatives increasingly are carried out in collaboration with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), business NGO (Bus NGO) partnerships are becoming an increasingly important instrument in driving forward the sustainable development agenda. The aim of this chapter is to explore motivations to partner, the value-added of Bus NGO partnerships as well as what is enabling and impeding the realization of this value. An analytical model is developed based on contributions from partnership literature (Austin, 2000, 2007; Austin & Seitanidi, 2012a, 2012b; Seitanidi & Ryan, 2007) and the resourced-based view. This has resulted in a process model with the following three phases: (1) formation and motivation; (2) implementation and execution; and (3) outcomes and challenges. The empirical part of the chapter focuses on three specific partnerships in Kenya. Kenya is one of the most prosperous and politically stable states in Africa, with high growth rates making it an attractive launch pad for businesses to enter partnerships with NGOs. The partnerships studied were all pilots still flirting with this new form of collaboration modality and struggling themselves to clearly define the valueadded. Partnerships are still experimental efforts involving a steep learning curve, and showing signs that they have to evolve further as well as innovate in order to produce the expected benefits. All three partners referred to learning as one of the most important intangibles. Business and NGOs had both different and overlapping motivations that made them propel into cross-sector alliances. The partnerships have to be configured to satisfy a variety of different motivations, resulting in complex stakeholder management. For the NGOs, it is about designing new development models, due to an instrumental need of resource enhancement and idealistic need to deliver more sustainable and efficient solutions. The analysis shows clear signs of NGOs beginning to realize the importance of classical business skills, such as management, marketing, and technical systems that companies can provide. Looking at the business, the partnership fit right into the wider strategic sustainability “umbrella” of the corporation, notably the employees are central stakeholders. It is argued that a business’s approach to CSR and perception of its own responsibilities need to evolve to higher levels according to Austin’s Collaboration Continuum to produce valuable synergies in a partnership with an NGO (Austin, 2000). Finally, the analysis shows a Bandwagon effect throughout the sectors, where the reason to form a partnership is because everybody else is doing it, and both NGOs and businesses do not want to miss out on potential benefits. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Capabilities; Collaboration; CSR; Learning; Sustainability; Value-added",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065588352

The analysis of individual middle manager practices of a global mindset and associated organizational practices, as observed from a middle manager strategy implementation perspective, is condensed into four core aspects of individual-organizational practice that enables the enactment of global mindset: inclusive strategy co-creation, inter-actional synergy, imagined community building, and performance flexibility.

The consequence is that we know very little about the ways aesthetic affects ethical considerations among guests and travellers. A more comprehensive reconciliation of the ethical and aesthetic dimensions may lead to the recognition that a stronger emphasis on aesthetics can enhance the guest’s experience of sustainable tourism within a responsible experience economy.

Agents preferences are described by subsets of goods that provides the agent with service. As such, demands are binary, and it is further assumed that agents prefer a low cost share, but other differences in their individual preferences are irrelevant, making demand fully inelastic. The model captures central aspects of several classes of practical problems and therefore has many potential applications.

Using data collected by academics and international organisations (e.g. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, OECD, UNDP), Qatar, U.A.E., Jordan in the Middle East, and Morocco in North Africa, emerge as the countries most likely to have the potential to develop a strong cadre of successful entrepreneurs. All four countries have very high youth population percentages, but MENA also has the world’s highest unemployment rates. E.g. in Morocco 49% of youths aged 15–24 are not employed or in school (NEET); in Jordan, more than half the entire population is &gt;25 years of age and 25% of these youths are unemployed. In Qatar and U.A.E., population demographics are similar, but there’s greater likelihood their governments and/or foreign direct investment will provide needed resources. While economic development contributes to overall success, the ineffective and outmoded public education systems that currently exist throughout MENA not only prevent the spread of entrepreneurism, but also increase overhead for existing employers.

Advanced IT systems have enhanced inventory and demand visibility and facilitated communications with global partners and customers, while transportation technologies have improved the speed and efficiency necessary to transport goods globally. However, dramatic changes in both of these areas are on the horizon. The emergence of new technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT) will force the next big wave of changes in global supply chains. While some of these technologies have been adopted by individual firms, many questions remain concerning how these technologies will drive new supply chain policies, business models, and regulations in the future. To illustrate, while technologies such as autonomous vehicles and IoT facilitate supply chain efficiency and transparency, they also increase the risk of compromising data security. In this chapter, we offer a brief overview of each of these emerging technologies and summarize the impact on the supply chain.

The framework suggests that new knowledge is the basis of innovation and leveraging knowledge from the supply-network is a key element along with absorptive-capacity and R&D-investment in creating new knowledge. New knowledge, however, must be exploited to create innovative new products and successfully commercialized. Suppliers can play an important role in ensuring successful exploitation of new knowledge. We posit that innovation-fostering-practices mediate the exploitation of new knowledge into superior innovation-performance. Thus, the proposed conceptual-framework incorporates the exploration and exploitation-aspects of innovation. Since contextual-differences can play a major role in the efficacy of these innovation-practices, our conceptual-framework might not fit complex project-environments in its entirety. To better understand the contextual-influences in complex projects, we evaluate the applicability of theoretical arguments from repetitive-manufacturing literature and our conceptual-framework to complex project-environments.

A conceptual model was developed and subsequently two major hypotheses were formulated. Linear regression was performed using SPSS software 22.0 to tests the developed hypotheses. Supply chain innovation is unfolded through the components of business processes, networks structure and technology. Data reveals that supply chain innovation does pay off in terms of improved market and operational performance. The chapter also reveals that the strongest relationship is obtained with supply chain innovation and operational performance. Market performance may be influenced by a number of different factors beyond supply chain innovation.

The authors draw on untapped potential of the classical garbage can model (GCM), and extend it to analyze how restrictions on project participation influence differentiation and integration of organizational members’ knowledge and consequently organizational efficiency in solving the diverse, changing problems from an uncertain task environment. To isolate the effects of problem or knowledge diversity and experiential learning, the authors designed three simulation experiments to identify the most efficient task allocation structure in conditions of (1) knowledge homogeneity, (2) knowledge heterogeneity, and (3) experiential learning. The authors find that free project participation is superior when the members’ knowledge and the problems they solve are homogenous. When problems and knowledge are heterogeneous, the design requirement is on matching specialists to problem types. Finally, the authors found that experiential learning creates a dynamic problem where the double duty of adapting the members’ specialization and matching the specialists to problem types is best solved by a hierarchic structure (if problems are challenging). Underlying the efficiency of the hierarchical structure is an adaptive role of specialized members in organizational learning and problem solving: their narrow but deep knowledge helps the organization to adapt the knowledge of its members while efficiently dealing with the problems at hand. This happens because highly specialized members reduce the necessary scope of knowledge and learning for other members during a certain period of time.

This study examines key design issues faced by a bilateral broker collaborative community at the point of its formation: (1) whether a critical mass of members is required for community survival, (2) the nature of the match between member skills and community challenges, and (3) how the mix of member skills needs to be adjusted over time to sustain community growth. Findings from our agent-based simulation study indicate that, contrary to suggestions in the literature, a critical mass of members is not necessary for a bilateral broker community to survive early on. The literature also suggests that there should be a match between the skill levels of community members and the skill requirements of the challenges that the community must solve in order for it to grow. We find that a match between skill levels and challenge requirements is necessary but not sufficient: the skill levels of community members must significantly exceed the skill requirements of the challenges. Lastly, we find that the appropriate amount of heterogeneity in member skills is contingent on several factors associated with how the community adapts over time. Implications of these findings for the theory and practice of organization design are discussed. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Agent-based simulation; Collaborative communities; Community formation; Hybrid organizations; Organization design; Organizational form",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064455019

Both types of heterogeneity can be persistent, and are interdependent, although they have typically been studied separately. The authors propose a simple formal framework – the “aggregation function framework” – that aligns organization design thinking with the emphasis on performance heterogeneity among firms that is characteristic of the strategy field. This framework allows for a more precise identification of how exactly organization design may contribute to persistent performance differences, and therefore what exactly are the assumptions that strategy and organization design scholars need to be attentive to. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Aggregation function; Competitive heterogeneity; Design heterogeneity; Design inertia; Persistent performance differences; Strategic organization design",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064451128

The findings, in close dialog with different threads in the transparency literature, unveil three crucial dimensions in which transparency regimes are likely to trigger unintended consequences: first, organizations have to cope with the tension between the disclosure of internal information on the one hand, and the need to appear consistent in public on the other. Second, transparency strategies can, however, turn into surveillance and trigger new forms of data ordering, sorting, and aggregating practices. Third, disclosure practices create and undermine complex hierarchies and power relations for organizational members. The comparison of the cases demonstrates that it is crucial to observe the practical implications and multiple trajectories of transparency practices. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Authority; Comparative case study; Consistency; Organization studies; Surveillance; Transparency",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064230638

This is an edited book about what we and our co-contributors believe to be a topical and highly important issue. We also realize that this is an issue with political overtones that may cause divides and heated debates. Despite several global warnings and calls for action with respect to becoming more sustainable, disagreement and even resistance remains towards the call for action towards more sustainability and the urgency for action. The dissent has moved from outward rejection of any climate change happening, to a discussion regarding the impact of this change on society (Lomborg, 2010). Currently, the debate revolves around whether we understand how and to what extent the current rate of natural resource exploitation affects global climatic conditions, how much and at what rate it will affect us and which route is the most promising to follow in order to become (more) sustainable. Take the case of the Trump administration, which repeatedly has expressed skepticism towards climate change and has withdrawn the United States from the UN climate negotiations. Consequently, the US presidential administration has removed sustainability from the agenda of political aims for the United States and is currently considering rolling back the greenhouse gas emission policies that were put into action by the former president, Barack Obama. Meanwhile, the depletion of resources and the unintended consequences of unlimited growth in production and consumption are increasingly recognized in other parts of the United States and by stakeholders in other societies in-and outside the United States. © The Author(s) 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063547064

This builds on the recognition, that companies must also take sustainability issues into account in order to ensure long-term success and survival (Hart, 2005; Starik, Kanashiro, & Collins, 2017). Thus, in a sustainable business context, strategy and management research builds on more general insights from these disciplines but seeks to apply it in the context of sustainability. Sustainable operations provide an interesting context for exploring further the nature of strategizing. However, concepts and insights emanating from a sustainability focus may also provide important insights to the strategy and management disciplines. Research on the triple bottom line is an influential point of reference for strategizers as well as for strategic research linking to the SOM agenda (Lee, 2004). Another important conversation relates to the crucial link between research on strategic innovation and blueprinting sustainable operation systems with a strategic impact on company identity and operations. Research on strategic innovation and disruption may find disruptive operations management designs not only useful as research areas but they also have the potential to provide insights that fundamentally challenge existing conceptualizations. Understanding the meaning of market disruption as opposed to market discovery, discussed among entrepreneurs and new business venturists, are anchor points. © The Author(s) 2019.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063540788

These factors, which demand a high degree of safety and reliability, put special emphasis on maintenance. A brief review of research areas relevant to marine maintenance is given. The use of modern high-speed computers in maintenance related engineering is discussed. Examples of computer applications in operation and maintenance management of large technical systems are given. The need for development of new computer based methods for visual definition and modelling of complex marine installations as a tool for obtaining a better overview and understanding during operation and maintenance activities is stated. The basics of a new and simple computer graphics approach for interactive creation and modification of physically oriented system models is presented. The method applies interactive definition of plane system figures situated in general planes in three-dimensional space. Two- and three-dimensional viewing, zooming and panning are used. A concept for hierarchical and parallel system figure definition by use of an absolute or a relative definition mode is described. The method will act as a low cost alternative or supplement to large scale CAD models-primarily suitable for the needs of operation and maintenance. Examples of practical applications of the modelling technique are shown. The possibilities of using the described method in combination with computerized maintenance management systems, reliability calculations and other engineering applications are discussed. © 1991 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063498619

A case study is conducted to investigate the financial loss due to poor data quality in products sold through a not-maintained PCS. We calculated the financial loss by comparing the quotations generated by the not-maintained PCS and the quotations for the same product when the PCS was updated. The results indicate that the company has been selling the products with a miscalculated 20% lower cost than the actual one. Comparing this financial loss to the cost required to keep the PCS up-to-date, we show that the former is significantly higher than the latter. The research concludes that the realized success and benefits of utilizing a PCS are related to its maintenance and data quality. © 2017 IJIEM Journal.","Benefits of product configuration systems; case study; Challenges of product configuration systems; Cost calculation accuracy; Izazovi sistema za konfigurisanje proizvoda; Preciznost izračunavanja troškova; Prednosti sistema za konfigurisanje proizvoda; Product configuration system; Sistem za konfigurisanje proizvoda; Studija slučaja",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063198019

The research process focused on a merger between the citizen service center and the local library services in a Danish municipality of some 60,000 inhabitants. Staff members were urged to participate in working groups to discuss the reorganisation as such and their future tasks; however, disaffection and concerns about job security gave rise to serious problems between staff and leaders, and no constructive dialogue was established to deal with the issues. Employees' failure to speak up and address their concerns was alleged by management to be the stumbling block to further action, and thus management ignored potential system failures. This position is based on an understanding that 'talking about others' creates a negative spiral of gossiping and distortion of facts. A management perspective that emphasized assertive action thus exacerbated staff frustrations and prevented the management team from acknowledging the true problems facing the organisation. © 2018, Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH und Co.","Basic assumptions; Negative capability; Organisational change; Organisational silence; System psychodynamic approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063134924

Based on a typology of learning effects distinguishing between substantive knowledge, skill-building, and affective learning, the chapter analyses to what extent negotiation simulations generates student learning. The student cohorts are comprised of full-time university students (B.Sc. and M.Sc.) and professionals/public managers, who study part-time at the university (Professional Master of Public Management/Governance), as well as a cohort of selected high school students (Academy for Particularly Talented High School Students). The empirical data are based on quantitative data on substantive knowledge and qualitative data on the students’ experience of the negotiation simulations, as well as quantitative data on satisfaction levels via final course evaluations. The analysis reveals that while negotiation simulations undoubtedly stimulate students’ engagement and motivation and – in the students’ own perception – learning, measurable learning effects are more dubious. As opposed to the students’ own very positive statements about learning effects of negotiation simulations, assessable learning effects are harder to catch. There are some effects, but also important biases, as simulations tend to twist student’s perceptions of systems and processes disproportionately towards the issue, institution, or process in question during the particular simulation. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Affective learning; Cohort variance; Negotiation simulation; Skill-building; Substantive knowledge",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062450548

One of the earliest stylized facts of development economics is that low-income countries have large differences in output per worker across sectors, and movement of workers from low- to high-productivity sectors—structural transformation is a key driver of economic growth. Between 1950 and 2006, about half of the catch-up by developing countries—led by East Asia—to advanced economy productivity levels was due to rising productivity within manufacturing combined with structural transformation out of agriculture. Manufacturing has the capacity to employ large numbers of unskilled workers, is capable of large productivity gains through innovation, and entails tradeable products that permit economies of scale and specialization. But manufacturing in Africa, rather than leading growth, has typically been a lagging sector. In 2014, the average share of manufacturing in GDP in sub-Saharan Africa hovered around 10 per cent, unchanged from the 1970s, leading some observers to be pessimistic about Africa’s potential to catch the wave of sustained rapid growth and rising incomes. This book challenges that view. It argues that other activities sharing the characteristics of manufacturing–including tourism, ICT, and other services as well as food processing and horticulture—are beginning to play a role analogous to the role that manufacturing played in East Asia. This reflects not only changes in the global organization of industries since the early era of rapid East Asian growth, but also advantages unique to Africa. These ‘industries without smokestacks’ offer new opportunities for Africa to grow in coming decades. © United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER) 2018.","Africa; Economic growth; Industries without smokestacks; Manufacturing; Structural transformation",,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061699283

The results show that while board size and CEO duality significantly reduce risk taking behaviour of banks in Africa, extreme increase in board size increased risk taking behaviour of banks in Africa. Furthermore, the results reveal that the effect of bank level corporate governance structures on bank risk taking behaviour varies greatly across banks in different income brackets in Africa. This implies that the effects of corporate governance structures are shaped by contextual settings and effects. The policy implication from these findings are that bank regulators must institute corporate governance frameworks that help shape risk taking behaviour of banks which will enhance financial institution and sector soundness and stability. Also, bank ownership and management must be careful in the selection and implementation of bank corporate governance structures since not all the corporate governance structures induce the stability of banks given the income bracket a bank finds itself.

The digital infrastructure is highly developed. Automated decision-making is used on a growing scale within the areas of tax, environmental regulation and welfare. In some narrow and defined areas AI is integrated. This is not without issues, as challenges have emerged. One of these challenges is a loss of insight by the public authorities into the formation of decisions directed at citizens. This is mainly due to the outsourcing of the development and maintenance of the used technologies. As an example, the Minister of Taxation in 2014 reported to the national Parliament that the tax authorities had lost the insight into, as well as the control of, more than 200 systems used within this area of administration. Only the private suppliers of those systems possessed the knowledge necessary to describe and change the functionalities and digital decision-making. Therefore, to a certain extent power of decision-making had – unofficially – been outsourced to private suppliers. This unwanted side effect of digitalisation was, however, counteracted by the Danish Ombudsman in a recent case concerning one of the core Danish digital infrastructure components (the national NemID). In the summer of 2017 the Ombudsman stated that if private companies were to develop and operate such critical digital infrastructure, the explicit acceptance of the democratically legitimised parliament was required. This applies, even though a public procurement procedure has been performed legally correct per the Ombudsman. This paper will focus on this challenges caused by digitalisation of the public sector, the disruption of the allocation of administrative and legislative power in the national constitution. An argument will be developed through an examination of both recent literature as well as case-law from the Danish Parliamentary Ombudsman, ultimately resulting in a presentation of the current Danish solution to the challenges described above – which hopefully can inspire and serve as an input to a discussion of the relationship between private suppliers of digital services and public authorities at a European level. © 2018, Academic Conferences Limited.

This paper investigates how IT governance is conducted in local governments. Findings are presented from a case study of IT governance in a medium-sized Danish municipality. The following research question is posed: how does a municipality conduct IT governance within the school sector? This research question addresses the overall issue of local governments’ transition to e-government. According to a theoretical framework addressing the organisation of IT-governance, and the distribution of leadership in public organisations, the analysis focuses on how actors at different levels of the municipality conduct IT governance. The focus is both on the organisation of the IT department, as well on IT governance distributed at different levels throughout the organisation. The empirical data consists of qualitative interviews with leading managers within the municipality, and with the headmasters of two local schools, as well as shadowing of the local CIO. The findings reveal that the organisation of the interaction between the IT department and the local schools plays a crucial role in the enactment of IT governance. In this case, the problem of a fragmented organisation was solved by the creation of a hybrid organisation. Insights from this case study can therefore help CIOs from other local governments to learn how to successfully conduct IT governance. The case also shows how IT governance is distributed among a range of different actors at several levels of the organisation. The distribution of IT governance takes place in two directions. The first direction is from the top of the organisation (here the IT department) towards the bottom of the organisation (here a particular local school). The other direction is among different professionals where competence in the usage of IT is distributed from the professionals in the IT department to the professionals of the school sector. The insights of distributed leadership in two directions is a finding, which is salient to theoretical debates about IT governance. © 2018, Academic Conferences Limited.

Leading in time involves organizing temporal structures as well as continously addressing different depths of the past and future horizons. It is directed toward the attainment not only of creative work but also, particularly, of a creative world as a universe of novel signs and symbols. This creative world carries possibilities to influence both current and future generations of audiences and creators. The chapter draws on the case of artist Joan Miró who has been recognized among the greatest art innovators of the 20th century for establishing a novel visual language and esthetics. It distinguishes between two different enactments of Miró‘s creative leadership: time patterning and temporality work. Time patterning entails temporal organizing characterized by different tensions, whereas temporality work involves cultivating serendipity and surprise, extending events’ duration, stepping into new temporalities, and considering potentiality. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059149521

In this chapter, we show how microloans, small monetary loans to disadvantaged borrowers, obtain a uniquely romantic character and come to be framed as perfect gifts for the poor. Inspired by Simmel’s work (1990), we argue that the romanticization of microloans is tied to the romantic quality of money, credit, and capital. Microloans have indeed been popularized as romanticized gifts of microcredit, wherein credit is construed as opportunity-creating capital. We illustrate and elaborate on these arguments with insights obtained through prolonged investigation of online microlending platforms which enable lenders around the world to provide credit to poor entrepreneurs. In addition to outlining the romantic portrayals of microlending, we reflect on the role money and credit “romance” play in the financialization of development aid and humanitarianism and the spirit of capitalism more broadly. © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059138535

We use three examples from an ethnographic study to analyse the extent to which perceived indeterminacy influences affordance. Three types of affordances are conceptualised; shared affordance if low perceived indeterminacy, collective affordance if increasing perceived indeterminacy and pragmatic affordance if high indeterminacy. Cues from an “Interface Diagram model” artefact are sufficient to enact shared affordance, thus possibilities for actions across boundaries. Cues from a “Product Architecture model” artefact are adequate to enact collective affordance, thus possibilities for actions across boundaries.

Optimal pricing and inventory distribution policy is identified in the perspective of each member among three pragmatic procurement scenarios. Our results demonstrate that both integrated procurement strategies outperform conventional single-period decision and reduce double-marginalization effect. But, the retailer can prefer bulk procurement to earn maximum profit. The distributor acts as a catalyst, prevents the retailer from executing integrated multi-period procurement planning and creates conflict among supply chain members. Procurement decisions in presence of strategic inventory may lead to suboptimal profits compared to bulk procurement and supply chain members can face some implementation issues.

Thus, these smart vehicles produce a large amount of multimedia-related data that require fast and real-time processing. However, due to constrained computing and storage capacities, such huge amounts of multimedia-related data cannot be processed in on-board standalone devices. Thus, multimedia cloud computing (MCC) has emerged as an economical and scalable computing technology that can process multimedia-related data efficiently while providing improved Quality of Service (QoS) to vehicular users from anywhere, at any time and on any device, at reduced costs. However, there are certain challenges, such as fast service response time and resource cost optimization, that can severely affect the performance of the MCC. Therefore, to tackle these issues, in this paper, we propose a dynamic priority-based architecture for the MCC. In the proposed scheme, we divide multimedia processing into four different subphases, while computing resources to each computing server are assigned dynamically, according to the workload, in order to process multimedia tasks according to the multimedia user Quality of Experience (QoE) requirements. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in terms of service response time and resource cost optimization using the CloudSim simulator. © 2018 Amjad Ali et al.",,"Cloud computing; Digital storage; Motor transportation; Multimedia services; Multimedia systems; Quality of service; Traffic congestion; Weather forecasting; Cloud computing architectures; Computing resource; Multimedia processing; Quality of experience (QoE); Realtime processing; Scalable computing; Service response time; Stand-alone devices; Computer architecture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056544485

By adopting an exploratory inductive research, founded on core literature in the area and using empirical data from four companies in different industries, the paper contributes to GPD theory by examining the factors that drive different GPD configurations, extends GPD success factors in a global context, and proposes a novel framework useful for practitioners in the process of planning for global activities. The shift towards a global GPD strategy results in a series of interrelated changes which are strictly connected with the company's source of competitive advantage, their globalisation drivers, the globalisation practices adopted which create a global network, and the series of organisational capabilities needed to support the globalisation and the externalisation of knowledge sources.

Our results suggest that the factors size, capitalization, funding structure, organizational complexity and degree of market-based activities are key risk determinants. Moreover, we find evidence that the Danish case is relatively peculiar with respect to the effects of bank size and of degree of market-based activities: Bank size contributes positively to systematic and systemic risks, but not to individual risk. Degree of market-based activities contributes to counteract individual risk, but on the other hand intensifies systematic and systemic risks.

In order to comprehend the historical and systemic origins of these events, it is necessary to research theoretical and methodological frameworks aiming at avoiding the misunderstanding of them as individual, shortsighted and superficial. This study's objective is to identify and analyse disturbances and contradictory manifestations in organisational management. The development of this method is based on the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory, which was empirically applied in the activity of solid waste management of a university hospital. It was possible to analyse the existent disturbances between the ideal disposals of hospital residues and how the community has been discarding them. Therefore, it is necessary to understand that the analysis of the disturbances needs to precede the identification of the main hypothesis that causes the contradictions through the recuperation of the main historical changes occurred. © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Cultural-historical activity theory; Disturbances; Organisational change; Solid waste management; University hospital",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055827367

Along these lines, this paper focuses on an in-depth investigation of the domain of human capital in Isenberg's entrepreneurship ecosystem. It captures the entrepreneurial mindset of the highly complex individual as a requisite for entrepreneurial success and ultimately, for business growth and development. The increasing literature debating human capital confirms the relevance of locating and refining the factors for entrepreneurial success.

In this paper, the concept of murmuration, i.e. the collective behaviour of starlings, is introduced as a metaphor for sustainable innovation processes in construction. The murmuration metaphor captures the flowing, ever-changing non-structure that characterises innovation processes within sustainable construction. This conceptual hypothesis is based on an empirical observation, and the potentials of the metaphor are explored at two interdisciplinary workshops with actors from the Danish construction industry. The empirical validation shows that the murmuration metaphor can generate a useful framework for understanding and discussing sustainable innovation processes in construction. Furthermore, murmuration can be a fruitful addition to the understanding of the societal transition towards sustainability as an elaboration of the niche-to-regime processes emphasised in the Multi-Level Perspective. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","Innovation; Metaphor; Murmuration; Sustainable transition","Construction industry; Project management; Collective behaviour; Conceptual hypothesis; Empirical validation; Metaphor; Murmuration; Societal transitions; Sustainable construction; Sustainable transition; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055672115

However, it has been difficult to create a dominant paradigm that translates CSCM into effective and value-added practices. Drawing on a critical literature review combining insights from Neo-Institutional Theory and Engaged Scholarship principles, the paper presents an alternative practice oriented framework for advancing CSCM. The contribution is a supplement to the macro-oriented agenda typically associated with industrial change, which often neglects to consider the relationship between micro-practices and institutional logics in the effort of progress. In particular, the proposed framework acknowledges pluralism and contextual sensitivity as a prerequisite for providing greater insight into the problematic and messy nature of industry change. In conclusion, the role of micro-level agency is agued to be instrumental for the further progress of CSCM. Thus, the paper attempts to re-orientate CSCM by presenting a framework based on participatory analysis and critical discussions combining field and individual-level perspectives. The research limitations are affected by the CSCM research conducted in non-positivistic paradigms, which involves a certain amount of subjectivity as some of the arguments depends on the authors' perceptions. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","CSCM; Engaged scholarship; Pluralism; Research methods; Sensitivity","Construction industry; Project management; Construction supply chain; Construction supply chain management; Critical discussions; CSCM; Engaged scholarship; Neo-institutional theories; Pluralism; Sensitivity; Supply chain management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055668373

In the construction context, public-private partnerships have recently given promises of increased productivity and innovative solutions through business models combining logics and governance structures from both the public and private sectors. Little is, however, known about how partnerships are established to combine different logics in response to competing institutional demands. Drawing on a study of a municipality's efforts to create cost efficient services, we analyse the formation of two partnerships as emerging hybrid organizations in the intersection between four institutional logics. We show how different logics are mobilized in the process of shaping the partnerships in response to the institutional pluralism and complexity they face. On this background, we discuss how the contours of two different forms of hybrid organization emerged, even though the partnerships initially operated and responded similarly to the institutional demands. We conclude that partnerships can be seen as 'trading zones' that follow different trajectories in coping with institutional demands, and hence the development of hybrid organizational forms. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","Complexity; Hybrid organizations; Institutional logics; PPP; Trading zones","Commerce; Project management; Complexity; Governance structures; Increased productivity; Innovative solutions; Institutional logic; Organizational forms; Public and private sector; Public private partnerships; Mergers and acquisitions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055644125

Compared to available resources, retrofits are deemed costly, and there is a need to improve productivity. One approach is to realise digital integration and (partial) automation processes, creating more performative digital practices. However what digitalisation should target and its scope is difficult to decide. Even standard concepts like Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) have many variants. To capture the performance gain of digitalisation requires measurement methods, while most methods are designed for new built and production, and does not appreciate the costs and values that characterize retrofit using digital practices. This paper aims at conceptualizing a method for understanding performance in digitalized retrofit of social housing. A review of approaches to productivity, efficiency and performance is done. Values produced are multidimensional and cannot be reduced to costs per m2. Performance is proposed conceptualized as values produced for clients, tenants and companies, and then compared to costs and effects of the digital practices. The context is two phases of a large Scandinavian retrofit project, followed by a longitudinal study using a mixed method approach. The social housing consists of 900 apartments in blocks and in row houses at 70.000 m2. The refurbishment encompasses new bath rooms, ventilation and parts of the building envelope. A gradual VDC implementation is carried out, avoiding an ambitious overall implementation. The performance is dependent of hybrid ICT and organizational practices, where the interaction with tenants is important. It is therefore a hybrid set of factors that lever performance, including intense coordination among contractors, continual communication, interaction with tenants and the craftsmen's learning during production. The impact of ICT is more indirect. Technology optimism or not, It is not technology alone that improves the performance. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","Information technology; Performance; Refurbishment; Stakeholder","Costs; Housing; Information technology; Productivity; Project management; Continual communication; Efficiency and performance; Measurement methods; Organizational practices; Performance; Refurbishment; Stakeholder; Virtual design and constructions; Retrofitting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055641324

An important part of this potential is by using building information standards, such as Omniclass and IFC. This research has aimed at evaluating the use of building information standards and its impact on innovation. Standards are understood as classification of information and rules for building processes. Selected literature help reveal the multiple character of relevant standardization in building and the effects on innovation. Ten types of effect are identified. Three national longitudinal case studies of hospital projects in Scandinavia were carried out. Many barriers for innovation when using standards were found. The regional public authorities can decide to adopt standards locally and in two out of three cases they did not. For the companies this is a business consideration: In the Norwegian case, the proactive adoption of the architect, meant benefits for the client and contractor. However, other actors did not follow. In the Swedish case, BIM coordination was hampered by incompatible design systems. In the Danish case, the client demanded use of Cuneco Classification System, a Danish information standard, but the classification was done in a reactive manner at a late stage. The Danish and the Norwegian case were innovative, but the Swedish less so. Nine out of ten types of effects were found in the cases. Standard-enabled innovations were mixed with other innovations. The two most remarkable were the Danish reverse innovation, and the Norwegian shift of structural concept. The information standards and BIM are closely intertwined in practice. A common database of coded objects in the Danish case is a strong innovation enabled by standards. The use of TFM, in the Norwegian architect project and its subsequent use in site BIM is remarkable. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","BIM; Hospitals; Information standards; Scandinavia","Architectural design; Cost reduction; Digital communication systems; Hospitals; Information use; Project management; Classification system; Digital communications; Information standards; Longitudinal case study; Public authorities; Reverse innovations; Scandinavia; Structural concept; Classification (of information)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055627655

The deterministic approach to project management implies the possibility of planning, managing and controlling the construction project phenomena and project actors' roles. This belief is dominant in the industry and the practice of collaboration will be influenced by it. The need to improve collaboration and move the project forward can be addressed a facilitation, however, it is unclear how facilitation takes place in inter-organizational project teams. This study is part of a larger project, which aims to address the skills and competencies needed for professionals in the industry to encourage collaboration and co-configuration between the actors to minimize the effect of the fragmentation within the industry. An earlier study in a Danish school setting suggests that the deterministic approach towards project management contradicts with the need for disruptive breaks from routines, which encourages co-configuration as seen in knotworking. The deterministic approach demands a certain mind-set among the actors, when delivering a known product in a known production process with a known division of labour, while the mind-set of co-configuration entails upsetting these relationships. It is possible to organize the breaks from the deterministic approach and it has previously been demonstrated, how a facilitator can help making the switch between the two mind-sets. A literature review is carried out to investigate which perspectives facilitation theory can bring to improving collaboration in the construction project. The literature presents a belief in facilitation as a way to improve collaboration although no single unified recipe for facilitation was found. A further investigation into how to approach facilitation of collaboration so focus can become on how to share critical resources for project efficiency as well as learning is recommended. © Proceeding of the 34th Annual ARCOM Conference, ARCOM 2018.","Facilitation; Literature review; Project management","Construction projects; Critical resources; Deterministic approach; Facilitation; Inter-organizational; Literature reviews; Production process; Project efficiency; Project management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055622784

Financial capital has been found to be concentrated in metropolitan areas and access to capital easier because entrepreneurs leverage on proximity to capital providers. However, regardless of whether it is metropoles, when there is an urban centre of a certain size or relative dominance in a region, it can be hypothesized that financial capital is likely to be attracted to this urban centre even within a peripheral region. The literature has been silent regarding financial 'centres' within peripheral areas. Survey responses from managers in 834 firms are used in the empirical analyses. We find that even within the periphery there is a periphery-core difference. We also find indications of differences in whether firms are financially constrained depending on the levels and types of geographical aggregation that are used in the models. Intra-regional differences accentuate the need for considering the appropriate regional level of policy making and the policy instruments. The paper contributes specifically to the analysis of geographical scale in regional financial constraints. The issue of scale is in the core of economic geography yet often disregarded both in research and in the process of designing regional policies. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

This paper is presenting and discussing a risk management framework for ET based on Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) and ISO 31000:2018. This paper is based on (1) a literature review on FMEA and ISO 31000 particularly related to technologies in early stages of conceiving, design and appropriation, (2) a case study of ET and risk in heavy mechanical manufacturing, (3) a set of micro-cases from the industry. Two models are proposed. First, an overall model framework is defined connecting early stages of technology screening, scouting, foresighting to the ISO 31000 framework extending this with continuous improvement of the model and the handling of the ET elements. Second, FMEA is suggested extended with an uncertainty factor to be multiplied onto the risk priority number (RPN). The uncertainty factor is closely linked to the ISO 31000 framework in parameters like e.g. novelty of the ET, growth predictions, duration of the ET study, industrial impact, ambiguity of definitions. ET is inherently associated with risk but often not a managed risk, extending ET risk focus into FMEA and ISO 31000 is providing a clearer and more uniform RM throughout the innovation life cycle. The presented framework can support better decision making and adherence to standardized risk management in later stages of development and implementation of the ET. FMEA can connect ET to other risk management, risk mitigation and continuous improvement approaches such as design, project or production FMEA. Introducing a common language in early stages of innovation can ""lowerthe barrier"" for SME's and organisations in emerging economies to access ET rightfully. © 2018 Proceedings of the European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE.

Scholars have theorized how the aesthetics of technology products shift over the course of the technology lifecycle. These scholars posit that there is limited aesthetic innovation during the era of ferment, but that producers engage in aesthetic innovation when the technology matures to differentiate their products in the market. We extend this theory through an inductive examination of technological and aesthetic innovations in the hearing aid industry over the 70-year period 1945-2015. We identify that each technology lifecycle is associated with a dominant aesthetic'that is an aesthetic manifestation, which is present in the majority of products during that lifecycle. In contrast to existing theory we show that the shift between dominant aesthetics occurs during the era of ferment. We find that categorical aspirations'aiming for the product to take on the meaning of other product categories'are a core driver of aesthetic innovation. Over the course of the technology lifecycle producers become dissatisfied with their products' aesthetic manifestations and they begin to draw analogies to other product categories. These new categorical aspirations do not spur new aesthetic manifestations'they remain latent. However, when a technological discontinuity jolts the existing dominant aesthetic it frees up producers to experiment with the accumulated latent categorical aspirations. After a period of aesthetic experimentation, the industry settles into a new dominant aesthetic, which undergoes minor aesthetic elaborations as the technology matures. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The study demonstrates how the distance between newcomers and experienced team members make newcomers engage in ‘identification work’; participatory behaviours that make them more like their fellow experienced team members and fosters identification with their team. Existing team members correspondingly engage in ‘socialisation work’, behaviours that either hinder or foster the socialisation process of newcomers. Reflecting the norms and values in the teams, the team also determines acceptance mechanisms, by which newcomers become considered as full team members. Together, these relational micro-processes of socialisation construct how newcomers’ come to identify with their team. This research adds to and holds implications for the existing literatures on identification and socialisation by showing that they are inextricably intertwined in demonstrating the practices team members collectively engage in when constructing newcomers’ identification in teams. © 2018 Academy of Management.

Further, I propose that coastal and inland firms develop different routines from coastal and inland acquisition experience. I test these arguments on a panel dataset of listed Chinese firms, tracing their acquisition behavior from 2006 to 2015. My analyses suggest that acquisition experience outside of the home province matters and that, in the case of inland firms, coastal acquisition experience is particularly beneficial for future internationalization.

Using data from a survey of 280 new ventures combined with secondary and patent data, we show that although network capability is beneficial at low to intermediate levels, it decreases new venture survival at high levels. The influence of network capability on survival also decreases under conditions of high environmental hostility but no moderation effect is found for environmental dynamism. Our results suggest that investment in dynamic capabilities in new ventures should be optimized, not maximized, for survival.

Both streams rely on the assumption of long-term owners, who create spillovers to other stakeholders or enable synergies between stakeholders and shareholders. However, stock-holding periods have become much shorter over the past decades, causing unprecedented ownership volatility. In this paper, we clarify the impact of ownership volatility on stakeholder orientation. Drawing on an attention perspective, we argue that two distinct mechanisms are at play: First, an increase in ownership volatility attracts managers' short-term situated attention, leading to a narrow orientation to shareholders. Second, a constantly high level of ownership volatility affects managers' long-term focus of attention, motivating a broad stakeholder orientation. Based on an empirical study of more than 1,300 firms, we find evidence for our arguments. Our main theoretical contribution is that firms' stakeholder orientation is not set ex ante, but changes over time with ownership volatility. © 2018 Academy of Management.

The empirical setting for this discussion is the Danish public sector which has been among the first movers to implement e-government solutions. Denmark has a long tradition of issuing public policies defining goals of front-office e-services as well as back-office digitization. Rule-based decision-making systems represent an ideal driver for actualizing the visions outlined in these policies. This chapter presents an experience where a rule-based decision-making system was introduced in an agency which handles complex cases requiring in-depth discretion by specialized professional caseworkers.

However, large-scale transport projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail system in the UK seem to have pushed this approach beyond its limits, leading to broad discontent with the appraisal process. There is a need both to develop new methods capable of integrating a wide range of perspectives in a systematic manner and to test these for large-scale projects. Multicriteria analysis (MCA) has proven useful in supporting transport decision-making by including a broader set of criteria in the appraisal process. Multiactor multicriteria analysis (MAMCA) has extended this approach to include multiple actors and stakeholders in the judgment and decision-making process. This paper builds on the MAMCA method and demonstrates its practicability and usability by applying it to the case of HS2. The purpose of this paper is not to reach a definitive conclusion on the desirability of various project options, but to complement existing transport appraisal methods by making different perspectives explicit. For example, the results for this case show contrasting views for different groups of transport professionals: a favorable assessment of HS2 among transport planners employed in government, but an unfavorable assessment among transport researchers with a background in sustainability. In terms of contribution to the development of data collection methods, this research demonstrates the usefulness of conducting semistructured interviews in conjunction with an online questionnaire for the assessment and weighting process within MCA. Because MCA results are expressed in terms of relative desirability of projects, the approach also effectively systematizes the inclusion and assessment of multiple options. Overall, the proposed method enhances the capacity to analyze conflicting views in large-scale transport project appraisal processes. © 2018 Yannick Cornet et al.",,"Decision making; Railroad transportation; Surveys; Sustainable development; Data collection method; Environmental assessment; Judgment and decision makings; Large-scale projects; Large-scale transport; Multi Criteria Analysis; Online questionnaire; Semi structured interviews; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052811642

What is more, these organizations often require workers to be permanently on call and demonstrate high production rates. Consequences of such practices include frazzled employees, with their families’ and their own health under pressure. This article introduces our special issue of the German Journal of Human Resource Management. It tackles the many reasons behind excessive work hours and failed attempts to change working time arrangements in organizations. It first identifies three core ideas in previous research, namely the dispersed nature of regimes of excessive working hours, their high levels of persistence and their constitution at multiple levels of analysis. It then summarizes the contributions in this special issue. Finally, it proposes avenues for future research, such as focusing on the genesis and the historicity of organizational working time regimes, studying the interrelation of factors across multiple levels of analysis, and probing new theories to explain the extreme persistence of excessive working hours. The overarching aim of our special issue in this core area of human resource management is to contribute to an understanding of organizational working time regimes and the tenacity of excessive working hours in an effort to deepen our knowledge of how to change them. © The Author(s) 2018.","Change; Excessive working hours; Overwork; Persistence; Working time; Working time flexibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052335408

Indeed, in many cases, the number of people who watch an event via its telecast far exceeds the number of people attending the event. In this context, gaining information about event telecast audiences is as critical as gaining information about event attendees. However, most of the research undertaken on understanding event consumers has focused on attendees who are physically present at events. Very little is known about how consumers of the telecasts of events compare with attendees at events. This research aimed to address this knowledge gap and identify whether consumers of a telecast event were similar to, or different from, those consumers who attend events in person in terms of their demographics, psychographics, and behavioral intentions. The focal event for this study was a large-scale national commemorative event in Australia and New Zealand. Data were collected using an online questionnaire from a purposive sample (n = 1,152) comprising both Australian (58%) and New Zealand (42%) residents, of which 580 of the entire sample were attendees at the event and 572 participated in the event via their telecasts. The results show that the two cohorts (1: event attendees and 2: event telecast participants) with an interest in the event show significant differences. Event attendees and event telecast participants are different in terms of gender, experience with the event/ telecast (first-time participation, number of prior events, and number in party), motivations, emotions experienced, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions regarding the event/telecast. However, the two cohorts did not differ on age, education, household income, or their levels of patriotism. This study contributes to the event management literature as it extends our knowledge of consumers of events and provides a comparative analysis of event attendees and event telecast participants of a largescale event. These findings provide valuable insights for event and telecast planners as well as other stakeholders about the two cohorts of event participants. The study is novel because it reports on data collected from both Australians and New Zealanders about this event rather than focusing on just one country, as previous research has tended to do. © 2018 Cognizant, LLC.","Anzac Day; Commemorative events; Event attendees; Event telecast; Event telecast consumers; Large-scale events; Motivations; Patriotism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052245079

The paper is based on original data combining semi-structured interviews and analysis of the content of the contracts used for governing hospitals. The paper relies on an in-depth study of the Danish hospitals located in Greater Copenhagen. The case is a purposefully selected critical case. Methodologically, the paper builds on critical realism. The paper finds that, contrary to what is proposed by proponents of the networked governance approach, new public management is not reduced in importance but becoming increasingly institutionalised. The paper suggests that this is a problem in connection with solving wicked problems based on tools from the networked governance approach.

Going beyond the typical focus on R&D, the focus of this article is on engaging those employees who are active in 'productive' activities in innovation. This article explores how a firm can create an environment in which those employees can build on their local needs and knowledge to learn and innovate through a process of experimentation and problem solving during 'on-the-job' activities. I draw on innovation, creativity and organisational climate research to explore the determinants and effects of such innovative behaviour. I develop a theoretical framework of how organisational practices affect employees' willingness and ability to experiment - a behavioural integral to innovation. I furthermore argue that the relationship between such 'climate for innovation' and the ultimate performance is inverse U-shaped. The framework implies that managers can turn the entire organisation into an innovation lab but they need to balance the tension between productive and innovative practices.

Informed by life course theory, we argue that depending on duration and timing, human capital can depreciate during work interruptions (such as unemployment or parental leave) but also be restored by re-entering and staying in the job market. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, we analyse the educational and occupational life courses of individuals who have started a business. We investigate whether there are patterns in the biographies of these individuals. Exploratory analysis reveals that seven types of founders can be differentiated. In this sample, cluster 1 appeared to be most successful in terms of early-stage firm survival. Sequence analysis has proved to be a valuable method to improve the efficiency of research on the life courses of business founders. This study invites future research to take a deeper look at life-course-based factors of business activity and success.

In particular, we first employ the popular Inductive Miner to generate a fully imperative model from a log. Like most imperative miners, the Inductive Miner tends to return so-called flower models for the less structured parts of the process. These parts are often imprecise. To counter these imprecise parts, we replace them with declarative models to increase the precision since declarative models are good at specifying which behavior is disallowed. The approach has been implemented in ProM and tested on several synthetic and real-life event logs. Our experiments show that hybrid models can be found to be more precise without overfitting the data. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Declare; Hybrid process model; Process discovery; Process mining; Process tree","Information systems; Information use; Business process model; Declarative models; Declare; Hybrid model; Hybrid process; Life events; Process Discovery; Process mining; Miners",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050614073

This gives an easy overview, but can also be rather tedious and require much trivial work for simple things. We therefore challenge this approach and propose to do ETL programming by writing code. To make the programming easy, we present the Python-based framework pygrametl which offers commonly used functionality for ETL development. By using the framework, the developer can efficiently create effective ETL solutions from which the full power of programming can be exploited.

The pilot studies were carried out in the test membrane bioreactor, manufactured by company ""Alfa Laval"" (Denmark). The process of biological treatment of wastewater using the membrane bioreactor makes it possible to intensify the operation of biological treatment plants due to the lack of facilities for settling the sewers, an increase in the dose of active sludge up to 12-13 g/l; the process of deposition is replaced with filtration, washing of membrane modules can be carried out without emptying the tanks and without taking modules out of the tanks. In the process of testing of the membrane bioreactor, based on the module plant, manufactured by company ""Alfa Laval"" (Denmark) for treatment of domestic wastewater, the treatment mode that meets the requirements for discharge was achieved. Treatment effectiveness by basic indicators was: COD - 93 %, BOD5 - 99 %, suspended substances - 98.5 %, ammonium nitrogen - 98.5%. Operation efficiency of MBR as for nitrates amounted to 89 % after adjustment of reagent's dose (40-50 mg/l) and the oxygen dose in the nitrification zone (2-3 mg/l). Efficiency of 98.6% for phosphates was achieved after the introduction of the reagent aluminum sulfate with the dosage of 40-50 mg/l. The study conducted has made it possible to obtain the consistent operation mode of the MBR with ensuring effective process of wastewater treatment. Dependences of wastewater treatment efficiency on the MBR as for major contaminants (COD, BOD5, nitrogen compounds and phosphorus) were shown. This enables meeting the strict requirements for wastewater discharge into water bodies and decreasing the cost value of the treatment through a decrease in power consumption. The mechanism of the MBR operation under conditions of treatment of actual wastewater, which allows determining the conditions of the use of the MBR in the technology of the biological wastewater treatment was studied. © T.

This paper is developing a position of EA-driven BPM as being long-term, strategic and “slow”, whereas CI is short-term, operational and “fast”. A case study is presented, where CI is furthermore locally based and BPM is centrally based in a larger organization. This leads to conflicts between BPM and CI where the corporate value of both is eroded as IS initiatives on ERP implementation are prolonged and CI initiatives fail to match to-be scenarios. This paper discuss EA as a mediator, where EA is communicating business opportunities to “positive” CI initiatives and aiming at stopping “negative” CI initiatives. An EA-based process tracing mechanism is suggested and demonstrated connecting business processes, ERP, and silo-based elements for CI initiatives. Furthermore, a CI project management tool is discussed to outline screening opportunities for EA-based CI reviews. An agenda is developed to ensure that CI projects are developed according to the Enterprise Architecture and developed along the organizational architecture and not as silo projects. Furthermore Enterprise Architecture is in such case not alone to induce changes and EA must develop methods to synchronise and coordinate with other change processes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Business process management; Continuous improvement; Enterprise architecture","Administrative data processing; Enterprise resource management; Information systems; Information use; Process engineering; Project management; Business opportunities; Business process management; Continuous improvements; Enterprise Architecture; ERP implementation; Organizational architecture; Project management tools; Systems requirements; Enterprise resource planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050007239

These IT platforms can be seen as forms of open and closed innovation search, where the first aims to perform distant search beyond the organizational boundaries, while the second is used to conduct local search within the firm. Nevertheless, limited attention has been placed on investigating which tensions emerge when firms combine these conflicting innovation search strategies and related management approaches to address them. By drawing on a qualitative, inductive case study of a large organization headquartered in France, our study identifies and discusses three key paradoxes emerging from pursuing both innovation forms: (1) paradox of identity; (2) paradox of organizing the innovation process; and (3) paradox of boundary management. Moreover, we discuss different management approaches implemented by managers to address the identified paradoxes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Crowdsourcing platforms; Open innovation; Paradoxes","Crowdsourcing; Information systems; Closed innovations; Crowdsourcing platforms; External customers; Large organizations; Limited attentions; Open innovation; Organizational boundaries; Paradoxes; Information use",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049948053

In this time banks have also moved from focusing purely on commercial banking activities to being heavily involved in market-based and transaction-oriented wholesale and investment banking activities. By carrying out an all-encompassing set of activities, banks have become large, complex, interconnected, and inclined to levels of risk-taking not previously seen. With the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis it became apparent that there was an issue of institutions being too big to fail. This book analyses the too-big-to-fail problem of banks in the EU. It approaches the topic from an interdisciplinary perspective using behavioural finance as a tool to examine the occurrence of the global financial crisis and the emergence of the structural problem in large banking institutions. The book draws a comparison between the EU, the US and the UK and the relevant rules to assess the effectiveness of various approaches to regulation in a global context. Chen Chen Hu goes on to use behavioural analyses to provide new insights in evaluating the current structural reform rules in the EU Proposal on Bank Structural Regulation and the newly adopted bank recovery and resolution regime in the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in the Single Resolution Regulation. © 2018 Chen Chen Hu.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049814846

Even though those three perspectives cover a broad range of currently relevant applications there are no widely accepted and commonly used corresponding concepts and terms. This is an obstacle to broadly understand, effectively integrate, and adequately assess such systems. We address this problem, by considering a (component-based) methodological derivation of technical (software) specifications based on underlying enterprise models. That is because context states are about the enterprise environment of a (software) system while the delivery of context-aware services is about technical (software) functionalities; hence, we need a perspective on both. We consider the SDBC (Software Derived from Business Components) approach that brings together enterprise modeling and software specification. On that basis: (a) We deliver a base context-awareness conceptualization; (b) We partially align it to agent technology because adapting behaviors to environments assumes some kind of pro-activity that is only fully covered by agent systems, in our view.

The paper identifies how, in particular, three interrelated routines appear to trigger moments of recursive learning and employee-driven innovation (EDI) among employees. These routines are: 1) an organisational form of global communities of practice; 2) a 'cookbook' representing a set of guidelines to ensure a common approach to the sharing of best practices; 3) a set of governance procedures to support continual improvements. They do so by allowing employees to: a) collectively engage in and work towards a common purpose; b) identify, document and share knowledge about the problems and solutions they encounter in regard to their work; c) continually improve work practices. The findings contribute to an understanding of how organisational structuring of EDI can be developed and managed, and highlight the importance of deliberately organising routines, spaces and moments to foster such dynamics.

Despite a growing interest in co-design and the effects of engaging citizens (or users) in public service innovation, far too little attention has been paid to the potential influence and learning dynamics of: 1) inclusion of user perspectives; 2) of using co-design approaches on employees' practice, learning, and innovation. Through the theoretical lens of 'boundary encounters', this article offers a learning perspective on the influence of co-design approaches on employee-driven innovation. It reports the findings from an exploratory case study in a prison context. The analysis shows that including user perspectives creates strange perspectives on familiar routines, and that reflective and transformative learning dynamics emerge in sequences of experience prototypes and storytelling. It is argued that co-design approaches hold potential for employees to reframe meaning and innovate practice, and can enhance individual and organisational learning.

On the one hand, the Nordics have taken leading positions in promoting environmental issues on the international stage. On the other hand, however, their high productivity, which is needed to support their welfare aspirations, has made them reluctant to promote and implement ecological measures that would limit economic growth. The chapter shows how this Nordic dualism may also be ecologically justified. In terms of biological capacity, three of the large Nordic countries - Finland, Norway and Sweden - are capable of absorbing their ecological footprints, given their vast territories and small populations. In terms of climate emissions per capita, however, the Nordics- apart from Sweden - are mediocre performers. When it comes to the implementation of climate policy, there is considerable Nordic diversity. Most of the Nordic countries have embarked on a path towards lowering their carbon emissions. However, their trajectories have varied greatly, reflecting differences in industrial structure and resource bases. Nevertheless, a belief in urban greening is widely shared, and the Nordic capitals top European green city rankings. Based on a green growth agenda, urban greening may provide an attractive opportunity for bridging ecological preservation and economic development, and allow the Nordics to transcend their ecology-versus-growth dilemma. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Nina Witoszek and Atle Midttun.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049547192

But they are also an enigma in a cultural-evolutionary sense: though by no means following the same socio-economic formula, they are all cases of a “non-hubristic”, socially sustainable modernity that puzzles outside observers. Using Nordic welfare states as its laboratory, Sustainable Modernity combines evolutionary and socio-cultural perspectives to illuminate the mainsprings of what the authors call the “well-being society”. The main contention is that Nordic uniqueness is not merely the outcome of one particular set of historical institutional or political arrangements, or sheer historical luck; rather, the high welfare creation inherent in the Nordic model has been predicated on a long and durable tradition of social cooperation, which has interacted with global competitive forces. Hence the socially sustainable Nordic modernity should be approached as an integrated and tightly orchestrated ecosystem based on a complex interplay of cooperative and competitive strategies within and across several domains: normative-cultural, socio-political and redistributive. The key question is: Can the Nordic countries uphold the balance of competition and cooperation and reproduce their resilience in the age of globalization, cultural collisions, the digital economy, the fragmentation of the work/life division and often intrusive EU regulation? With contributors providing insights from the humanities, the social sciences and evolutionary science, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of political science, sociology, history, institutional economics, Nordic studies and human evolution studies. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Nina Witoszek and Atle Midttun.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049544495

The Nordic deployment of CSR, however, shows otherwise. This chapter demonstrates that, while solid domestic welfare state arrangements are certainly not substituted by CSR, Nordic companies and Nordic state governments have appropriated CSR pragmatically in areas where traditional welfare state policies lack resources or outreach. One of these areas is the international economy, where CSR becomes part of what can be called a tacit strategy for “civilizing global capitalism”. This chapter shows how CSR may be part of a “soft law” approach, where the Nordics and like-minded countries push an institutional agenda for social and environmental upgrading of the international economy. The soft CSR approach could be seen as a stepping stone towards hard law. However, the chapter also shows how the Nordic political embrace of CSR may in itself be an emerging modality of international governance - a “partnered governance” where sustainability-oriented states and businesses, seconded by civil society organizations, work together, challenging each other in a normative space in brand-sensitive markets in a communicative society. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Nina Witoszek and Atle Midttun.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049544150

It also discusses how the Nordic countries can meet these challenges while reinventing the Nordic model for the globalized age. The chapter focuses especially on the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy; the demanding confrontation with digital sharing and robotization; the pressure exerted by liberalization and Europeanization; and the challenges posed by new forms of industrial organization. The discussion is presented in the form of a scenario analysis, with three alternative trajectories: “Dualization”, “Resilience” and “Transformation”. Dualization represents a shift of the Nordic model toward a neoliberal direction with more “unfiltered” international market pressure, which increases inequalities, while the Nordic social contract and welfare arrangements weaken. Resilience represents a continuation of the Nordic model through the development of new alternatives to old working arrangements that have been overrun by liberalization, and combining them with the elements of the “classic model” that still work. Transformation goes beyond the dualism and resilience scenarios in factoring in the Nordic model’s exposure to radical technological innovation. This scenario explores the model’s assets and capabilities to meet new challenges and dilemmas. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Nina Witoszek and Atle Midttun.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049541355

The qualitative data will be supplemented with description of program activities and patient questionnaires. Program logic modelling is suggested to inform a logic analysis of how expected RTW outcomes and delivery of program activities are aligned and how contextual characteristics may clarify differences in achieved RTW outcomes. The proposed process evaluation approach may inform future design discussions and theoretical understanding, and it is expected that the applied knowledge gained through this study may help rehabilitation professionals better navigate potential challenges in clinical evaluation efforts. © The Author(s) 2018.","interactive research; logic modelling; occupational rehabilitation; process evaluation; program theory; return to work; study design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049314935

Owing to its substantial brown coal and iron ore deposits, numerous coal mines were opened and two large iron and steel making complexes established over time, transforming the landscape tremendously. Urbanization also accelerated due to extensive industrialization. Besides the great number of workers’ settlements erected in the vicinity of the mines and factories, two towns, Miskolc and ózd were emerging as leading centers of iron and steel making (see Figure 5.1). In order to emphasize the significance of the region in the country’s economy, it was labelled as the ‘Hungarian Ruhr’ between the two world wars, turning into the emblem of forced heavy industrialization in the state Socialist period. Following deindustrialization, however, the similarities between the two regions were completely disregarded. In the ‘Hungarian Ruhr’, no large-scale regional regeneration program, such as the Internationale Bauausstellung Emscher Park, has been developed capitalizing on its rich industrial heritage. As a result, the material culture of coal mining and iron making has been demolished or is desperately decaying; only little could be preserved. There can be no doubt that the complexity of recent historical developments, including the sudden change of the political system in the 1990s and subsequent extensive privatization, amongst others, is responsible for generally not considering the vestiges of heavy industry as valuable cultural heritage representing the regional identity. This chapter aims to investigate the current distressing state of heavy industrial heritage in relation to the region’s industrial identity, which came to be faltering over the past three decades. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Christian Wicke, Stefan Berger and Jana Golombek; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048923683

It is argued that multinational firms may use global cities to establish bridgeheads-subsidiaries at intermediate levels of the ownership chain that enable further international as well as subnational expansion. Design/methodology/approach: Beyond those host country subsidiaries that are directly owned by a foreign multinational, the authors go deeper and focus specifically on the multi-tiered – “subsidiaries of subsidiaries” to examine how the geographic origins and destinations of these investments are associated with micro-location choices in a host country. Findings: The authors find that there are substantial differences between the types, roles, activities and geographic origins of the firms locating in different areas, and in the ownership structures spanning them. The authors propose that this has managerial and theoretical implications which may be understood based on an organizing framework describing a tradeoff between the pursuit of global connectivity and local density on the one hand and cost control on the other. Research limitations/implications: Empirical work on foreign location choices should take into account ownership structures and take a more fine-grained view of subnational variation. Practical implications: Managers need to consider the trade-offs between connectivity, density and costs when making foreign location decisions. Social implications: Policy makers should think about the unique contributions that various subnational regions such as global and ordinary cities can make to global value chains. Originality/Value: The authors bridge the hitherto separate literatures pertaining to subsidiary mandates and subnational dimensions of foreign location choice by investigating the fine-grained roles and ownership structures from a supranational as well as subnational perspective. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Foreign subsidiaries; Global cities; Location choice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048660430

Most of the process mining algorithms assume the existence of an event log with a certain maturity level. Unfortunately, the logs provided by process unaware information systems often do not comply with the required maturity level, since they lack the notion of process instance, also referred in process mining as “case id”. Without a proper identification of the case id attribute in log files, the outcome of process mining algorithms is unpredictable. This paper proposes a new approach that aims to overcome this challenge by automatically inferring the case id attribute from log files.

The pores within organic matter (OM) of organic-rich shales develop during thermal maturation as different hydrocarbon phases are generated and expelled from the OM. Organic-rich shales can potentially retain a large proportion of the hydrocarbons generated during the diagenesis process. Commercial hydrocarbon production from liquid-rich shale reservoirs can be achieved using completion technologies such as multi-stage-fractured horizontal wells (MFHWs). However, the ability of industry to identify ""sweet spots"" along MFHWs is still hampered by insufficient understanding of the effect of type/content of entrained hydrocarbon/OM components on reservoir quality. The primary objective of the current study is therefore to investigate the impact of entrained hydrocarbon/OM on storage and transport properties of the organic-rich shales. To accomplish this goal, a comprehensive suite of petrophysical analyses are performed on a diverse sample suite from the Duvernay Formation (a prolific Canadian shale oil reservoir) differing in organic matter content (2.8-5 wt.%; n = 5), before and after sequential pyrolysis by a revised Rock-Eval analysis (extended slow heating (ESH) Rock-Eval analysis; Sanei et al., 2015). Using the ESH cycle, different hydrocarbon/OM components can be distinguished more easily and reliability during the pyrolysis process: 1) free light oil (S1ESH; up to 150 °C), 2) fluid-like hydrocarbon residue (S2a; 150-380 °C) and 3) solid bitumen/residual carbon (S2b; 380-650 °C). The characterization techniques at each stage are helium pycnometry (grain density, helium porosity); low-pressure gas (N2, CO2) adsorption (pore volume, surface area, pore size distribution within micropores, mesopores and smaller macropores); crushed-rock gas (He, CO2, N2) permeability and rate-of-adsorption (ROA) analysis (CO2, N2). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis is further conducted to verify/support the petrophysical observations. Compared to the ""as-received"" state, porosity, permeability, modal pore size distribution and surface area increase with sequential pyrolysis stages, associated with expulsion and devolatilization of free light oil and fluid-like hydrocarbon residue (S2a; up to 380 °C). However, the change in petrophysical properties associated with the degradation of solid bitumen/residual carbon (S2b; up to 650 °C) is variable and unpredictable. The observed reduction in porosity/permeability values after the S2b stage are likely attributed to 1) occlusion of pore volume with solid bitumen/residual carbon degradation (i.e. coking) and/ or 2) sample swelling due to water loss from lattice structure of clay minerals (i.e. illite) and 3) sample compaction as a result of OM removal from the rock matrix. The present study is a continuation of previous works (Clarke et al., 2016, 2017), aiming to elucidate the impact of different type and content of entrained hydrocarbons/OM on reservoir quality of organic-rich shales. Quantification of the evolution of reservoir quality with thermal maturity has important implications for 1) identifying petrophysical ""sweet spots"" within unconventional reservoirs, for the purpose of optimizing stimulation design and 2) targeting specific zones within the reservoir of interest with organic matter content/type amenable to maximizing gas storage/transport during cyclic solvent injection for enhanced oil recovery applications. The integrated workflow proposed herein is of significant interest to Duvernay operators for developing optimized stimulation treatments for improving primary and enhanced hydrocarbon recovery.

This was done by analysing how devices persuaded people into actions, resulting in drifts that both led to the creation of a Shared Service Centre (SSC) and transformed it into a cost centre, something resembling an internal joint venture, followed by a profit centre and, finally, a centre of expertise.

The aim was to show how links between humans and non-humans in the form of management devices brought about drifts leading to the formation and transformation of a SSC. Findings: Attachments between devices and humans fuelled the formation and transformation of the SSC. Such innovations were revealed to be a series of drifts, which demonstrates that an SSC is not a static object but rather an ever-evolving innovation.

Design/methodology/approach: In a newly accredited Danish hospital, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews to capture broad ranging experiences. Medical doctors, nurses, a quality coordinator and a quality department employee participated. Interviews were audio recorded and subjected to framework analysis. Findings: Staff reported that The Danish Healthcare Quality Programme affected management priorities: office time and working on documentation, which reduced time with patients and on improvement activities. Organisational structures were improved during preparation for accreditation. Staff perceived that the hospital was better prepared for new QI initiatives after accreditation; staff found disease specific requirements unnecessary. Other areas benefited from accreditation. Interviewees expected that organisational changes, owing to accreditation, would be sustained and that the QI focus would continue. Practical implications: Accreditation is a critical and complete hospital review, including areas that often are neglected. Accreditation dominates hospital agendas during preparation and surveyor visits, potentially reducing patient care and other QI initiatives. Improvements are less likely to occur in areas that other QI initiatives addressed. Yet, accreditation creates organisational foundations for future QI initiatives.

However, the understanding and application of big data seem rather elusive and only partially explored. The purpose of this paper is to create further guidance in understanding big data and to explore applications from a business process perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a sequential mixed-method. First, a Delphi study was designed to gain insights regarding the terminology of big data and to identify and rank applications of big data in SCM using an adjusted supply chain operations reference (SCOR) process framework. This was followed by a questionnaire-survey among supply chain executives to elucidate the Delphi study findings and to assess the practical use of big data. Findings: First, big data terminology seems to be more about data collection than of data management and data utilization. Second, the application of big data is most applicable for logistics, service and planning processes than of sourcing, manufacturing and return. Third, supply chain executives seem to have a slow adoption of big data. Research limitations/implications: The Delphi study is explorative by nature and the questionnaire-survey rather small in scale; therefore, findings have limited generalizability. Practical implications: The findings can help supply chain managers gain a clearer understanding of the domain of big data and guide them in where to deploy big data initiatives. Originality/value: This study is the first to assess big data in the SCOR process framework and to rank applications of big data as a mean to guide the SCM community to where big data is most beneficial. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Applications; Big data; Business processes; Decision making; Digital strategy; Information technology; Mixed method; Supply chain management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047933973

Before you know, you have changed to this new plan, which not only exceeds your needs, but also “procures” a six-month free subscription to an online music service. You needed neither and pay more: you have just been “phished” as Akerlof and Shiller would say in their recent book Phishing for Phools. Furthermore, their phishing equilibrium dictates that if your company does not phish others will, so you phish to survive. The purpose of this paper is to present a formal analysis of phishing and phishing equilibria with surprising potential benefits to consumers rather than scamsters.

Findings: Being an honest trader may actually, under certain circumstances, be an advantage in a market contrary to Akerlof and Shiller’s thesis Phishing for Phools. Research limitations/implications: Phishing for Phools may have its limitations when viewed from an evolutionary game-theoretical perspective which has positive implications for behavioral finance and significance of a phishing equilibrium in markets populated by honest as well as dishonest traders.

Wicked problems are difficult to solve and continue to negatively influence hospital systems. The proponents of the networked governance approach suggest that a new governance mode embracing a collaborative innovation approach to solving wicked problems has emerged. In the context of hospitals, collaborative innovation refers to mobilising patients for, in collaboration with staff members and other stakeholders, solving wicked hospital problems. The claims put forward by proponents of networked governance have not been assessed in the context of hospitals. This paper reduces this research gap by conducting an analysis of the extent to which Danish hospitals have implemented a collaborative innovation approach involving patients as an innovation asset in a systematic manner. The paper shows that the use of new collaborative innovative techniques involving patients have been embraced, but not for solving wicked problems and not in a systematic manner. The paper suggests that hospitals need to embrace collaborative innovation endeavours and patient involvement in a systematic manner for solving wicked problems.

We respond to the call for a ‘transnational sociology of the professions’ (Faulconbridge and Muzio 2012) that is interested in identifying how professionals forge and maintain markets. Much of this activity comes through professional enterprises that operate in ‘thin’ transnational environments and are decoupled from ‘thick’ domestic environments (Seabrooke 2014). Transnational projects operate in a unique ‘social space’ in that they blend interactions between the national, local, international and transnational (Morgan 2001). As activity is stretched across these levels, it offers room for professionals to push forward and establish markets for their expertise and skills. Professionals create and drive enterprises to make the most of these opportunities, using knowledge and framing strategies to assert their control over professional markets and generate demand for their services within them. Here we outline how professionals use enterprises and their network to pursue knowledge and framing strategies to push forward their transnational projects. Knowledge strategies include knowing how to leverage institutional and organisational fields (Boussebaa, Sturdy and Morgan 2014; Greenwood, Suddaby and Hinings 2002), engaging in ‘epistemic arbitrage’ (Seabrooke 2014) and establishing oneself as an arbiter of appropriate professional knowledge. Framing strategies include disrupting current professional and institutional orders (Vollmer 2013), contesting what is appropriate professional knowledge for transnational issues, and normalising who is best suited to controlling professional jurisdictions within transnational professional projects (Fligstein and McAdam 2012). Both knowledge and framing strategies are examples of ‘institutional work’ done by professionals as they pursue their transnational projects (Lawrence, Suddaby and Leca 2011). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Mike Saks and Daniel Muzio; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046918170

Design/methodology/approach: The study draws on a reflexive dialogical research approach, which means that it is methodologically designed as a critical dialogue between on the one hand an empirical case and on the other hand theories on social media and strategic communication. Findings: The study points toward a fundamental new approach to recruitment communication. The application of a Web 3.0 strategy entails what we term an open source recruitment strategy and a redirection of employee focus from work life to private life. These insights point toward ontologically challenging the basic assumptions of employees, work life and the employing organization. Research limitations/implications: The paper presents a single-case study, which prepares the ground for larger, longitudinal studies. Such studies may apply a more long-term focus on the implications of applying Web 3.0 recruitment strategies and how they may be integrated into – or how they challenge – overall corporate communication strategies. Practical implications: A turn toward Web 3.0 in recruitment communication affects the degree of interactional complexity and the level of managerial control. Furthermore, the authors argue that the utilization of a Web 3.0 strategy in recruitment communication put forth precarious dilemmas and challenges of controllability, controversy, ownership and power relations, demanding organizations to cautiously entering the social media 3.0 employment market. Originality/value: This study indicates how the value and potentials of social media as facilitating participatory processes and community conversations can be strategically used in and fundamentally alter recruitment communication, and hence offers new insights into a paradigmatically new way of understanding what strategic social media recruitment is, can and do. © 2018, Helle Kryger Aggerholm and Sophie Esmann Andersen.","Campaigns; Communication management; Communication strategy; Employee communication; Social media; Strategic communication",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045852633

Ethnographic field work included in-depth interviews and observations in stadiums, fan busses, and fan trains, which were videotaped. The results of the study suggest that the community of football fans shares a lot of similarities with brand communities and (sub) cultures of consumption. Like in other consumption worlds, football clubs provide a basis for identification for football fans that share rituals and escape from everyday role models. Football stadiums, fan busses, and fan trains represent linking places where social relationships can be built and maintained. Loyalty to other fans simultaneously increases loyalty to the club; therefore, clubs should care for opportunities that function as linking places where bonds between individuals can be established. Therefore the traditional economic perspective on a sport event as a team product is less appropriate than the perspective of latest sport management approaches where sport events are regarded as platforms where social actors co-create value. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, James J.

Although these studies have become more common in developed countries, developing countries are lagging behind. In Malaysia, major cities such as Kuala Lumpur (Peninsular Malaysia) and Kuching (Sarawak) have experienced growth and policy makers recognise the importance of their green spaces, but lack comprehensive user studies. This paper presents the results from a comparative study on the use of green spaces and visitor preferences for five selected parks in Kuala Lumpur and Kuching. The study comprised, among others, a survey among residents living within a two kilometre radius of the park boundaries. A total of 1,692 respondents answered the questionnaire. Results show that close to 9 out of 10 people living within a 2 km radius of the studied parks use them for recreational purposes. Most of the respondents visit the parks during weekends and typically travel by car, in spite of the short distance to the park. The study also identified differences in green space usage patterns according to different socio-demographic and economic factors, including ethnicity. Malaysians of Chinese descent, for example, have a greater preference for using parks during the morning compared to Malaysians of Malay and Indian descent. Differences were also found regarding motivations for using the parks. However, various similarities can also be noted, e.g. regarding length of use visiting together with family members. It is important for park management to recognise park use patterns and preferences, in particular also where different groups are concerned. © 2018, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

The insurance scheme is provided by government authority and is designed to help small firms with the financial burden related to sickness absence of their workers. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of firms’ participation in an insurance scheme on the long-term sickness absence of their employees, using administrative records. Design/methodology/approach: To identify potential moral hazard, the authors use IV approach created by the eligibility threshold, in order to identify the true causal effect of sickness insurance on sickness absence of workers. The authors use the eligibility criterion as an instrument for the participation in the insurance scheme. The authors confirm the presence of moral hazard in insured firms. Findings: The authors show that sickness absence in insured firms is much more prevalent than in uninsured firms. Sickness spells in insured firms are shorter and the conditional probability to return back to work from sickness is much higher in insured firms. Practical implications: These results suggest that employees in insured firms are less monitored during the first two weeks and that their sickness is less serious. The authors demonstrate in the paper that the minimum cost of the present insurance scheme is similar to about 1,100 man-years. On top of that comes a substantial cost to more short time sickness. Originality/value: The authors provide additional evidence on this topic using precise administrative spell data combined with socio-economic data. Compared to previous literature, the authors include duration analysis and identify the presence of moral hazard using a Cox proportional hazard model. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Absence; Insurance; Moral hazard; Sickness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045432389

The concept 'invisible work' is used to show that 'what counts as work' is bound up with technologies that are not neutral. Technologies, professionals, and patients implicitly co-constitute innovation processes, and we argue that in order to understand the potential of tacit innovation among health care workers, one must revisit the dichotomy between technology producers and technology end-users. The aim and contribution of this paper is thus to attempt to revitalize the discussion about technology workarounds as initiatives of tacit innovation, thus adding to the theoretical conceptualization of invisible work when technologies are used in health care work. © 2018, Roskilde University.","Actor-network theory; Employee-driven innovation; Health care; Invisible work; Tacit innovation; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045317554

A contingency approach is applied to formulate propositions as to when conventional versus strategic contracting is preferable. Findings: The distinction between conventional and strategic contracting has implications as to whether relational governance substitutes or complements formal contracts (the substitution versus complements perspectives). Strategic contracting results in complementarity (rather than substitutability) between formal contracts and relational governance. Research limitations/implications: This paper argues that a more nuanced view on contract types, such as strategic versus conventional, may reconcile the enduring research controversy between the substitution and complements perspectives. Practical implications: Today, formal contracts with foreign distributors tend to resemble “prenuptial agreements”. The opportunity for relational rent (e.g. manifested in higher export revenues) grows if conventional contracts are superseded by contracts following strategic contracting principles. Originality/value: This study is interdisciplinary, not only by its combination of marketing, management and contractual economics but also through its law and economics amalgamation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Business-to-business marketing; Contracts; Governance; Intermediaries; Partnering; Strategic management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045235799

Design/methodology/approach: The sample of N=597 white-collars in the German media and IT industry is drawn via the professional network XING. Cross-sectional mediator models are used to test the hypothesis. Findings: The processes proposed by the JD-R model find empirical support. Job demands primarily cause exhaustion while job resources increase job satisfaction. Besides, job demands reduce job satisfaction and job resources lead to less exhaustion. An exception is found for cognitive workload which rather acts like a job resource. EO mediates these effects in a favorable way. High job resources foster EO, which in turn reduces exhaustion and enhances job satisfaction. For job demands, EO shows a negative mediation reducing the health-impairment process and increasing job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: Future research should broach the issue of adverse effects related to extreme employee entrepreneurship and potential negative effects. Practical implications: Supporting and supervising an EO may help employees to cope with modern job profiles in agile organizations. Originality/value: The findings provide support for a favorable mediating role of an entrepreneurial personal resource within the JD-R model.

We conducted an event study that employed content analysis and emotion analysis, as well as social set analysis (SSA) of Facebook data to uncover and better understand crowdfunder (investor and customer) engagement and interactions before, during and after a crowdfunding campaign event. Our paper focuses especially on the role of Jolla's tablet crowdfunding campaign in the development of its fanbase in relation with Nokia's tablet launch during Slush 2014 event. On the basis of the above analyses and related literature, we present propositions about various types of engagement with the potential to facilitate the evolution of entrepreneurial ecosystems. We discuss the results and evaluate the implications of crowdfunding on customer engagement for entrepreneurial ecosystems and conclude with directions for future work.

However, until so far there is little empirical evidence for genetically modified food acceptance among Central Asian consumers. This article contributes to existing literature in this field by exploring consumers' acceptance and willingness to pay for genetically modified potatoes in Tajikistan. A dichotomous-choice contingent valuation methodology is used as a primary empirical tool. The data was collected in a major city of Tajikistan. The results indicate that more than half of survey participants are not aware of genetically modified potatoes. Yet, the majority of consumers expressed a positive or neutral opinion about this particular product and for two-third of respondents no risks are associated with genetically modified potatoes. These results highlight that Tajik consumers seem to be less risk-averse towards genetically modified food than consumers in Europe. This study explores consumer preferences for genetically modified potatoes in Tajikistan. A contingent valuation method is applied to measure consumers' willingness to pay for this particular genetically modified product based upon socio-demographic variables as well as predictors related to individuals' attitudes and perceptions.

What is a business model framework with the strategic innovation approach in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) of ICT industry? What are the components of this model and the relations between them? Business model is a logical response to how a business can create value. Changing business environment means that business models are rapidly growing; accordingly, innovation is no longer optional. However, innovation is important in general, but the kind of innovation that is widely and directly dependent on business model will be quite critical for all parts of the organization. In fact, business model innovation is an exquisite technic to create, deliver and earn value by changing one or more components of a typical business model. Business model innovation needs information and form business environment based on dynamic information system. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper focuses upon SMEs in ICT. Grounded theory has been used for this purpose, with 15 interviews conducted. Findings: An emerging market is one in which commercial exchanges of a particular industry between the countries are relatively new but possess great investment attractiveness and a high potential to grow (such as Iran).As the ICT industry of Iran is a leading industry, and the country itself is an emerging market, the main purpose of this study is to provide a framework for designing an innovative information-based business to help fledgling businesses development in the ICT industry of Iran.

While this employee group seems to have a highly constructive influence on the performance of university organizations, some problems in relation to effective inclusion of these individuals have been noted. In order to further advance the theoretical understanding regarding integration efforts in international university organizations, the purpose of this paper is to explore how two types of inclusive management, empowering management (identity-blind) vs English management communication (identity-conscious), affect local and expatriate academics. Design/methodology/approach: Using responses generated from a survey of 792 local and 620 expatriate academics, this paper assesses the effects of inclusive management on job engagement and stress among the two groups. Findings: The results show that one type of inclusive management, empowering management (identity-blind), has a favorable influence on job engagement and stress in both subsamples. The other type, English management communication (identity-conscious), increases stress for local academics but has no effect on the expatriates. These findings are useful for theory development in relation to employee inclusion in international organizations. Originality/value: The authors have little knowledge about how inclusive management functions in international organizations.

A firm can combine RL with forward logistics, keep the flows separated, or choose a position between the two extremes. The purpose of this paper is to identify the contextual factors that determine the most advantageous position, which the paper refers to as the most advantageous degree of combination. Design/methodology/approach – The paper first develops a scale ranging from 0 percent combination to 100 percent combination (i.e. full separation). Second, using the contingency theory the paper identifies the contextual factors described in RL-literature that determine the most advantageous degree of combination. The set of factors is subsequently tested using a case study, which applies a triangulation approach that combines a qualitative and a quantitative method. Findings – The results show six distinct contextual factors that determine the most advantageous degree of combination. Examples of factors are technical product complexity, product portfolio variation, and the loss of product value over time. Practical implications – For practitioners the scale of possible positions and set of contextual factors constitute a decision-making framework. Using the framework practitioners can determine the most advantageous position of the scale for their firm. Originality/value – Much RL-research addresses intra-RL issues while the relationship between forward and RL is under-researched. This paper contributes to RL theory by identifying the contextual factors that determine the most advantageous relationship between forward and RL, and proposes a novel decision-making framework for practitioners. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study research; Conceptual development; Reverse logistics; Reverse supply chain; Supplier relations; Suppliers; Supply chain management",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042489589

The purpose of this paper is to investigate how aspiring entrepreneurs in a Danish rural area setting manage to get embedded into relevant business networks. Before the literature background on social capital and regional development, the authors use the embeddedness approach in explaining whether weak or strong ties are most beneficial to get the business started and how lacking strong ties can be compensated. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes an economic sociology perspective on social capital and is empirically based on a case study. The sample consists of a group of young aspiring entrepreneurs, living in the rural area of Southern Jutland, who are all committed to an organization which supports regional start-ups. Findings: The authors found that aspiring entrepreneurs have different needs depending on their development status and type of innovation. Founders, who are developing or have developed new product innovations, seem to have an increased need for “strong ties” with consultants and those with knowledge about building up a professional network. Founders, who are developing or have developed a significantly improved service, have strong ties with former fellow students and researchers at the university. Originality/value: This study illustrates that aspiring entrepreneurs connected to a regional entrepreneurship center gained access to a wider relevant network. Depending on their level of embeddedness, they could build new strong relationships and exploit information stemming from new “weak ties” and as such harness more benefits. The study shows that less privileged start-ups can substitute strong ties, especially through the support of professional managers of startup-supporting organizations. Finally, a model explaining the impact of social capital on the entrepreneurial sphere of regional business networks and on its innovativeness is deduced. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Aspiring entrepreneurs; Embeddedness; Rural area; Social capital; Weak ties/strong ties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041846304

So far imperative workflow modelling languages have played the major role for the description and analysis of business processes. Despite their undoubted efficacy in representing sequential executions, they hide circumstantial information leading to the enactment of activities, and obscure the rationale behind the verification of requirements, dependencies, and goals. This workshop aimed at providing a platform for the discussion and introduction of new ideas related to the development of a holistic approach that encompasses all those aspects. The objective was to extend the reach of the business process management audience towards the decisions and rules community and increase the integration between different imperative, declarative and hybrid modelling perspectives.

For processes with great variability, the latter approach tends to provide better results, because using an imperative miner would lead to so-called “spaghetti models” which attempt to show all possible paths and are impossible to read. However, studies have shown that one size does not fit all: many processes contain both structured and unstructured parts and therefore do not fit strictly in one category or the other. This has led to the recent introduction of hybrid miners, which aim to combine flow- and constraint-based models to provide the best possible representation of a log. In this paper we focus on a core question underlying the development of hybrid miners: given a log, can we determine a priori whether the log is best suited for imperative or declarative mining? We propose using the concept of entropy, commonly used in information theory. We consider different measures for entropy that could be applied and show through experimentation on both synthetic and real-life logs that these entropy measures do indeed give insights into the complexity of the log and can act as an indicator of which mining paradigm should be used. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Entropy; Hybrid models; Information theory; Knowledge work; Process flexibility; Process mining; Process variability","Administrative data processing; Enterprise resource management; Entropy; Information theory; Miners; Hybrid model; Knowledge work; Process flexibility; Process mining; Process Variability; Data mining",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041716336

Design/methodology/approach: Non-probability sampling was used to recruit a sample of 411 consumers in Southern Chile, over the age of 18 and responsible for the purchase of meat products for their household. Findings: Using a fractional factorial design for conjoint analysis, it was found in the total sample that the meat source of the meat processed product was more important than packaging, region of origin, price and the functional ingredient claim, with preference for lamb and pork meat processed products with omega-3. Two main segments were identified using a cluster analysis; these segments differed according to family size, presence and age of children, ethnic origin, general health interest, quality of diet and level of satisfaction with food-related life. The largest segment (56.0 percent) shows a high preference toward lamb meat processed product with dietary fiber and omega-3.

Practical implications: A differentiated marketing strategy with different meat sources and functional ingredients may give access to a large market share. People more willing to accept different functional ingredients in processed meat products may enjoy a better quality of life. The level of satisfaction with food-related life and quality of diet can be useful in explaining preferences for functional meat processed products. Originality/value: This is the first study to evaluate consumer acceptance of a functional meat processed product made with three different meats and three different functional ingredient claims, which analyzed the relationship between acceptance, the consumer’s quality of diet and their level of satisfaction with food-related life. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cold meat; Consumer segments; Functional foods; Health; Sausages meat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041622532

Design/methodology/approach: This study of FM services in Denmark consists of an explorative case study and three case studies of FM clients. Both phases, related and overlapping, involved collection and analysis of in-depth, semi-structured interviews and archive data. Findings: Findings show that business model innovation entails interorganisational collaboration across different phases of the innovation process. The research demonstrates that external orientation within FM service ecosystems involves both a reaction to changes in the external environment and the proactive involvement of stakeholders throughout business model innovation. Research limitations/implications: The selection of business model innovation processes was limited to the Danish context. The sample, although heterogeneous and representative, represented only a fraction of the total population, which may have excluded processes of business model innovation that contradict the research. Practical implications: This paper suggests that by observing the business models of the value network over time, organisations could learn from the interdependencies between intra- and interorganisational stakeholders, thereby supporting the monitoring of risks and uncertainties as well as the anticipation of potential consequences of changes in the ecosystem.

The ability of a knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) provider to formulate value propositions into attractive offerings to varied customers becomes a competitive advantage. In this specific business based on often highly abstract service offerings, this requires the provider to have a clear overview of its knowledge and resources and how these can be configured to obtain the desired customization of services. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how a KIBS provider can match value propositions with varied customer needs utilizing service modularity. To accomplish this purpose, a qualitative multiple case study is organized around 5 projects allowing within-case and cross-case comparisons. Our findings describe how through the configuration of knowledge and resources a sustainable competitive advantage is created through creating the right kind of value propositions for varied customers with the help of modularity.

Principal component analysis is used to reduce the TRL instrument's 69 items to 18 dimensions within five lifestyle components. Based on multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, it is found that the instrument possesses metric, but not scalar (measurement) invariance across the 10 countries. Multilevel latent class analysis is used to classify participants to TRL segments and to classify the 10 countries into groups with similar segment structure. The final solution has six TRL segments and two country classes, which are profiled in terms of relevant background characteristics. Finally, a multivariate GLM analysis reveals that three behavioral tendencies of importance for transport-related environmental impacts vary significantly and substantially between lifestyle segments: vehicle ownership, everyday travel-mode choice and environmentally-friendly transport innovativeness. Further, when differences in transport-related lifestyles are controlled, country (cluster) of residence as well as the interaction between lifestyle and country (cluster) of residence also influence these three behavioral tendencies. In conclusion, the usefulness of transport-related lifestyle segmentation as a tool for transport planners and campaigners is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,"Environmental impact; Factor analysis; Cognitive approaches; Confirmatory factor analysis; European Countries; Innovativeness; Latent class analysis; Transport planners; Travel mode choices; Vehicle ownership; Multivariant analysis; lifestyle; principal component analysis; transportation mode; travel behavior; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040789609

The intention to consume more sustainable is no exception and often fails to be translated into behaviour. Behavioural research emphasized the use of nudges as one of the remedies to ensure that most of the people's daily choices on what to buy or what to eat end up being in their best interest. The behavioural economics literature usually focusses on interventions supporting automatic and unconscious processes, mostly being the result of cognitive shortcuts produced by System 1 (e.g., by setting better default options or making existing contexts more intuitive and easy to handle). However, this begs the question, what consumers themselves can do to ensure a consumption behaviour that is more in line with their pro-environmental intentions? This article explores a possible ‘self-nudging’ strategy of consumers signing up for an organic box scheme subscription, whereby they change a large number of small daily choices to a larger decision on exclusively getting organic groceries delivered to their doorstep. It does so based on qualitative in-depth interviews with 10 customers of such an organic box scheme. The analysis reveals that signing up for the subscription scheme indeed means that low-involvement decisions in regular supermarkets are replaced by a high-involvement decision on subscribing to an organic box scheme. In this context of the organic box scheme, the self-nudging phenomenon is in fact the active choice of consumers to set their default consumption option to ‘organic’ in the long run. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","consumer decision making; intention-behaviour gap; organic; qualitative; self-nudging; sustainable food choice",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040119006

Design/methodology/approach: Three global manufacturing corporations from the automotive sector are used as a strategic sample composing three sequential clinical research projects. The data come from complementary data-gathering methods combining documents and interviews and workshops with top executives, project leaders, platform managers and product brand managers, thus enabling triangulation. Findings: The study shows that managing manufacturing corporations with multiple brands is not just on a scale between full specialization and full commonalization but instead has its own logic of categorizations and portfolio formations. In order to develop the value of the brand portfolio, management must simultaneously embrace and address a number of highly integrated corporate values and highly differentiated brand company values. Research limitations/implications: This study contributes primarily by relating economy of scale in relation to the need for differentiation of products and brands that have different values, customers and market positions. A model for balancing commonalization and specialization provides several opportunities for further research and development; however, generalizations are issue and context specific. Practical implications: The critical issues in balancing how to deal with specialization and commonalization in a company with multiple brands are explored and summarized in a framework for the practitioner to use in analyzing a real situation. Originality/value: Previous literature focuses on the maximization of synergies within one brand, missing the specific dynamics of large manufacturing corporations with many entities, such as individual products and brands.

Given the rapid growth in meat production in Brazil for domestic consumption and international export, the link between LUC emissions and consumption of pork and poultry meat is central to evaluating the role of Brazilian meat production and the implications for international climate policies. In this paper, we first estimate LUC emissions from soybean production destined to feed pork and poultry in Brazil during the period 2008–2012. Second, we allocate such emissions to domestic and international consumption of pork and poultry meat. Concerning international consumption, Brazilian export of meat to 189 countries is evaluated. Although the majority of the LUC emissions from soybean production are tied to the domestic consumption, 17% and 39% of the emissions embodied in Brazilian pork and poultry, respectively, are exported to other countries. The most prominent destinations of Brazilian pork and poultry in terms of embodied LUC emissions are Eastern Europe, Asia and South America. In the case of pork, the fluxes of emissions from Brazil to Ukraine (1.28 Mt CO2-eq) and Russia (1.18 Mt CO2-eq) are particularly large. In the case of poultry, the largest transfers of embodied emissions are from Brazil to developing countries and especially the Middle East. These results are relevant to environmental policies and international agreements aimed at achieving the sustainability of Brazil's meat sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emissions; International trade; Land-use change; Soybean; Sustainable development","Economics; Environmental management; Metabolism; Physiology; Planning; Strategic planning; Surveys; Urban planning; Economic activities; Economic viability; Environmental performance; Local authorities; SWOT analysis; Tourist activities; Tourist and environment; Tourist destinations; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038820452

However, these prescriptions are overly simplistic and largely based on anecdotal evidence that fails to account for context. The purpose of this paper is to explore the design decisions taken by organizations in support of servitization. Design/methodology/approach: A large-scale exploratory case study was conducted, consisting of embedded cases in three divisions of a UK-based, global manufacturing firm. Findings: Each division provided different combinations of offerings (i.e. product-, use- and result-oriented). The findings suggest that front-end/back-end configurations differ according to the offering and can exist concurrently within the same organization, challenging the assumption that different configurations within an organization are not possible. The findings show that underlying contextual factors, such as the complexity and temporality of the offering, as well as the power of the customer, have implications for the structuring of servitizing organizations. Research limitations/implications: This is a context-specific, qualitative case study conducted within a large original equipment manufacturer, yet the findings are analytically generalized. Originality/value: In identifying the relevance of different design decisions in terms of customer contact, decoupling of activities and grouping of employees, the findings challenge the extant view that organizations simply split activities between the front- and back-end functions. The research identifies an additional design configuration – integrated project teams – involving a dominant customer dictating organizational interfaces. This research exposes the need for further investigation into how to organize for servitization in project-based contexts. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Case study; Front- and back-end units; Integrated project teams (IPTs); Organizational design; Servitization; Solutions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038820101

Second, we shed light on the fuzzy role of entrepreneurial expertise for effectuation. Our study is based on a sample of entrepreneurs (N = 560) and a comparison group of non-entrepreneurs (N = 351). We employed a scenario-based questionnaire to examine participants' causal and effectual decision-making. Our ordered logit models reveal that German entrepreneurs use effectual decision-making more often – despite their image of causal and predictive business planning. Surprisingly, the level of entrepreneurial expertise did not influence this tendency. Hence, the role of entrepreneurial expertise and deliberate practice in effectuation theory has to be rethought.

The increased engagement of private business in what was a public-dominated incubation landscape may influence established theoretical frameworks. Within this context, this paper analyses 11 German business incubators to look at the most common types of for-profit business incubators in Germany and their main characteristics. Moreover, it introduces classification criteria for these incubators. Another aspect of the analysis is the effect of the triple helix dimensions of the different incubation types. The results show that two additional types of incubators can be identified in addition to the traditional public business incubator model, namely 'company builders' and 'accelerators'. Implications for research and practice, as well as directions for future research, are also discussed.

Moreover, incubators and accelerators arise to support and complement fast growing global economy through entrepreneurial activities. Since entrepreneurship education seems to be important for economic development, the development of entrepreneurship education and effective teaching methods are discussed. For this, one university in Germany and one university in Denmark were chosen and researched with ten interviews. The structured comparison of teaching activities and methods indicates several interesting insights. Differences in organisation, structure and teaching methods between both universities could be identified, as well as similar developments concerning entrepreneurship education in general. Both universities do research in the field of entrepreneurship, offer related programmes for bachelor and master students and focus the study programmes on practical experiences, experimental teaching and the involvement of guest lecturers. In addition to that, they offer cross-faculty electives and extra-curricular activities to connect students from different faculties and provide the opportunity to network with investors, support organisations and participate in a business plan competition.

Universities have to compete for additional financial means, while companies, particularly in high technology business environments, are facing a stronger pressure to innovate. Universities seek to deal with this situation by academic engagement, hereby providing external research support for businesses. Relying on the market segmentation approach, promoting beneficial exchange relations between academia and businesses enables the integration of both perspectives and may contribute to solving current challenges. Transferring the segmentation approach and the customer benefit perspective to university-business collaboration (UBC), this paper develops a multi-step segmentation framework aimed at identifying research customer segments in technical textile industries in Western Europe.

In this article, we stress the utility of visual participatory research (VPR) methods in B&S research to fill this gap. Through a case study on engaging Ghanaian cocoa farmers on gender inequality issues, we explore how VPR methods may be used by researchers to achieve more inclusive, and thus more credible, stakeholder research that can improve decision making within businesses. Furthermore, we argue that ingrained social and environmental problems tackled by B&S research and the unique context in which they occur may open up new opportunities to develop participatory visual methods for social change. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.","corporate social responsibility; drawing; fringe stakeholders; participatory methods; visual methods",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037654112

We examine how five aspects of internal public management affect individuals’ perception of MTW: (a) setting challenging but feasible goals, (b) making credible commitments, (c) encouraging employee participation, (d) providing frequent performance feedback, and (e) rewarding employees who perform well. We find positive effects of the “credible commitment” and “performance feedback” treatments on overall MTW perception.

KWM spans a variety of different contexts which have rarely been explored in prior research. We focus on advancing our understanding of KWM in context, pushing the boundaries of theory and methods by developing a framework focusing on five main contextual dimensions: organizational context and roles, geographical and spatial context, social context and teams, institutional and cultural norms, and temporal dynamics.

We find that spin-offs hiring co-workers from the parent firm survive longer. This survival bonus is greater in pushed-driven start-ups. We investigate two different mechanisms through which co-worker mobility may improve spin-off survival – knowledge transfer and reduced searching costs. While both mechanisms play a role in explaining the survival bonus in pulled spin-offs, co-worker mobility seems to help pushed spin-offs to survive mostly by reducing initial recruitment costs.

Based on a qualitative research approach, combining in-store observations and focus group interviews, and focusing on three environmental variables in the servicescape: ambient conditions, space and functions, and signs, symbols and artifacts, the results indicate that consumers’ behavior and perceptions differ when there are doors or no doors on cabinets. The results further show how doors lead to different forms of approach or avoidance behavior in terms of accessibility and that consumers’ vision, olfaction and tactility all influence consumers’ perceptions of freshness and cleanliness in relation to doors or no doors.

We present an experimental study with industrial costing and bidding experts from the defence and aerospace sector. The study consisted of an experimental set-up via two questionnaires which differed in the existence of competition in the bidding scenario. The findings showed that bidding decision makers changed their evaluation of the cost estimate due to the introduction of competition but kept their evaluations of the profit margin and price bids constant. Furthermore, the participants listed the relevant sources of uncertainty that influenced their decision-making process. This research contributes to the literature in two ways.

However, there is a gap in knowledge how to take the efficacious measures, which makes it difficult for the stakeholders of shipping activities to promote green shipping. In order to fill this gap, this chapter proposed a generic methodology for establishing a criterion evaluation system for greenness assessment of shipping, including the identification of the success factors, the development of some strategic measures, and the analysis of the measures for enhancing the greenness of shipping. A criterion evaluation system which consists of multiple criteria in five aspects including: technological aspect, economic aspect, environmental aspect, social aspect, and managerial aspect has been firstly established. Subsequently, Analytic Network Process (ANP) has been employed to determine the relative importance of these factors in green shipping with the consideration of the interdependences and interactions among these criteria for evaluating the greenness of shipping, and they have been ranked from the most important to the least. Accordingly, the key success factors for green shipping have been obtained. Then, some strategic measures for helping the stakeholders enhance the greenness of shipping have been proposed. Finally, Interpretative Structuring Modeling (ISM) has been employed to analyze the cause-effect relationships among these measures and the features of these measures. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Analytic network process; Green shipping; Interpretative structuring modeling; Structural self-interaction matrix; Success factors",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032444478

In recent years, several data mining based methods have been designed for discovering interesting patterns in event logs. A popular type of methods consists of applying frequent itemset mining to extract patterns indicating how resources and activities are frequently used. Although these methods are useful, they have two important limitations. First, these methods are designed to be applied to original event logs. Because these methods do not consider other perspectives on the data that could be obtained by applying data transformations, many patterns are missed that may represent important information for businesses. Second, these methods can generate a large number of patterns since they only consider the minimum support as constraint to select patterns. But analyzing a large number of patterns is time-consuming for users, and many irrelevant patterns may be found. To address these issues, this paper presents an improved event log analysis approach named AllMining. It includes a novel pre-processing method to construct multiple types of transaction databases from a same original event log using transformations. This allows to extract many new useful types of patterns from event logs with frequent itemset mining techniques. To address the second issue, a pruning strategy is further developed based on a novel concept of pattern coverage, to present a small set of patterns that covers many events to decision makers. Results of experiments on real-life event logs show that the proposed approach is promising compared to existing frequent itemset mining approaches and state-of-the-art process model algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Business process analysis; Event logs; Pattern mining; Process mining","Decision making; Business process analysis; Data transformation; Event logs; Frequent itemset mining; Pattern mining; Pre-processing method; Process mining; Transaction database; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032276961

A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the compositions of the aqueous and oil phases was achieved by the combination of liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and total organic carbon (TOC). Close to 100% of the organic carbon in the aqueous phase was explained by the monomers phthalic acid and dipropylene glycol, co-solvent acetone, and a secondary reaction product, isophorone. In the oil, the most abundant compounds were isophorone, 3,3,6,8-tetramethyl-1-tetralone, and dihydroisophorone. While the first two compounds were intermediates in the self-condensation of acetone, dihydroisophorone has not been reported previously as the by-product of the conventional acetone self-condensation reaction pathway. The quantification results have shown that solvolysis can be successfully used to close the loop in the polymer life cycle while producing a broad spectrum of high-value products that could be recycled for production of polymers, used as a building blocks, or as fine chemicals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Glass fiber reinforced composite; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Recycling; Solvolysis; Unsaturated polyester","Acetone; Carbon; Chromatography; Condensation; Condensation reactions; Electrodeposition; Electrospray ionization; Fiber reinforced plastics; Gel permeation chromatography; Ionization of liquids; Life cycle; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Organic carbon; Polymers; Reaction intermediates; Recycling; Solvents; Spectrometry; Unsaturated polymers; Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; Gel permeation chromatography (GPC); Glass fiber reinforced composite; Quantitative evaluation; Solvolysis; Unsaturated polyester; Unsaturated polyester resin; Value-added chemicals; Polyester resins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032021421

Such outsourcing has often resulted in complex supply chain configurations. Because social and environmental regulations in those countries are often weak or poorly enforced, stakeholders impose responsibility on focal companies to ensure socially and environmentally sustainable production standards throughout their supply chains. In this paper, we present an integrated fuzzy AHP-VIKOR approach-based framework for sustainable global supplier selection that takes sustainability risks from sub-suppliers (i.e., (1+n)th-tier suppliers) into account. Sustainability criteria (including risk concerns) were identified from the existing literature and were further narrowed with the assistance of field experts and case decision makers to remove any literature bias. Then, based on the finalized sustainability criteria, suppliers and sub-suppliers were evaluated altogether. In previous studies, this approach was limited. The problem is addressed in two stages as follows. In the first stage, fuzzy AHP is used to generate criteria weights for sustainable global supplier selection, and in the second stage, fuzzy VIKOR is used to rate supplier performances against the evaluation criteria. Among five sustainability criteria (economic, quality, environment, social, and global risk), economic criteria demonstrated the greatest weight and global risk displayed the least weight. This result clearly shows that global risks are still not considered a major criterion for supplier selection. Further, the proposed framework may serve as a starting point for developing managerial decision-making tools to help companies more effectively address sustainability risks occurring further upstream in their supply chains. These vital tools are particularly important if focal companies are under intense scrutiny by their stakeholders. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy VIKOR; Global supply chain management; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-tier suppliers; Risk mitigation; Sustainable supplier selection","Decision making; Environmental regulations; Hierarchical systems; Supply chain management; Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy VIKOR; Global supply chain management; Multi criteria decision making; Multi-tier; Risk mitigation; Sustainable supplier selections; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032019214

In order to improve performance in line with expectations, Purchasing and Supply Organizations (PSOs) have to evolve continuously. To help address this challenge, a comprehensive contingency framework of PSO structures is presented. The framework is based on existing literature on PSO contingency factors as well as analysis of two case companies. The findings highlight the importance of taking a contingency perspective for understanding the PSO and combining a detailed view of macro-level structural dimensions with micro-level characteristics. These macro-level dimensions comprise category, business unit, geography and activity. The micro-level characteristics comprise centralization, formalization, specialization, participation and standardization. From a theoretical perspective, the contingency framework opens up insights that can be leveraged in future studies in the fields of hybrid PSOs, global sourcing organizations, and International Purchasing Offices (IPOs). From a practical standpoint, an assessment of external and internal contingencies and their relation to specific structural dimensions and characteristics provides the opportunity for more consciously evolving the PSO to continue to improve PSM's contribution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Case study research; Center of excellence; Centralization; Contingency theory; Design; Global; Hybrid; Line function; Local; Procurement; Purchasing; Purchasing and Supply Organization (PSO); Sourcing; Staff function; Structure; Supply management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031315730

The strategy is formulaic, and the net effect is a curious one, which the authors refer to as the scenario planning paradox. Contributing fresh theory supposedly attends to the “dismal” state of theory, while contributing new typologies purportedly helps bring order to methodological chaos. Repeated over time, the contribution strategy breaks down. Effort to resolve the theoretical and methodological issue, which motivates re-statement of the claim in the first place, ultimately fails. In actuality, the field is distanced from its purported goals. The “dismal” state of theory encourages scholars to adopt theory that is not necessarily tethered to a common core, which does not contribute to a shared, foundational theoretical perspective in futures studies. Perceived chaos gives way to typologies, which, as they mount, contribute to the chaos they were meant to resolve. The end result, intended by no one, is that theory remains dismal and methods remain chaotic. This direction for the field is indefensible and untenable; either the field accepts this claim as a statement of truth, for which the solution is substantially enhanced empiricism, or rejects the claim and re-interprets the bounty produced by said claim to be a kind of richness in theory and method rather than the implicit paucity, poverty, and imperfection that they oft signify to the field now. © 2017","Dismal theory; Methodological chaos; Scenario planning","future prospect; planning system; scenario analysis; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031115261

We study this paradox, where a discourse of resistance becomes a productive part of entrepreneurial culture, by way of a case study of a successful startup. We analyze the manner in which people working in the startup utilize ‘doublethink’ to portray the organization both as resistance to an assumed, more corporate, ‘Other’ and also as a budding corporation unto itself. By doing so, we highlight how a discourse of resistance works as a value in entrepreneurship culture as well as a productive element of the same.

Despite acknowledging that ‘no project is an island’ project management theory (being originally a child of Scientific Management) has drawn on reductionism, i.e. the practice of simplifying the description of a complex phenomenon in order to better grasp it. Project stakeholder management theory has been heavily influenced by this approach, and the unintended consequence is that the simplicity of the stakeholder conceptualization makes it difficult for project representatives to predict stakeholder behavior. In the paper, we suggest the concept ‘shadows of the context’ as a substitute for narrow perceptions of ‘What's in it for me?’. Advantages and disadvantages of a reductionist approach versus the richer and more profound and holistic ‘shadows of the context’ approach within stakeholder analysis are discussed.

At the same time, firms still need to achieve economic viability and retain their competitive advantage. Because suppliers are the first entity and the initial source of any supply chain, organisations should select their suppliers by a careful evaluation of their critical success factors (CSF). Achieving a successful sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) strategy requires a firm to consider its stakeholders’ views. Based on the CSF theory and by considering the multi-stakeholders’ view in a sustainability perspective, this work provides a decision support system for the sustainable supplier selection (SSS) problem in a real world textile industry located in the emerging economy of India. Through a three-phase methodology, this study examines Indian suppliers by considering the sustainability views of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, researchers, shareholders, and a government environmental officer. The CSF priorities show that the first four influential CSFs are categorized as social concerns (i.e., maintaining long-term relationships and alliances, stakeholder empowerment, equity labour sources, and individual human rights). The fifth factor is an environmental issue (i.e., production of polluting agents). Among the five suppliers being evaluated in this work, Supplier 4 receives the top ranking. Specifically, the results show that the supplier rankings are highly influenced by CSF's social dimensions. Hence, to validate the influence of CSF's social dimensions in relation to the SSS process, a sensitivity analysis has been done by varying the respective weights. The study concludes with the relevant managerial implications and limitations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","ANP; COPRAS-G; Critical success factor; Fuzzy Delphi; ISM; Multi criteria decision making; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable supplier selection; Triple bottom line","Artificial intelligence; Competition; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Enterprise resource planning; Environmental protection; Industrial economics; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Textile industry; COPRAS-G; Critical success factor; Fuzzy Delphi; Multi criteria decision making; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable supplier selections; Triple Bottom Line; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021973076

In recent years, two important developments have influenced this field: (1) the study and practice of projects have extended their level of analysis from mainly focussing on individual projects to focussing on micro- as well as macro-level concerns around projects; and (2) there has been a greater interest in different kinds of scholarly inquiry. Taken together, these two developments call for closer scrutiny of how the levels of analysis and the types of inquiry are related and benefit each other, and of the explanations of project practices they could offer. To discuss avenues for future research on projects and project practice, this paper suggests the notion of project studies to better grasp the status of our field. We combine these two sets of ideas to analyse the status and future options for advancing project research: (1) levels of analysis; and (2) type of research. Analysing recent developments within project studies, we observe the emergence of what we refer to as type 3 research, which reconciles the need for theoretical development and engagement with practice. Type 3 research suggests pragmatic avenues to move away from accepted yet unhelpful assumptions about projects and project organising. The paper ends with an agenda for future research, which offers project scholars a variety of options to position themselves in the field of project studies, and to explore opportunities in the crossroads between levels of analysis and types of research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA","Levels of analysis; Project management; Project organising; Project studies; Research; Scholarship; Sociology of science","Complex networks; Management science; Problem solving; Project management; Research; Levels of analysis; Project organising; Project studies; Scholarship; Sociology of science; Computer supported cooperative work; project management; research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021751910

Experimental evidence further emphasizes the difference between verbal and material rewards, and this study therefore analyzes real-world public managers’ use of these different rewards and their employees’ perceptions of a governance initiative. This enables us to shed light on a mechanism through which rewards can be connected to motivation. Can rewards contribute to a supportive perception of governance initiatives and potentially crowd-in motivation? This is analyzed in a multi-level dataset with 82 Danish school principals and their 1,273 employees. Managers’ use of contingent verbal rewards is positively associated with employees’ perceptions of the relevant governance initiative, while the corresponding association between material rewards and employee perceptions is weak and statistically insignificant when controlling for other types of managerial behavior. Although the findings need to be tested in an experimental design, they suggest that verbal rewards are a promising tool for public managers.

Consistently with recent advances in the literature, we argue that multiple technological trajectories can coexist in a field; therefore, firms may contribute to technological development by recombining in novel ways the capabilities that are widespread in the field, or by building novel and rare capabilities. The paper also conceptualises how technological uncertainty affects the value of such capabilities. Using patent data from 1977 to 2007 for firms developing the hydrocracking technology, the paper finds that both rare and widespread capabilities are valuable to the invention process, thereby suggesting that both path-dependent and path-creating strategies are beneficial for technological development. The paper shows that uncertainty has an inverted U-shaped effect on invention value. In particular, under conditions of low uncertainty, path-dependent capabilities tend to be more valuable. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.","mature technology; patent value; Path-dependence; rarity; uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018805968

This article develops and tests the argument that this variation to some extent can be traced to the degree of bureaucratic politicization in a polity. A politicized bureaucracy offers politicians greater opportunities to demand from bureaucrats—and raises incentives for bureaucrats to supply—public policy knowledge that is strategically biased or suppressed in a manner that benefits incumbents reputationally. Due to electoral competition, we suggest that the link between bureaucratic politicization and politicized policy knowledge will be stronger in democracies than in autocracies.

The way food is produced, processed, transported, and consumed has a great impact on whether sustainability is achieved throughout the whole food supply chain. Due to the complexity that persists in coordinating the members of food supply chain, food wastage has increased over the past few years. To achieve sustainable consumption and production (SCP), food industry stakeholders need to be coordinated and to have their views reflected in an optimized manner. However, not much research has been done concerning the influence of stakeholders and supply chain members’ coordination in the food industry's SCP context. To facilitate the theory development for SCP, in this work, a short literature review on sustainable supply chain management and sustainable supply chains in the food industry is provided to give the reader current knowledge on how the past and current research are introduced in this work. Following that, different theories that drive sustainable consumption and production have been identified and focused. As a result, theories like the institutional theory, dynamic capability theory, and stakeholder theory are presented. Additionally, a conceptual framework has been developed by identifying the indicators, drivers, and barriers based on the stakeholder theory to achieve the SCP in food supply chain. Finally, limitations and future scope are discussed. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Conceptual framework; Food supply chain; Sustainable consumption and production; Theory development","Research and development management; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Conceptual frameworks; Dynamic capabilities; Institutional theory; Literature reviews; Stakeholder theory; Sustainable consumption; Sustainable supply chains; Theory development; Food supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016412254

In particular, scholars have expressed the fear that public managers, in order to secure high production performance, are forced to sacrifice performance on goals like equity, accountability, and procedural justice. However, our knowledge of whether such trade-offs exist is scarce. Using an administrative 10-year panel data set of Danish public schools and principals, this article analyzes trade-offs between production performance (measured by student performance and student pass rate) and process performance (measured by equity, accountability, and procedural justice). Results show no evidence of trade-offs. In contrast, principals who succeed in raising student performance generally also succeed in securing high pass rates, high equity, high accountability, and high procedural justice. These results suggest that managers who are able to secure high performance on one dimension of performance will likely also be high-performing on other performance dimensions.

Although transformational leadership predicts change in none of the outcomes for immigrants, it does predict change in job satisfaction and well-being for native Danes. Based on our findings, we suggest applying a combination of universalistic and contingency paradigms when leading composite employee groups. © 2016 Cambridge University Press and Australian and New Zealand Academy of Management.","global leadership; immigrants; transformational leadership; universality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014537804

Novices are usually young academics building their careers through publishing. Publishing is challenging if facilitation and opportunities for data collection are limited. To address this challenge, this paper suggests autoethnography as a framework for addressing difficulties that novices face in conducting research and publishing on PSMs. This suggestion grows out of a literature study on autoethnography and PSMs combined with reflections on the author's experience as a PSM novice and young academic. Autoethnography is presented as a means to enable access to real-world interventions, enhance novices' confidence, and identify research and publishing opportunities. The author outlines strengths and challenges associated with PSM novices carrying out autoethnography. Contributions to PSM literature and practice are also provided.

Outside of the leadership literature, managers are also the typical survey respondents in public management studies. An alternative perspective on management can be provided by subordinates’ perceptions of what management is doing. Surveys of subordinates and of managers each pose potential advantages and potential disadvantages when it comes to measuring management, and each approach is likely to prove more fruitful for measuring certain management functions. Using a unique data set of parallel surveys on management with managers and their subordinates as respondents, we examine the differences and relationships between Danish school managers’ and teachers’ perceptions of management functions and the implications of such relationships for organizational performance. We find a surprisingly low correlation between manager and teacher responses regarding the same management functions. Teacher responses are better predictors of student performance for management aspects that are visible to and mediated by teachers. However, manager responses better predict performance for manager expectations that are less visible to employees.

The majority of empirical studies use emotion to describe the experiences of identity work. In doing so, the authors (a) mention the emotions that people feel in situations that trigger identity work, (b) illustrate identity work as an emotional endeavour, and (c) describe the emotional impact of successful and unsuccessful identity work. There is also an emerging literature that examines the mutual constitution of emotions and identity work. These authors address emotional labour, affective social identification, emotional attachment and detachment, and humour when studying identity work. This paper suggests that, to understand better the relation between emotions and identity work, future research should examine the role of emotions in problematizing identity, the emotional constitution of the identity work experience, the intersection of emotions and other ways of knowing the self, and the links between emotions and power in identity work. © 2016 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992129677

Care work for the elderly is a low-paid and low-status occupation, affected by the stigma connected with elderly bodies. Drawing on an ethnographic case study of a homecare unit, this article shows how the adoption of a new distanced, goal-oriented approach to elderly bodies attempts to transform professional identities, and how care work is constructed as reflexive and change oriented, in contrast to emotional and relational approaches. This transformation potentially leads to a more advantageous position for care workers in gendered professional hierarchies. Simultaneously this process seems to render care workers' own bodies more visible, problematizing what are perceived as uncontrolled and unhealthy care worker bodies. The article thus argues that rehabilitative eldercare leads to an intertwining of two forms of bodywork, where work on the care worker's own body and the elderly body mutually constitute each other in a novel body–body articulation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","body work; care work; homecare; professional identity; rehabilitation","elderly care; ethnography; health worker; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959095612
