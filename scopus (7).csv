The optimization of the network quality experienced by end-users requires detailed knowledge of the expected network performance. Also, the achieved service quality is affected by a number of factors, including network operator and available technologies. However, most studies focusing on measuring the cellular network do not consider the performance implications of network configuration and management. To this end, this paper reports about an extensive data set of cellular network measurements, focused on analyzing root causes of mobile network performance variability. Measurements conducted over four weeks in a 4G cellular network in Germany show that management and configuration decisions have a substantial impact on the performance. Specifically, it is observed that the association of mobile devices to a Point of Presence (PoP) within the operator's network can influence the end-to-end RTT by a large extent. Given the collected data a model predicting the PoP assignment and its resulting RTT leveraging Markov Chain and machine learning approaches is developed. RTT increases of 58% to 73% compared to the optimum performance are observed in more than 57% of the measurements. © 2015 IFIP.",,"Artificial intelligence; Internet telephony; Learning systems; Markov processes; Mobile devices; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network performance; Telecommunication networks; Video streaming; Wireless networks; Cellular services; Machine learning approaches; Measurement-based; Mobile applications; Network configuration; Network qualities; Number of factors; Optimum performance; Quality of service",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964042564

Empirical findings are based on a series of semi-structured interviews with four major engineering companies in Northern Europe. We present why they were motivated to use RD, how it has been implemented and currently applied. Success factors for solving implementation challenges are also presented and the experienced effects of adopting it are described. The key findings are: (1) Training, roles, and responsibilities: All companies have given substantial training to their engineers and have implemented new roles with technical responsibility, (2) RD implementation is context dependent: The four case companies have all been successful in using RD but with quite different approaches, depending on, for example, their organisational culture, and (3) Not just management commitment, but also true management competencies in RD are essential for a successful implementation.

We here present a systematic review of existing tools to measure eHealth literacy and for what these tools have been used to investigate. We identified eight tools, of which three of them are bases upon a conceptual model of eHealth literacy and the remaining five are dual tools, i.a. comprised of individual measures for health literacy and digital literacy. Of these eight tools, only one tool (The eHealth literacy Scale - eHEALS) was used in other studies than the one it was originally published in. eHEALS has primarily been used to establish eHealth literacy levels in different populations. Five of the studies have been conducted by examining eHealth literacy's impact on health outcomes, and one study has established an association between high eHealth literacy levels and increased likelihood of attending colorectal cancer screenings in a Japanese population. The two other concept-based tools, eHLS and PRE-HIT, reflect an elaborated understanding of eHealth literacy. The five dual tools were primarily used to screen for adequate and inadequate health literacy and digital literacy. In conclusion, there is very little knowledge about individuals' eHealth literacy and how it relates to health outcomes or the clinical course of specific diseases. New tools developed for the new age of social media and new technologies should be used as eHEALS may have some limitations.","Digital services; eHealth; Literacy; Measurements; Technology",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000623671

The aim of this study was to develop a new conceptualisation of e-health literacy with consideration of the experiences of a wide range of stakeholders and in alignment with current technologies. Concept mapping was used to generate a comprehensive and grounded model of e-health literacy. Concept mapping workshop participants included patients, health professionals and medical informatics experts. Eight workshops, carried out in Denmark and United Kingdom, generated 450 statements, separated into 128 clusters. Through an inductive structured analysis, seven domains were identified: 1. Ability to process information, 2. Engagement in own health, 3. Ability to engage actively with digital services, 4. Feeling safe and in control, 5. Motivation to engage with digital services, 6. Having access to systems that work, and 7. Digital services that suit individual needs. These empirically derived domains form an e-health literacy framework (eHLF) and provide new insights into the user's ability to understand, access and use e-health technologies. The eHLF offers a framework for evaluating an individual's or a population's capacity to understand, use and benefit from technology to promote and maintain their health. Such a framework also provides a potential checklist for the development and improvement of e-health services.","e-Health; Framework; Interaction; Literacy; Technology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000399026

The establishment of measurable environmental performance indicators for the product development process is often cited as a successful factor for effective ecodesign implementation, since it enables setting targets and monitoring achievements towards the accomplishment of environmental ambitions. However, companies still face difficulties in the selection and application of environmental performance indicators – a more structured approach is still lacking. This paper presents the efforts made to identify and systematize existing leading product-related environmental performance indicators, based on a systematic literature review, and to develop a guide to support the selection of these indicators by manufacturing companies. From the review, 261 environmental performance indicators were identified and systematized in a digital database. The database supports the application of the environmental performance indicators guide, which proposes a five-step approach to support the selection of indicators. Based on improvement opportunities identified from a case study for theory-testing in Denmark, an improved version of the guide was developed and subsequently applied in a case study in Brazil. The results from both evaluations indicate that the guide supported the studied companies in the selection of environmental performance indicators in the context of ecodesign implementation.

This article aims to bridge this gap, map the current state of lean in healthcare and identify future research directions. Key concepts of lean thinking are introduced, and the current body of knowledge between 2002 and 2014 is explored to answer key research questions on the application of lean in different healthcare settings. Further, this article is one of the first attempts to classify healthcare services according to the service process matrix. Results show that different healthcare services pose unique challenges to lean implementation due to their inherent characteristics of service delivery. Research opportunities exist to determine the appropriate path which a hospital should follow while implementing lean, to identify the most appropriate set of lean tools and for empirically validating the benefits of lean. © 2015, © 2015 IMI.","future research agenda; healthcare; healthcare service classification; Lean operations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958243878

Over the past 30 years a number of methods for mapping recreational and social values have been developed and implemented in the Nordic countries, in dialogue between research and urban planning practice. This paper provides a framework for assessment of planning methods and an analysis of the comparative merits of seven Nordic mapping methods and how they address the challenges of identification and evaluation of recreational and social values. The assessment shows that challenges are addressed in complementary ways and are tailored to different planning purposes. There is also scope for further improvements of the link between research and planning. This paper provides a framework to compare and evaluate different tools for outdoor recreation planning in urban environments. Planners and managers may use this comparison to select a suitable approach for defining and mapping recreational and social values of urban and peri-urban green spaces. The paper distinguishes between three main methodological approaches: methods based on concepts rooted in perception of design, methods based on mapping experiences and methods focussing on social values. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Temporal form is the computational structure that enables and demands a temporal expression in the resulting design. Temporal form is what enables poetry. In music, temporal form is the composition of tones, pauses, and timbre arranged into harmonies and rhythms. In interaction design it is, for instance, the behaviors of pixels on a screen or the movements in shape-changing interfaces. In this paper we show the power of working explicitly with temporal form in designing computational things. We give a nuanced account of what temporal form is in interaction design, and we look at related work synthesizing what we already know of the temporal concerns in interaction design and HCI. In the second part we present a design experiment through which we explore the experiential qualities of a set of 11 simple temporal forms by letting a series of expert designers reflect upon them. We borrow a framework from Boorstin’s film theory in which he distinguishes between the voyeuristic, the vicarious, and the visceral experience. We show how to use rhythms, complexity, gentle or forceful behavior, etc., to create experiences of “being alive,” being entertained, or being something that we empathize with. We end the paper by arguing how the temporal form in computational things enables richer experiences than static objects do. © 2015 Vallgårda, Winther, Mørch, & Vizer.","Computational Things; Design Research; Form-giving; Shape-change; Temporal Form",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952889927

The study investigates how expected RI performance influences firms' understanding of their RI capability. RI performance is often based on output measures such as market shares or fiscal return. On the contrary, RI capability building advocates for exploration, learning, and accepting uncertainty. Hence, RI capability building often focuses on the processes of the firms, and not the outcome. Thus, it is argued that the RI capability-building and RI performance expectations are based on different managerial orientations. Coupling a discussion of the literature with case findings from four large international firms, this paper identifies a discrepancy between RI capability-building and RI performance within literature and practice. This is regarded to be a major contributing factor to RI program failure.

The study brings together research from two research areas, and the perspective is both of conceptual and summative character. The paper presents key research contributions that illuminate research, and provides an overview of research traditions in the field. A total of 51 studies are included in the literature study, and are organised by setting: 1) natural settings (forests), 2) semi-natural settings (parks) and 3) infrastructure related settings (trails and paths). Most of the studies have a quantitative design. Almost all studies are cross-sectional studies, and present snapshots of the significance of natural environments to active outdoor recreation. The majority of the studies have a health perspective with measures of physical activity in general. Conclusions are that some knowledge exits on the impact and significance of natural environments and places to people's active outdoor recreation, which can be useful to managers and administrators of natural environments as well as to the health sector. Natural environments generally seem to have great impact on people's physical activity. People seek and get various experiences from being active in natural environments and have rather different preferences to the natural settings. This may lead to the conclusion that it is relevant to apply an activity- and context-specific perspective at interventions in natural environments.

We define corporate foresight as a practice that permits an organization to lay the foundation for a future competitive advantage. Historically we distinguish and discuss four main phases: 1) birth of the field (1950s), 2) the age of scenarios (1960s-1970s), 3) professionalization (1980s-1990s), and 4) organizational integration (2000-). A systematic literature search revealed 102 articles on foresight, 29 of them on corporate foresight. Based on these articles and those in this Special Issue, we identify four main themes. Two more mature themes, namely 'organizing corporate foresight', and 'individual and collective cognition', and two emerging themes 'corporate foresight in networked organizations', and 'quantifying value contributions'. In the conclusion we make a plea for establishing corporate foresight as a separate research stream that can adopt various theoretical foundations from a number of general management research traditions. To help the field move forward we identify three areas in which corporate foresight research can build on theoretical notions in general management, and can contribute to such on-going debates. © 2015.","Corporate foresight; Historical development; Review; Strategic foresight","Innovation; Reviews; Technological forecasting; Collective cognition; Competitive advantage; Corporate foresight; General management; Historical development; Networked organizations; Strategic foresight; Theoretical foundations; Competition; corporate strategy; economic history; historical perspective; industrial development; literature review",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949093916

We seek to deepen this understanding by applying a cognitive lens. We mainly explore how and why foresight can influence ways of processing information, first conceptually and then empirically through the case of the Cisco Technology Radar. Through consulting multiple individuals, opposed to focusing solely on statements from top managers or observable outputs on the firm level, we uncover a broad set of ""hidden values"" from this technology foresight initiative. We conclude that a critical mechanism of a system such as the radar is its probing of analytical thinking, as well as its way of making people connect and exchange views across functions and departments.

We also investigated predictors of an entrepreneurial self-identity. Design/methodology/approach: Considering a process model of entrepreneurship, we analyzed two cross-sectional T1 samples of German scientists with regard to two central tasks along the entrepreneurial process (business idea development and business founding) via path model analyses as well as data from follow-up surveys collected at T2 and T3 via regression analyses. Findings: Self-identity predicted founding intentions, above and beyond the effect of the TPB variables. Moreover, self-identity showed a characteristic moderating effect with TPB-intention predictors. Their effect was weaker or even zero at low levels of self-identity. In addition, self-identity forecasted behavior, but had no unique main or moderating effect on behavior in the TPB framework. Self-identity was predictable by past behavior, personality structure, recalled adolescent competencies, and early parental role models. Moreover, an engagement in entrepreneurial activity led to an increase in self-identity over time. Implications: The results suggest that self-identity operates as a motivational factor in entrepreneurial transitions that interacts with TPB variables in a characteristic way. An entrepreneurial self-identity develops from an early developmental stage on, but also during the working life. Originality/value: This study is unique because it integrates the occupational self-concept/self-identity construct into the TPB–entrepreneurship approach, and also delivers new implications concerning how to foster entrepreneurial motivations more effectively by taking the developing occupational self-concept into account. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Academic entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurial motivation; Entrepreneurship; Identity; Intentions; Personality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948573061

A joint action plan was later signed, but the relationship has not yet evolved into a strategic level between two equal partners. Seen from both sides, there are inadequacies and inconsistencies in the way the partnership is being conducted. There are serious complaints especially from India’s perspective about the dialogue itself and a lack of deep and serious commitment to move beyond the obvious and in some cases what is described a patronizing tone from EU delegations. This paper gives an overview of recent developments in the relationship with an emphasis on the period since the beginning of the European sovereign debt crisis and the simultaneous global shift away from geo-economics towards geo-politics. It utilizes a critical international political perspective which gives a coherent understanding of the interaction between what looks like a “normal” trade and investment relationship but what in reality appears as mercantilism mixed up with history, culture and politics. Adding to these difficulties are a number of domestic constraints which complicate the relationship. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948385966

We investigate how contractual flexibility, market uncertainty and technical uncertainty shape upfront fees from the licensee’s perspective. Upfront fees are shown to be positively associated with contractual flexibility and market uncertainty, while technical uncertainty is positively associated with upfront fees only if the license warrants contractual flexibility to the licensee.

In order to understand the known risks and issues associated with the use of nanosilver, we carried out a DPSIR analysis and analysed drivers, pressures, state, impacts and potential policy responses. We found that most concerns relate to the potential development of multi-resistant bacteria and the environmental impacts of nanosilver. From the DPSIR analysis, we found that new (separate) legislation for nanomaterials in general and nanosilver-specific changes in the current European chemical, biocide and medical legislation were the optimal policy responses, along with limiting the overall use of nanosilver. In order to qualify the identified potential policy responses, we carried out a stakeholder analysis, in order to explore possibilities for reaching consensus amongst stakeholders. Through the stakeholder analysis, the interests, views, power and influence of the identified stakeholders were mapped. Overall, the policy options identified in the DPSIR analysis were deemed not to be implementable, as industry and NGOs seem to have fundamentally conflicting views and interests. The use of the combination of DPSIR and stakeholder analysis proved valuable for use in cases of complexity, as they compensate for each other’s limitations and open up for a discussion what can be done to reduce risks. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","DPSIR; Ethics; Nanosilver; Regulation; Stakeholder analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947493882

With its roots in sociology, the concept of embeddedness has gained prominence in the literature on organizations, providing in-depth insight into how relational structures regulate resource integration processes and outcomes. However, the concept of an actor’s embeddedness is rarely discussed in association with service-dominant (S-D) logic. This limits the extant understanding of factors that influence resource exchange and value cocreation among individual actors in service ecosystems. Against this background, this article links S-D logic with social capital theory to establish and conceptualize embeddedness as a key concept. More specifically, this research identifies and delineates structural, relational, and cultural properties of embeddedness and offers a systematic and complementary theoretical understanding to better explain relational constellations based on actors’ resource integration potential. In so doing, this research significantly advances marketing science and particularly the S-D logic school of thought by explicitly clarifying the role of embeddedness and its implications for resource integration.

A cross-sectional survey of 34 medical device designers, primarily in the UK and USA, was conducted in order to fulfil this objective. Findings indicate that there is significant motivation to enhance DfE practice, but that there are multiple barriers to this. Major barriers identified are a perception of the high cost of DfE, the industry's current reliance on a single-use business model for many current products and a lack of education about DfE topics on all sides. Designers felt that the most significant opportunities to implement DfE are in situations where they are able to exert direct control, mainly in the early stages of the design process. Issues noted include raw material choice and packaging decisions. The nature of single use business models is also critical, pointing towards the needs for a systemic rather than product focus. For this to be achieved, financial rewards must be evident to firms and the changing regulatory landscape might also make a more significant impact. © 2015 The Authors","Design for environment (DfE); Design for sustainability (DfS); Ecodesign; Medical devices","Ecodesign; Sustainable development; Business modeling; Cross-sectional surveys; Design for the environment; Environmental considerations; Exploratory studies; Financial rewards; Medical device industry; Medical Devices; Biomedical equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945564536

Often, an output distance function is used, where the classical approach is to exploit its homogeneity property by selecting one output quantity as the dependent variable, dividing all other output quantities by the selected output quantity, and using these ratios as regressors (OD). Another approach is the stochastic ray production frontier (SR), which transforms the output quantities into their Euclidean distance as the dependent variable and their polar coordinates as directional components as regressors. A number of studies have compared these specifications using real world data and have found significant differences in the inefficiency estimates. However, in order to get to the bottom of these differences, we apply a Monte-Carlo simulation. We test the robustness of both specifications for the case of a Translog output distance function with respect to different common statistical problems as well as problems arising as a consequence of zero values in the output quantities. Although our results show clear reactions to some statistical misspecifications, on average none of the approaches is clearly superior.

Taking average efficiencies from both approaches gives clearly better efficiency estimates than taking just the OD or the SR. In the case of zero values in the output quantities, the SR clearly outperforms the OD with observations with zero output quantities omitted and the OD with zero values replaced by a small positive number. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Monte Carlo simulation; Multiple outputs; Output distance function; SFA; Stochastic ray production frontier",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945459718

Fake followers are dangerous for the social platform and beyond, since they may alter concepts like popularity and influence in the Twittersphere - hence impacting on economy, politics, and society. In this paper, we contribute along different dimensions. First, we review some of the most relevant existing features and rules (proposed by Academia and Media) for anomalous Twitter accounts detection. Second, we create a baseline dataset of verified human and fake follower accounts. Such baseline dataset is publicly available to the scientific community. Then, we exploit the baseline dataset to train a set of machine-learning classifiers built over the reviewed rules and features. Our results show that most of the rules proposed by Media provide unsatisfactory performance in revealing fake followers, while features proposed in the past by Academia for spam detection provide good results. Building on the most promising features, we revise the classifiers both in terms of reduction of overfitting and cost for gathering the data needed to compute the features. The final result is a novel Class A classifier, general enough to thwart overfitting, lightweight thanks to the usage of the less costly features, and still able to correctly classify more than 95% of the accounts of the original training set. We ultimately perform an information fusion-based sensitivity analysis, to assess the global sensitivity of each of the features employed by the classifier. The findings reported in this paper, other than being supported by a thorough experimental methodology and interesting on their own, also pave the way for further investigation on the novel issue of fake Twitter followers. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Anomalous account detection; Baseline dataset; Fake followers; Machine learning; Twitter","Artificial intelligence; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Sensitivity analysis; Social networking (online); Baseline dataset; Efficient detection; Experimental methodology; Fake followers; Global sensitivity; Scientific community; Spam detection; Twitter; Classification (of information)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945161749

A survey was conducted among practitioners of the Danish building industry, aiming at investigating whether or not practitioners perceive value differently. The survey revealed that the practitioners had a diverse understanding of how to perceive value in a building project. This is problematic for the efficiency and effectiveness of building projects.

In doing so, it also re-introduces Lynd’s seminal Middletown studies to a wider audience within academic consumer research. Design/methodology/approach – Using the historical-biographical method, light is shed on the developments that led to the publication of the Middletown studies and on the way these studies were received by various audiences. Findings – The critical impetus of interwar social researcher Lynd was to some extent an outcome of his own entanglement with professional marketing and advertising, and of his Protestant religiosity. This insight has important bearings for critical consumer research as well as consumer culture theory today. Research limitations/implications – Market and consumer research comes in many forms. Throughout its history, market and consumer research benefitted from and overlapped with the rise of social research. To fully understand the social and political implications of their work, market and consumer researchers need to have firm knowledge of this interaction with the social sciences and with religious movements in a secular society. Originality/value – Very little is known about the interaction between Robert Lynd’s social research and the sphere of market and consumer research. This interaction is studied by drawing on the secondary literature and on archival sources. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer research; Consumer rights; Middletown studies; Protestantism; Robert Staughton Lynd; Social surveys",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947434161

Design/methodology/approach – Drawing on international business (IB) theory, the authors model MNEs adjusting their home-regional and global market presence over time. The authors test the resulting hypotheses using sales data from a sample of 220 of the world’s largest MNEs over the period 1995-2005. The authors focus specifically on the relationship between levels of market penetration inside and outside the home region and rates of change in each domain. Findings – The authors demonstrate that MNEs do penetrate both home-regional and global markets, often simultaneously, and that penetration levels often oscillate within an MNE over time. The authors show firms’ rates of regional and global expansion to be affected by their existing regional and global penetration, as well as their interplay. Finally, the authors identify differences in the steady states at which firms stabilize their penetration levels in the home-regional and the global space. The findings broadly confirm the MNE as an interdependent portfolio with important regional demarcations.

The purpose of this paper is to challenge these promises by analysing the implications of introducing telecare in the rehabilitation of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Design/methodology/approach – Empirically, the paper is based on interviews with and observations of rehabilitation therapists and patients taking part in a Danish telerehabilitation programme. Theoretically, the paper draws on Science and Technology Studies. Findings – The introduction of telecare alters rehabilitation practices in multiple ways. First, several new time-consuming work routines, carried out in collaboration between therapists, patients and technical professions, emerge. Although crucial in establishing and maintaining telerehabilitation infrastructures, this work remains invisible in evaluations of the programme. Second, rather than simply increasing patient agency, responsibilities are redistributed and negotiated in subtle and non-uniform ways. These negotiations make it less transparent where one responsibility begins and where another potentially conflicting one ends. Practical implications – Evaluations of telecare technologies should pay more attention to work- and responsibility-related effects of introducing telecare in order better to account for predicted and unpredicted as well as desirable and undesirable socio-technical changes. Originality/value – Using an ethnographic approach, the paper points to the discrepancy between simplistic political promises that telecare technologies can serve as tools for improvement, on the one hand, and the substantial changes in the organisation and management of healthcare observed in practice, on the other. Rather than regarding telecare as technologies of improvement, it is more productive to regard them as technologies of change. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Healthcare; Organisation-of-care; Qualitative research; Technology; User studies; Work","cooperation; Denmark; human; interview; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; qualitative research; self care; telemedicine; Cooperative Behavior; Denmark; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Qualitative Research; Self Care; Telemedicine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947078574

Findings – Comparing leadership as configurations of practices across four different clinical settings, the author shows how flexible and often shared leadership practices were embedded in and central to the core clinical work in all units studied here, especially in more unpredictable work settings. Practices of symbolic work and emotional support to staff were particularly important when patients were severely ill.

Future research is invited to extend the findings presented here by exploring leadership practices from a micro-level perspective in additional health care contexts: particularly the embedded and emergent nature of such practices. Practical implications – This paper shows leadership practices to be primarily embedded in the clinical work and often shared across organizational or professional boundaries.

The core question is: what is the role that special interests play in a situation with significantly improved evidence through a growing number of high-quality international benchmark studies on entrepreneurial performance. Design/methodology/approach – An ethnographic method is applied to analyse in depth the 2005 decision by the Danish Government to shift from a volume-oriented to a growth-oriented entrepreneurship policy. This decision process is an extreme case since Denmark has world-class evidence of its entrepreneurial performance. Findings – Even in such a well-investigated country, which since 2000 has had a pioneering role in the development of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor study and international register-based studies, the special interests of a few top-level politicians and civil servants have significantly influenced the decision to shift the overall policy. These special interests guided the interpretation of the ambiguous evidence provided by these two benchmark studies. Practical implications – Policy makers are made aware of the need to take a critical view on international benchmark studies, asking what is studied and how and realising that “the truth” about a country’s entrepreneurial performance cannot be found in just one study. Originality/value – The theoretical value of this paper is its challenge to the widespread rationality view in the entrepreneurship policy field and a deepened understanding of how the pursuit of special interests is related to ambiguous evidence and system-level rationality. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Benchmark studies; Decision making; Entrepreneurial performance; Entrepreneurship policy; Rationality; Special interests",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946840241

China as the second largest economy is suffering from the dilemma of rapid industrialization and urbanization, and sustainable development. One of the most severe problems affecting China's sustainable urban development is the resource dependent city, in which resource mining and process industries dominate the local economy. With the depletion of natural resources and the degradation of environment, the concept of sustainability and economy transition solutions become more and more important. Under this condition, this study aims to conduct a comprehensive review on the major projects for a more sustainable future in China's national resource dependent cities and propose a countermeasure for the sustainability transition based on the industrial symbiosis concept. Firstly, an investigation on the panoramic view, challenges, transiting policies of China's resource dependent cities' project has been carried out. Subsequently, Guiyang city in Guizhou province of China, as a typical resource dependent city, has been chosen as example of industrial and regional symbiosis focusing on the integration and symbiosis of coal, electricity, aluminum, phosphor chemical, iron/steel industry and urban. Then, a quantitative assessment on the environmental benefits has been conducted based on material flow analysis approach. Results highlight a dramatic resource saving, solid waste reduction and carbon dioxide emission mitigation, as well as generating revenue for companies and local business opportunities. Finally, policy implications for promoting the industry symbiosis are discussed in details. Our research provides an efficacious solution for the transition of resource dependent cities, and it is revelatory for future sustainable urban planning and policy making in China. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","China; Industrial symbiosis; Resource dependent cities; Sustainable urban development; System integration","Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Public policy; Sustainable development; Urban growth; China; Industrial symbiosis; Resource dependent cities; Sustainable urban development; System integration; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942989384

In the case of future crop production, the effects of climate change should be considered. In this context, the objectives of this paper are two-fold: (i) to recommend an approach to deal with uncertainty in scenario analysis for LCA of crop production in a changed climate, when the goal of the study is to suggest strategies for adaptation of crop cultivation practices towards low environmental impacts, and (ii) to implement the suggested approach to spring barley cultivation in Denmark. First, the main implications of climate change for future crop cultivation are analyzed, and the factors which should be included when modeling the climate change effects on crops through LCA are introduced, namely climate, soil, water loss and production parameters. Secondly, the handling of these factors in the inventory modeling is discussed and finally implemented in the case study. Our approach follows a 3-step procedure consisting of: (1) definition of a baseline scenario at the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) level for the selected crop and performance of Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) including normalization and contribution analysis, in order to identify the focus points in terms of impact categories, unit processes and substances; (2) identification of the main deviations from the baseline scenario for these key parameters in alternative future scenarios; (3) comparison of the different scenarios including quantification of the uncertainty at inventory level. The procedure presented was successfully implemented to assess the consequences of the changed climate on Danish spring barley cultivated under future climate conditions. The LCA results, obtained using mainly primary data from phytotron experiments mimicking a future Danish climate, emphasized that adaptation strategies should prioritize the development of resilient and stable cultivars, i.e. robust to the expected extremes of the future climate and offering a reasonable yield under different climatic conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Hotspot analysis; LCI; Normalization; Primary data; Scenario analysis; Uncertainty analysis","Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Springs (components); Uncertainty analysis; Hot spot; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life cycle inventories; Normalization; Primary data; Scenario analysis; Scenarios of the future; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942986772

Multiplicity, as a post-ANT sensibility, helps one make sense of the empirical materials. This paper examines the possibility that rather than being alternatives to one another, plural futures and the singular future might co-exist in practice, and, thus, constitute a multiplicity. Design/methodology/approach – In this case study, “planning” is narrative scenario planning. The second author facilitates dialogue-based long-term strategic scenario planning processes, primarily in Scandinavia and Northern Europe, and contributes a wealth of professional experience to the project. The first author, an academic, shadows the second author. This paper examines experiential and observational data for evidence of the ontological character of the future. Elements of a typical scenario planning process, in this case, about the possibility of crewless (i.e. unmanned) shipping vessels are demonstrated – although, insight into the crewless ship is submerged by our analytical attentiveness to the ontology of the future. Findings – The findings bear on what sort of “object” the future is. Practices associated with planning for the future appear to transform it so that one future becomes many, and, without irony, managing the growing number of futures seems to be a core function of planning for the future. The implication is that neither plural futures nor the singular future is – individually – satisfactory to capture what is found in practice. It is both plural and singular; ontologically, it is the future multiple. Originality/value – The original contribution is in demonstrating how plural futures and the singular future co-exist in practice. Thus, an eclipse of the future by futures can only ever be partial. For “futures” to be conceptually potent, “the future” must be at least provisionally believable and occasionally useful. Otherwise, if “the future” were so preposterous an idea, then “futures” would cease to be a critical alternative to it. Futures needs the future; they are relationally bound together in a multiplicity. This paper considers what such a logical reality implies for a field that distances itself from the future and self-identifies with futures. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Actor-network theory; Maritime industry; Multiplicity; Ontology; Scenario planning; Science and technology studies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944750810

Design/methodology/approach - Inputs were taken from industry experts in identifying and understanding interdependencies among food retail supply chain risks on different levels (sourcing and logistics outside the retail stores; storage and customer interface at the stores). Interdependencies among risks and their impact on performance measures are structured into a hierarchy in order to derive subsystems of interdependent elements to derive useful insights for theory and practice. Findings - Using the ISM approach the risks and performance measures were clustered according to their driving power and dependence power. Change in/inadequate government regulations' are at the bottom level of the hierarchy implying highest driving power and require higher attention and focussed mitigation strategies. Risks like lack of traceability, transport delays/breakdowns and temperature abuse, cross-contamination in transport and storage have medium driver and dependence powers. Research limitations/implications - The approach is focussed on food retail supply chains in the Indian context and thereby limits the ability to generalize the findings. The academics and experts were selected on convenience and availability. Practical implications - It gives managers a better understanding of the risks and performance measures that have most influence on others (driving performance measures) and those measures which are most influenced by others (dependent performance measures) in fresh food retail and also a tool to prioritize them. This kind of information is strategic for managers who can use it to identify which performance measures they should concentrate on managing the trade-offs between measures. The findings and the applicability for practical use have been validated by both experts and practicing managers in food retail supply chains. Originality/value - The work is perhaps the first to link supply chain risks with performance and explains the propagation of risks in food retail supply chains. It contributes to theory by addressing a few research gaps and provides relevant managerial insights for practitioners. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Food retail supply chain; India, MICMAC analysis; Interpretive structural modelling; Prioritization of risks; Propagation of risks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944326362

Most research has focused on the individual in relation to expatriate adjustment. The general conditions of the host country, however, could represent an important contextual factor that needs to be explored further. Design/methodology/approach – Based on an empirical study of 130 expatriate managers on foreign assignments in France (61) and Germany (69), the authors take a comparative perspective and examine differences for sociocultural and psychological adjustment as well as time to proficiency in both countries. Findings – The authors found that expatriates assigned to France show higher degrees of work adjustment and general adjustment than those in Germany. This was unexpected as Germany is generally described as a more transparent, open and welcoming country. Results may thus challenge stereotypical conceptions of national differences and indicate that globalization processes are gradually changing country-specific conditions.

Numerous studies have explored this strategy but there are significant gaps in the existing literature, particularly in environmental practices specific to India. In this connection, there is a need to explore green manufacturing practices (GMP) in an Indian context. The purpose of this article is to select the best GMP based on dimensions and relevant criteria with the assistance of a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making model combining DEMATEL based on ANP (DANP) with Preference Ranking Organisation METHod for Enrichment Evaluations. A methodological framework is proposed to evaluate GMP and the same is validated within a particular single case industry situated in the southern part of India, who is the leading manufacturer of rubber tyres and tubes. By virtue of these findings, industries can identify the best GM practice to adopt in order to increase the chances of profit and performance throughout their systems. This study concludes by successfully identifying the best GM practice for this case industry, and it provides some important managerial implications. This research explores some future trends to make the study more reliable in changing real life scenarios. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","green manufacturing practices; hybrid MCDM","Decision making; Rubber industry; Tire industry; Environmental practices; Environmentally conscious manufacturing; hybrid MCDM; Managerial implications; Manufacturing practices; Methodological frameworks; Multi-criteria decision-making models; Preference ranking organisation method for enrichment evaluations; Green manufacturing; Green manufacturing; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941943592

Danish construction is no exception and a number of political initiatives have been established to address the unsatisfying amounts of defects. One of the political initiatives, benchmarking, collects and provides information from building projects on defects at handover to clients and on a number of project characteristics. This article utilizes the substantial amount of data from the benchmarking initiative to examine which project characteristics differentiate building projects with none or few cosmetic defects from those with many and/or serious defects. The article reviews the results from studying two quantitative data sets: (I) benchmarking data from 329 building projects and 621 contracts and (II) questionnaire data from an electronic survey comprising 130 contractors. This study provides in-depth knowledge about correlations between project characteristics and the extent of defects measured at handover. Results show statistically significant differences between building projects characterized by no or few defects compared with building projects with many and/or serious defects. Determining characteristics are the planning of budgetary conditions, time schedules and early, continuous quality control. Furthermore, this study also indicates collaboration between stakeholders plus skills and safety initiatives as having a positive influence on the performance measured as defects at handover. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","building defects; handover process; management; project characteristics; quality","Benchmarking; Budget control; Buildings; Image quality; Management; Meteorological problems; Surveys; Building defects; Handover process; In-depth knowledge; Project characteristics; Quantitative data sets; Questionnaire data; Safety initiatives; Statistically significant difference; Defects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941738199

This perspective is largely absent from existing research on transparency, which construes transparency as unmediated or fails to investigate the organizing properties of specific mediating technologies. We argue that mediating technologies, conceptualized here as disclosure devices, have distinctive organizing properties that are important to scrutinize. They play a central role in attempts to shed light on objects, subjects and practices, and to help build or break up relationships within and across sites and organizations. We focus on three disclosure devices and their respective knowledge creation processes: (a) due diligence, whose emphasis is on qualitative knowledge production; (b) rankings, which is about quantitative knowledge production; (c) big data analysis, which underscores algorithmic knowledge production. We conceptualize the distinct features of these disclosure devices, indicate ways in which they shape organizational processes and discuss some of the ethical and political challenges they pose. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Actor-networks; affordance theory; anti-corruption; big data; disclosure devices; due diligence; governmentality; knowledge production; rankings; transparency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988268374

Findings are based on an examination of the Centre for the Development of Human Resources and Quality Management (SCKK), a social partnership-based organization that funds workplace development projects at state workplaces, and of nine participative development projects that received financial and logistical support from the SCKK. These projects increased union and management commitment to partnership-based approaches to problem-solving, despite their ambiguous results for both groups. This suggests that intermediary cooperative associations help to enhance the normative legitimacy of participative work practices through the provision of resources and ‘best practice’ management approaches. © 2014, The Author(s) 2014.","Cooperative models; Denmark; Industrial relations; Intermediary associations; Labour–management cooperation; Participation; Work design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84988227698

A previously unexplored aspect of such patterns relates to the temporal dynamics of information transfer between activities as those activities are implemented through the network of people executing the project. To address this gap, we develop a dynamic modeling method that integrates both the network of people and the network of activities in the project. We then employ a large dataset collected from an industrial setting, consisting of project-related e-mails and activity records from the design and development of a renewable energy plant over the course of more than three years. Using network metrics for centrality and clustering, we make three important contributions: 1) We demonstrate a novel method for analyzing information flows between activities in complex engineering design projects; 2) we show how the network of information flows in a large-scale engineering project evolved over time and how network analysis yields several managerial insights; and 3) we provide a useful new representation of the engineering design process and thus support theory-building toward the evolution of information flows through systems engineering stages. Implications include guidance on how to analyze and predict information flows as well as better planning of information flows in engineering design projects according to their individual stage and activity characteristics. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Electronic mail; Information exchange; Organizational aspects; Systems engineering and theory","Complex networks; Design; Electronic mail; Systems engineering; Dynamic network analysis; Engineering design process; Engineering design projects; Information exchanges; Large-scale engineering; Organizational aspects; Renewable energy plants; Systems engineering and theories; Curricula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960393888

In contrast, the HRM literature on knowledge sharing examines the influence of single practices on individual-level knowledge sharing, but fails to include the influence of combinations of practices. We link the idea of fit between practices to employee motivation for knowledge sharing by arguing that rewards may be ambiguous and difficult to interpret, but that such ambiguity may be reduced if rewards are combined with other aligned HRM practices, notably job design and work climate. Thus, fit is established through the ambiguity-reducing effect of combining specific HRM practices. Accordingly, we test for complementarities among rewards, job design, and work climate in the form of a three-way interaction among these variables with respect to their impact on knowledge-sharing motivation. Our analysis of 1,523 employees in five knowledge-intensive firms shows that employees who are exposed to knowledge-sharing rewards experience higher levels of autonomous motivation to share when they are simultaneously exposed to a noncontrolling job design and work climate that support knowledge sharing. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Job design; Knowledge management; Reward systems","employee; exposure; human; human experiment; motivation; reward; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954213914

This study extends this stream by investigating the influences of cooperation and culture on the link between leader-member skill distance (one special type of team heterogeneity) and team performance. Building upon input-process-output framework from the perspective of individualist and collectivist cultures, we propose that the association between leader-member skill distance and team performance has an inverted-U shape in individualist cultures. Further, in such cultures, team cooperation can augment the positive effect of leader-member skill distance on team performance. In contrast, in collectivist cultures, the association between leader-member skill distance and team performance has a monotonic and positive shape, and team cooperation will attenuate the positive effect of leader-member skill distance on team performance.

Both are practice-led, with uneasy but productive relationships with theorizing. Exploring their relations offers ways to address challenges faced by interdisciplinary management research, which struggles to connect research and practice. The authors describe how they brought the two fields together. We outline how we convened, designed and facilitated the fourth Oxford Futures Forum held in May 2014. This event brought together leading practitioners and researchers in a collective inquiry based on self-organizing, generative and reflexive making and dialogue. How participants engaged, from responding to the invitation to take part, as well as their practical and discursive encounters with one another during the event, threw up similarities and differences between the two fields. We present nine themes that capture the links and spaces between design and scenarios, yet suggest that they are not a straightforward overlap or a simple relationship, but rather a range of interactions between the fields, including feeding in, bridging, tension and repulsion. The paper's contribution is to suggest how scenario planning can engage with design, resulting in new opportunities for research and projects. These modes of engagement provide a framing to explore dialogues between other management disciplines. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Design thinking; Engaged scholarship; Interdisciplinarity; Scenario planning; Strategic design","design; interdisciplinary approach; management; research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949625921

Our points of departure are the need in scenario practice to embrace uncertainty, discomfort and knowledge gaps, and the connected need to capture and make productive fundamental plurality among understandings of the future. To help respond to these needs, we introduce what Nelson Goodman calls worldmaking. It holds that there is no singular, objective world (or ""real reality""), and instead that worlds are multiple, constructed through creative processes instead of given, and always in the process of becoming. We then explore how worldmaking can operationalise discordant pluralism in scenario practice by allowing participants to approach not only the future but also the present in a constructivist and pluralistic fashion; and by extending pluralism to ontological domains. Building on this, we investigate how scenario worldmaking could lead to more imaginative scenarios: worldmaking is framed as a fully creative process which gives participants ontological agency, and it helps make contrasts, tensions and complementarities between worlds productive. We go on to propose questions that can be used to operationalize scenario worldmaking, and conclude with the expected potential and limitations the approach, as well as suggestions for practical experimentation. © 2015 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Agency; Deconstruction; Imagination; Pluralism; Scenarios; Worlds","future prospect; globalization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949623128

We argue that meaning by story making is not always created by coherence and causality; meaning is created by different types of fragmentation: discontinuities, tensions and editing. The objective of this article is to develop and advance antenarrative practice analysis of work stories by exploring how different types of fragmentation create meanings. This is done by studying the work stories of job and personnel consultants and by drawing on the results of a narrative, ethnographic study of a consultancy. The analysis demonstrates how work stories are social practices negotiated, retold, edited and performed by the storyteller in an ongoing process allowing tensions, discontinuities and editing between failures and achievements, between dreams and work realities and between home and work life. We argue that by including different types of fragmentation, we offer a new type of antenarrative practice approach that offers a contemporary method for exploring meaning creation in work stories. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.","Antenarratives; consultancy; narrative; practice; storytelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948400104

In this article, we propose a conceptual framework for assessing the effects that different public subsidies have on the utilisation of private non-profit sport facilities. Based on theories drawn from the public administration literature three different subsidy schemes are introduced: New Public Management, Governance and Budget. How they will influence the utilisation of a sport facility is assessed using insights from institutional and motivational theory from political science along with the role the voluntary sport organisations play in sport facilities. The resulting conceptual framework consists of twelve different strategies. It is argued that it is likely that a sport facility will choose one or more of these, and which strategies it chooses will impact the level of utilisation. The aim of the article is to show plausible conjectures for future empirical research into how to increase sport facility utilisation via different policies and thus inform future research into the complex interplay between the public sector, sport facilities and voluntary sport organisations. © 2015 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand.","Governance; Institutionalism; Public policy; Sport facilities; Sport management; Voluntary sport organisations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947494024

This expectation is tested for transformational and transactional leadership, as both types of practices are expected to increase performance. Using a sample of 1,621 teachers and 79 Danish high school principals, the authors find that leader-intended and employee-perceived transformational and transactional leadership are only weakly correlated and that only employee-perceived leadership practices (both transformational and transactional) are significantly related to objectively measured school performance.

One of the key elements of the Smart Grid is that electricity consumers make some of their consumption available as flexible capacity to balance the grid. Consumers' flexible capacity is only available to the grid if the consumers adopt Smart Grid technology (SGT) that establishes the link between the electric system and the consumer. This technology is new to private consumers and using it involves behavioural changes. There is a need to get more insight into who are willing to adopt SGT and why. This study draws on innovation adoption theory as a framework for understanding consumer adoption of this new technology. We explore whether consumers who have already adopted other types of new energy technology, such as a geothermal heat pump, are more favourably disposed towards SGT than other consumers. Also, we explore how consumers who have signed up to let their heat pump be used as flexible capacity in a test trial differ from other heat pump owners, if at all. We used semi-structured interviews with household members as well as a questionnaire to explore differences between three groups: households with (1) a heat pump with SGT (n=11), (2) a heat pump-only (n=7), or (3) an oil-fired boiler (n=6). We find that the families in the three groups perceive the technology characteristics differently and those who have trial experience with SGT are most in favour of the technology. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Adoption; Household study; Smart Grid technology; Sustainable innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945459898

This is done by investigating how employees and managers in 13 Danish work organizations draw on stereotypical perceptions of femininity when they talk about their colleague with cerebral palsy, and by examining how these stereotypical perceptions influence the work lives of the participating employees with cerebral palsy - as seen from their own perspective. The empirical point of departure is an interview study conducted in 2013 with 13 employees with cerebral palsy, 44 colleagues and 19 managers. In contrast to the findings of much research on gender and work, this study finds that stereotypically feminized perceptions of employees with cerebral palsy as weak, in need of help, etc., are linked to the impairments of the employee rather than his or her biological sex or the specific gender norms of the particular industry. The analysis of this article thus contributes to increase our understanding of gender processes in work organizations. More specifically, the article shows how impairments intersect with gender perceptions; in this case how the study participants with cerebral palsy are expected to relate to and reproduce stereotypically female behaviour - regardless of their biological sex. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Disability; Employee-employer relations; Impairment; Masculinity; Stereotypical gender perceptions; Work organization","disability; gender issue; masculinization; perception; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945182598

Specifically, we propose that local R&D collaborations need to be large in scale and broad in scope. The empirics are based on the analysis of a sample of 160 high-tech Chinese firms observed from 2000 to 2011. Consistent with our predictions, our findings contribute to extending the relational view by addressing the relations among the relationships of focal firms. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Chinese firms; Firms' performance; Foreign technology; Internal resources; Relational views; Resource-based view; Technological innovation; Technological resources; Innovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943198266

We present experimental evidence on its validity in the domain of objective probabilities. Our battery of lottery pairs includes simple one-stage lotteries, two-stages compound lotteries, and their actuarially equivalent one-stage lotteries. We find violations of ROCL and that behavior is better characterized by a source-dependent version of the Rank-Dependent Utility model rather than Expected Utility Theory. Since we use the popular ""1-in-K"" random lottery incentive mechanism payment procedure in our main test, our experiment explicitly recognizes the impact that this payment procedure may have on preferences. Thus we also collect data using the ""1-in-1"" payment procedure. We do not infer any violations of ROCL when subjects are only given one decision to make. These results are supported by both structural estimation of latent preferences as well as non-parametric analysis of choice patterns. The random lottery incentive mechanism, used as payment protocol, itself induces an additional layer of ""compounding"" by design that might create confounds in tests of ROCL. Therefore, we provide a word of caution for experimenters interested in studying ROCL for other purposes, such as the relationship between ambiguity attitudes and attitudes toward compound lotteries, to carefully think about the design to study ROCL, payment protocols and their interaction with the preferences being elicited. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Decision under uncertainty; Experiment; Reduction of compound lotteries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939781050

The extent to which a business model hampers or promotes certain types of eco-innovations remains an open question. In order to shed light on this issue, the authors develop a conceptual framework to show how a specific type of business model (Product-Service Systems) could be applied to the context of the maritime industry. With a focus on the Danish maritime industry, the case study addresses two questions: Which business models are being used to develop, install and service the ballast water treatment technology? And, How can these business models add value to the ballast water treatment systems in the market? The case shows that different business models are applied depending on whether the installation is on new or retrofitted vessels. Both installation and operation stages of ballast water treatment systems provide opportunities for collaboration among stakeholders. Based on the Eco-costs/Value Ratio model, the authors perform an analysis of on-board and port-based ballast water treatment systems with the aim to propose a possible product-service system. These results suggest that port-based systems have the highest potential for eco-efficient value creation and a possible product-service system can be designed for this kind of technology. The article highlights the point that authorities need to improve regulations to stimulate port-based ballast water treatment systems rather than on-board ballast management systems. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, a number of studies find that geography has been reluctant to integrate sustainability issues in its curricula. Geography is particularly interesting and can contribute to education for sustainability debates in various disciplines due to its strong tradition within the human-environment theme. This article presents an empirical analysis of contested ideas of sustainability approaches in Danish University geography degree programs, and the significance given to them by geographers. Hereby the paper critically examines political ecologies when introducing sustainability themes into the curricula. In so doing, it is discussed how different sustainability typologies in education bear relation to different ways of dealing with spatio-temporal tides and waves of the human-environment interface. It is concluded that though geographers find sustainability themes important to geography, sustainability is more often implicit than it is explicit. This produces a number of dilemmas and contradictions since geographers both seek to distance themselves from produced politics while at the same time elucidating them. This finding reveals contradictions within and between traditional ESD approaches, counterproductive to the aims of different typologies themselves. Since frictions between different ESD approaches are fundamentally interdisciplinary, the relevance of this finding is significant across disciplines. Thus, scholars and students should learn to go beyond the geopolitics of education in order to transcend the paradoxical-culture-natures identified. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Universities are globally required to have quality assurance to secure and improve teaching and learning, and they use management systems to this aim. Integrating education for sustainable development and management systems are alike in that they are based on continuous improvement and systematic thinking; for both processes all stakeholders need to be involved. Although quality assurance is compulsory for higher education, education for sustainable development has barely been examined or integrated in this context. This article examines how voluntary integration of education for sustainable development into management systems at universities could facilitate a scheme to overcome the challenges to integrating education for sustainable development that were identified in previous research. For this, a process framework for integrating education for sustainable development with management systems was developed in a network of 11 universities in the Nordic countries. The framework included planning, assessment, monitoring, and implementation of education for sustainable development. It was piloted and applied to identify relevant sustainability aspects in different disciplines, examples of which are provided in the article. The framework can be applied to visualize the implementation of education for sustainable development. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines the acculturation of self-initiated expatriates in local and foreign-owned organizations. Based on the choice-within-constraints framework in new institutional theory, we propose that self-initiated expatriate academics in local organizations are better adjusted to general life and interaction with host country nationals than their counterparts in foreign-owned organizations. We also suggest that, due to limited available human cognitive capacity, the adjustment of expatriate academics with regard to general life and interaction in the two types of organizations has different consequences for work-related outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesize that for expatriates in foreign organizations, general adjustment is positively associated with work-related outcomes while, for expatriates in local organizations, interaction adjustment is instead positively associated with their work-related outcomes. Based on 210 self-initiated expatriate academics in China and Taiwan, our findings generally provide support for these hypothesized relationships. By demonstrating the role of organization type in expatriate adjustment we contribute to the use of social learning theory in this area) arguing that acculturation should not be perceived to occur in a vacuum.

We examine this general public sector problem by collecting unique data on budget institutions and conflicts of interest within the Swedish municipalities. Our estimations suggest that institutions pertaining to both the planning stage and the implementation stage of the budget process are important for fiscal performance. The fiscal surplus is higher in municipalities that have centralized their budget process to some degree, and where local committees are allowed to carry over surpluses or forced to carry over deficits between fiscal years. The associations however differ between municipalities with different degrees of conflicts of interests, calling for further research to understand the incentives given by the result carry-over rules. We further find that the fiscal surplus is higher in municipalities where local managers face a relatively high risk of dismissal as a consequence of budget deficits. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Budget institutions; Conflicts of interest; Fiscal performance; Local governments",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942504368

Particularly, issues of motivation, collaboration, management, and institutional contexts have been subject to extensive scrutiny. Less prominent on this research agenda, the issue of public perceptions and legitimacy is highly relevant to the conversation on welfare state and civil society. This study contributes on this topic by investigating the public legitimacy of volunteer involvement in public welfare services. The article presents findings from a qualitative interview study of perceptions of welfare institutions conducted in 2013–2014 among 115 participants from Sweden and Denmark. The hypothesis investigated is that the Nordic model of welfare is legitimized by its public nature to a degree which excludes volunteers from legitimately contributing as part of public welfare institutions. Findings suggest that volunteers are held in high regard among Swedes and Danes, but the involvement of volunteers in public welfare provision is deemed both a threat to the Nordic model of Welfare and matter-out-of-place in regards to the role the interview participants ascribed to volunteers and civil society. © 2015, International Society for Third-Sector Research and The Johns Hopkins University.","Attitudes; Hybrid; Interviews; Legitimacy; Volunteers; Welfare services","civil society; local participation; perception; public service; welfare provision; Denmark; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942067565

Based on an analytical framework inspired by the policy fields approach (Stone and Sandfort 2009), the paper argues that to understand the non-profit sector, it is necessary to take a closer look at the differences and similarities not only across welfare fields, but also across non-profit providers and their public counterparts within the same field. Based on data from case studies on primary schools and nursing homes in two Danish municipalities, a number of explanatory factors are identified and analyzed: Regulative rules, funding issues, norms and expectations, and the degree of competition. Results show important differences in the institutional environment of the two welfare fields, and that these differences have an actual impact on outcomes: Both collaborative activities of welfare providers and organizational commitment among leaders, employees, and users are highly influenced by characteristics of the institutional environment.

The new 1107/2009 directive which came into effect in 2011 has triggered an on-going debate on defining specific protection goals for ERA. During this period, we conducted a study on policy change among the most influential ERA stakeholders from Europe. We interviewed 43, purposively sampled, participants from the European safety authorities, plant protection product industry and academia. Transcribed interviews underwent thematic analysis conducted separately by two coders. As we followed the advocacy coalition framework, our findings focus on stakeholders processes, interrelations and values behind the ERA policy change. The main challenges emerging from our analysis turned out to be the slow uptake of scientific developments into ERA and very broadly defined protection goals. The use of safety factors and cut-off criteria left risk assessors with many uncertainties. With ERA in its current form it turned out to be impossible to determine whether the current scheme is over- or under-protective. Still, the study shows that the problem of over- or under-protectiveness lies deep in the perception of stakeholders and depends greatly on their priorities. Academics strive for better ecological relevance as a priority. They have concerns that ERA is oversimplified. Regulators worry that ERA relies too much on risk mitigation and is possibly not protective enough, but at the same time, the majority believes that the assessment is well established and straightforward to follow. Industry representatives would like to see ERA based more on probabilistic risk assessment. Recent changes, according to risk assessment and management practitioners have led to an inevitable increase in complexity, which is not perceived as a positive thing, and does not necessarily translate into better risk assessment. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","advocacy coalition framework; environmental risk assessment; ERA; policy change; risk communication","Accident prevention; Ecology; Environmental regulations; Safety factor; Advocacy coalition framework; Ecological risk assessment; Environmental risk assessment; Plant protection products; Policy changes; Probabilistic Risk Assessment; Risk assessment and managements; Risk communication; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945478261

Notably, the entrepreneurs seek to exhaust the localized resource base before seeking out non-local resources.

The aim of this paper is to extend the discussion on the effects of local and global innovation collaborations on the degree of novelty of innovation by considering this context. Our main question is: Does embeddedness in the developed or emerging country context affect the likelihood of benefiting from local or global linkages for innovations with higher novelty? The paper is based on data gathered through a survey of firms in the ICT sector in an emerging economy (India) context and from two Scandinavian countries (Sweden and Norway). The findings of this study show that global linkages do indeed impact the degree of novelty of innovation. However, country context does have a moderating effect. While the effect of global linkages is highly positive on the innovativeness of Scandinavian firms, for the Indian SMEs, the linkages that give novel innovations are the regional ones. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","degree of novelty; external sources; global linkages; ICT; India; regional linkages; Scandinavia; SME","developing world; globalization; industrial location; information and communication technology; innovation; small and medium-sized enterprise; India; Norway; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953743687

In this paper, we propose an approach to integrate dynamic resource management with passive fault-tolerance mechanisms in a MP-SPE so that we can harvest the checkpoints prepared for failure recovery to enhance the efficiency of dynamic load migrations. To maximize the opportunity of reusing checkpoints for fast load migration, we formally define a checkpoint allocation problem and provide a pragmatic algorithm to solve it. We implement all the proposed techniques on top of Apache Storm, an open-source MPSPE, and conduct extensive experiments using a real dataset to examine various aspects of our techniques. The results show that our techniques can greatly improve the efficiency of dynamic resource reconfiguration without imposing significant overhead or latency to the normal job execution. © 2015 ACM.","Elasticity; Fault-tolerance; Resource management","Dynamic loads; Efficiency; Elasticity; Engines; Fault tolerance; Knowledge management; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Waste management; Allocation problems; Dynamic resource management; Dynamic resources; Fault tolerance mechanisms; Large-scale clusters; Massively parallels; Resource management; Waste of resources; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958257272

Search engines assist the users by presenting query suggestions. To preserve the original search intent, suggestions should be context-aware and account for the previous queries issued by the user. Achieving context awareness is challenging due to data sparsity. We present a novel hierarchical recurrent encoder-decoder architecture that makes possible to account for sequences of previous queries of arbitrary lengths. As a result, our suggestions are sensitive to the order of queries in the context while avoiding data sparsity. Additionally, our model can suggest for rare, or long-tail, queries. The produced suggestions are synthetic and are sampled one word at a time, using computationally cheap decoding techniques. This is in contrast to current synthetic suggestion models relying upon machine learning pipelines and hand-engineered feature sets. Results show that our model outperforms existing context-aware approaches in a next query prediction setting. In addition to query suggestion, our architecture is general enough to be used in a variety of other applications. © 2015 ACM.","Query suggestion; Recurrent neural networks","Artificial intelligence; Decoding; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Network architecture; Search engines; Context- awareness; Context-aware approaches; Data sparsity; Decoding techniques; Encoder-decoder; Encoder-decoder architecture; Query suggestion; Search intents; Recurrent neural networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958256008

This paper makes a series of novel conceptual propositions regarding the associations between state, effect and response uncertainty and the organizational interpretation process. Design/methodology/approach – This conceptual paper extends existing conceptual work by distinguishing between general and issue-specific scanning and linking the interpretation process to three different types of perceived uncertainty: state, effect and response uncertainty. Findings – It is proposed that environmental scanning leads to lower state and effect uncertainty, i.e. less uncertainty regarding the estimation of probabilities of events occurring in the external environment of the organization and of their consequences. It is further proposed that scanning leads to higher levels of perceived control over events and that the actual interpretation of events, in opportunity/threat terms, drives irregular issue-specific scanning and organizational reactions to such events. Research limitations/implications – The paper suggests a way to test links between organizational interpretation and uncertainty that might help explain and untangle some of the conflicting empirical results found in the extant literature. The paper illustrates how the literature could benefit from re-conceptualizing the perceived environmental uncertainty construct to take into account different types of uncertainty. Practical implications – For practitioners, this paper emphasizes the importance of environmental scanning and how scanning practices can lead to general alertness, to more positive event interpretations and how interpretations form responses to opportunities in the environment. Originality/value – This paper extends on existing work by linking the interpretation process to three different types of uncertainty (state, effect and response uncertainty) with several novel and testable propositions.

Data were collected from a sample of 759 knowledge workers selected from 23 knowledge-intensive manufacturing companies exposed to international markets and located in Tuscany (Italy). The analysis is based on multivariate regression models considering KD and KC as dependent variables. Findings – The results show that individual, organizational and technological factors matter to KS. Specifically, the paper reports that individual-level enablers and supportive leadership have a positive effect on both sub-processes of knowledge sharing. Further, the organic management system has a strong and positive impact on KD, while the efficacy of information and communication technology solutions is positively related to KC.

Originality/value – OPO and KPO play an essential role in transferring the effect of employees’ affective commitment to common knowledge sharing and key knowledge sharing, which unravels the blackbox of how effective commitment affects knowledge sharing. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Human resource management; Innovation; Knowledge management; Knowledge sharing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942017852

Design/methodology/approach – Based on data collected from 250 firms in Brazil and Denmark, structural equation modeling is used to investigate the relationship between organizational culture and the use of quality techniques, and its impact on operational performance. Four quality technique groups, four cultural profiles adopted from the Competing Values Framework and a set of operational performance indicators are used to operationalize the study. Findings – Culture does not appear to be an unequivocal predictor of the use of quality techniques. Furthermore, while most quality technique groups contribute indirectly to the total effect on operational performance in the developmental, group and hierarchical cultures, the performance effects are insignificant for all four groups in the rational culture. Practical implications – Managers need to be actively aware of the cultural characteristics of their organization before adopting quality techniques, in order to benefit most from the use of these techniques. Originality/value – Most previous studies address the relationships between culture, quality management and performance at the level of quality practices. This study takes the unitarist-pluralist discussion to the level of quality techniques and extends that discussion to what should be its core, namely, the influence of quality techniques on the performance impact of culture. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Operational performance; Organizational culture; Quality techniques; Structural equation modelling; Survey",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942510661

Design/methodology/approach – The authors propose a structural model for analysing specialised, cross-functional and dynamic capabilities at the functional level of marketing. The model is tested by using a quantitative survey among CMEs. Additionally the authors conducted a cluster analysis with the purpose of identifying differences in CMEs’ mindsets about important marketing capabilities and the impact of these differences on company performance. Findings – The study identified four categories of mindset about important capabilities. An investigation into the company performance profile of each mindset shows that integration and rejuvenation are central qualities of CMEs’ mindsets and important drivers for company performance. Hence, companies that have a CME who prioritises both brand management, product development and customer relationship management as well as a set of specialised and dynamic marketing capabilities will outperform companies that have a CME who focuses on only one area of cross-functional marketing capabilities. Practical implications – Top managers, including CMEs, can use the typology of mindsets to analyse and critically reflect on their own ideas about important marketing processes and capabilities, but also as a tool for initialising change processes in their business unit or particular function (general management or marketing).

The purpose of this paper is to identify the types of actors in the multilevel transnational food chain regulatory governance and how their interlinking affects regulatory outcomes over time. Design/methodology/approach – Food chain regulatory standards emerge within a complex process beyond the state. Based on interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives, namely regulatory governance and political economy, this paper provides a integrative framework of analysis by identifying the types of actors and their interactions in the food chain regulatory governance. Findings – Food chain regulatory standards setting have been mainly studied either from the public regulator or the firm self-regulating point of view. This paper demonstrates how the political and economics dynamics of the interactions among public and private actors operate within the transnational food standards setting process. The study identifies the groups of interdependent actors (public and private) that interact within the transnational food chain regulatory process and develop public-private regulations, self-regulations, and co-regulations over time. In this process, the actors’ different power, operational and regulatory capacity, experience, resources affect the regulatory outcome with socio-economic and governance implications. Research limitations/implications – The paper does not examine in detail how these interactions operate empirically on specific regulations. Practical implications – The paper offers an integrative thorough understanding of the food chain regulatory standard setting process, relevant for academics, policy makers, the industry, and society.

Increasingly, various actors contribute to the public remembering of organizations with new information and communication technologies (ICTs). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a global memory place, where the pasts of organizations are communicatively co-constructed by actors of a loosely connected community. Design/methodology/approach – The authors analyze 1,459 edits of Wikipedia pages of ten organizations from various industries. Quantitative content analysis detects Wikipedia edits for their reputational relevance and reference to formal sources, such as corporate communication or newspapers. Furthermore, the authors investigate to which degree current corporate communication in form of 177 press releases has an influence on the remembering process in Wikipedia. Findings – The analysis shows how the continuous construction of collective memories bridges past formal corporate communication, news media, and other sources with the present, exposing, and suppressing relevant information concerning corporate reputation for large audiences. The analysis of press releases shows that current frames provided by corporate communication finds only little resonance in the ongoing remembering processes in Wikipedia.

A cross-cultural survey in five countries contributes to closing this research gap. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach – What makes the research design innovative is that the questionnaire incorporates both practitioners’ perceptions of the cultural context and the relevance of CC practices. The sample comprises 418 practitioners from the most senior positions in CC in the biggest companies in Australia, Austria, Germany, Indonesia, and Switzerland. By choosing a systematic access to the field the authors circumvent shortcomings of “snowball” sampling techniques. Findings – While cultural perceptions and CC priorities vary to a certain degree, there are hardly any significant correlations between the two. Meanwhile, the “nation variable”, and the institutional settings associated with it, are more instructive when explaining differences in CC. Research limitations/implications – A large cross-cultural survey needs to take a “birds eye view” and, as such, is able to identify only general tendencies when describing relations between perceptions of culture and CC practices. Future case studies and qualitative research could explore more subtle ways in which CC is influenced not only by the cultural context, but also – and probably even more – by institutional environments. Originality/value – This is the first cross-cultural survey to systematically describe on the level of primary data, the links between CC practices and perceptions of the organisational environment. Since the results indicate only a limited impact of culture, the authors would recommend the rehabilitation of the “nation variable”. Provided it is understood and differentiated as a representation of specific institutional contexts, the nation variable is likely to prove highly instructive when accounting for the diversity of CC observed around the world. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Comparative research; Corporate communications; Culture",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942109393

We analyze how this perception relates to intrinsic motivation measured in a survey and sickness absence as reported in administrative registers, and find that individuals who perceive documentation requirements as controlling have lower intrinsic motivation and higher sickness absence. The association is statistically significant, but very small in substantive terms. The result is nevertheless consistent with the expectation in motivation crowding theory and contributes to the literature by including a new, reliable behavioral variable—sickness absence—and by drawing attention to possible downsides of command-and-control.

A signal can be the increasingly higher level of skilled labor migration from these countries, especially during the actual crisis. Recent literature on skilled migrations often rejects the concept of “brain drain” (BD) arguing that circulation and exchange of people and knowledge is expected in the era of globalization. Using both conceptual analysis and secondary data, the paper attempts to highlight proportions of the intra-EU BD phenomenon and show how they may challenge the assumptions of circular migration models. It discusses that a BD problem likely exists in the Southern Euro Zone and proposes an alternative framework for its analysis. The main hypothesis behind this review is that the phenomenon relies on substantial lack of social opportunities for high-skilled people in the countries of origin as provoked by multiple factors. In this account, the several drivers of migrants' choice will be conceptualized by adopting a “Capability Approach,” and they will be further analyzed according to its foremost hypotheses regarding rational behavior, human welfare, and development. The resulting theoretical view has to be considered as an expansion of the neoclassical economics “standard view” on high-skilled migrations. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","brain circulation; brain drain; brain exchange; brain gain; Capability Approach; Southern Euro Zone","brain drain; European Union; globalization; labor migration; skilled labor; theoretical study; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945467714

Boals and Murrell (in press) found that an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)-based, therapist-led treatment resulted in significant decreases in event centrality, which in turn led to decreases in PTSD symptoms. In the current study, a version of this treatment was administered using a modified expressive writing intervention. Participants were randomly assigned to learn core components about either ACT, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or baseball (control) via audio analogs. The ACT and CBT groups then attempted to apply what they learned in two subsequent expressive writing sessions, while the baseball group wrote about a neutral topic. The results revealed that participants in the ACT and CBT conditions evidenced significant decreases in event centrality, if they followed the writing instructions correctly, in comparison to the control group.

We investigate standard compliance by comparing the stated intention of the use of the GRI with its actual use and the consequent effects within the firm. Based on an in-depth case study, our findings illustrate the processes and consequences of the translation of the GRI within the organization. We show that substantive standard adoption can lead to unintended consequences on CSR management practices; specifically it can influence the management structure and CSR committee function; the choice of CSR activities, the relationships between subsidiaries, the temporal dimension of CSR management and the interpretation of CSR performance.

Next, the article shows that the effect is partly explained by differences in personal attributes such as empathy, systemizing, and competitiveness. Through these findings, the article contributes to the studies on representative bureaucracy by showing that gender not only affects bureaucratic behavior based on differences in interests but also on differences in attributes. Scholarly interest in the effects of gender should therefore not be restricted to ""gendered policy areas."" Likewise, scholars of public employee behavior should supplement its focus on differences in interests and policy preferences with a focus on differences in personal attributes and abilities. Otherwise, we run the risk of ignoring potential explanations for public employee behavior.

We demonstrate this by investigating a rare case of a large-scale radical public sector reform with low job insecurity, in which a large number of municipalities are merged into larger local governments, whereas other municipalities are not merged. This adds to previous research, which documents that organizational changes following public sector reform impact employee health negatively. We argue that a conceptual distinction between organizational change and job insecurity may explain the divergence from previous results. An important strength of our study is that the reform investigated can be considered a quasi-experiment, as it was exogenous and implemented simultaneously by the affected local governments. We also have access to an objective measure of the extent of organizational change, which is combined with objective measures of health outcomes from administrative data. The unique availability of high-quality longitudinal data combined with an exogenous reform provides a strong research design, which allows us to draw causal inferences. A number of robustness tests are performed, including propensity score matching and in-depth analysis of particular subgroups of public sector employees. The results indicate that profound organizational change per se does not necessarily lead to decreased health, if job insecurity is low. However, a very modest effect on long-term absenteeism is seen for employees coming from very small municipalities that have been merged into the newly formed organizations. © 2015 The Author.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943754923

Upon withdrawal of participation, persons used to having considerable influence reported more reactance.

Due to dominating social norms, SMEs form trust-based friendship networks, potentially limiting knowledge acquisition and weakening business rationality. Institutional pressures reinforce negative influences on SMEs' incentives to develop innovation ambidexterity.

In this article, we investigate whether politics still matters when bureaucratic preferences are taken into account. We do this in a simultaneous test of political and bureaucratic influences on public budgets, a policy measure often studied in the ""politics matters"" literature. We find that political preferences trump bureaucratic ones in policy areas salient to the public but not in less salient areas. This might be comforting news from a democratic perspective.

In this paper, we consider the question of how a firm can evaluate its patent portfolio for licensing purposes. To this end, we propose an approach that enables large corporations to scrutinize their portfolio of (patented) technologies and to subsequently set up royalty rate values to support the negotiation process of a particular technology. We use case-based research to develop our approach, which we illustrate with an in-depth assessment of 50 technologies. We conclude by discussing the pros and cons of our approach and its potential generalization to other companies and considering how it can be used to indicate value drivers for R&D strategy. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Licensing out; Market for technologies; R&D portfolio; Royalty rates; Technology assessment","Investments; Patents and inventions; Case-based researches; Depth assessment; Innovative companies; Market for technology; Negotiation process; Patent portfolio; Royalty rate; Technology assessments; Commerce; industrial investment; planning method; research and development; strategic approach; technological change; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938088470

Nevertheless, the majority of studies have not included soil carbon sequestration in the carbon footprint calculations. Especially in grasslands, soil carbon sequestration might be a potential sink to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the livestock sector. However, there is no commonly accepted methodology on how to include soil carbon sequestration in carbon footprint calculations. In this study, the carbon footprint of sheep milk was estimated from 12 farms in Northern Spain. Before taken into account contribution from soil carbon sequestration in the calculation, the carbon footprint values varied from 2.0 to 5.2 kg CO2 eq. per kg Fat and Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM). Milk from semi-intensive systems with foreign breeds kept indoors had significantly lower carbon footprint than milk from semi-extensive systems with local breeds and grazing in mountain uplands during summer. However, no difference was found in the carbon footprint of sheep milk from different systems and breeds when soil carbon sequestration was included in the calculations. Four different approaches to estimate and include soil carbon sequestration in the carbon footprint calculations were tested. This study highlights the importance of including soil carbon sequestration in the carbon footprint calculations. Furthermore, it highlights the climate mitigation potential of the grazing systems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aims to develop policy recommendations for rare disease centres of expertise (CoEs) in order to improve standards and quality of care. Subject and methods: A modified 3-round Delphi technique was used. Participants included rare diseases patients, carers, patient representatives and healthcare professionals (HCPs) from CoEs in two countries-Denmark and the UK. Results: The results suggest the need to make improvements within current CoE environments, access to CoEs and the need for coordination and cooperation of services within and outside CoEs. It is recommended that CoEs are not overly 'medicalised', while at the same time they should be established as research facilities. The importance of including patient representatives in CoE performance management was also highlighted. Raising awareness and provision of appropriate training amongst non-specialist HCPs is seen as a priority for early and correct diagnosis and ensuring high quality care. Similarly, provision of targeted information about patients' illness and care was considered essential along with access to social assistance within CoEs. Conclusions: Policy recommendations were developed in areas previously recognised as having gaps. Their implementation is expected to strengthen and improve current care provision for rare disease patients. In member states where national plans and strategies are being developed, it is recommended to replicate the methodological approach used in this study as it has proven to be a helpful tool in rare disease centres of expertise policy development. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Centre of expertise; Delphi technique; European reference network; Health policy; Rare disease","Delphi analysis; disease incidence; disease prevalence; European Union; health policy; policy approach; policy development; policy implementation; public health; service provision; standard (reference); Denmark; United Kingdom; caregiver; Delphi study; Denmark; Great Britain; health care policy; health care quality; health personnel attitude; health services research; human; organization and management; patient participation; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; rare disease; standards; Attitude of Health Personnel; Caregivers; Delphi Technique; Denmark; Great Britain; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Patient Participation; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Rare Diseases; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928613058

But is that the real picture-and has there been a change in how companies work within these fields over the past two years? By conducting interviews with eight companies, this paper tries to answer these two questions. The companies were initially interviewed in 2013 and by follow-up interviews in 2015 the paper draws a picture of how the companies work with UX and usability in an agile development environment. We identify the challenges they are facing and if, and how the work progresses. We found that the UX maturity during these two years had changed significantly. This was revealed by the fact that almost all of the companies in 2015 had implemented or were in the process of developing a UX strategy together with more formalized UX processes. They also allocated more resources to conduct UX and usability work than earlier. We found that all of the companies made use of low-fi prototyping, followed by usability testing, workshops, personas, expert evaluations, user or customer journeys, customer visits and user task analyses. Almost all the companies carried out development using the Scrum framework. All of the companies were interested in the idea of agile UX, and found the idea of using the developers as a UX resource interesting. This, together with an idea of modifying existing usability methods to be used in an agile, industrial setting could be a solution to bridge the gap between academia and the industry. © 2015 IEEE.","Agile Development; Industry; Usability; User Experience Design","Industry; Job analysis; Agile development; Agile development environments; Expert evaluation; Industrial settings; Usability; Usability methods; User experience design; User experiences (ux); Usability engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962086182

We are frequently using concepts such as innovation and entrepreneurship, and the way we perceive and define these concepts will to a high extent influence our way of thinking and acting. Depending on the way we define these concepts, we will tend to use different knowledge-bases when acting as policy-makers, or as researchers. Therefore, it becomes important to elaborate on the knowledge bases that we have within the fields of innovation and entrepreneurship. This study we elaborate on the question: Can innovation and entrepreneurship be seen as one or two fields of research? We will elaborate on this issue by comparing the core works in innovation and entrepreneurship studies respectively, as identified by Fagerberg et al. (Research Policy 41(7):1121–1131, 2012a) and Landström et al. (Research Policy 41(7):1154–1181, 2012), asking the questions: Who are the leading knowledge producers and the core works in the two fields? Are there overlaps in the literature used? and Can the existence or absence of overlaps tell us anything about to what extent innovation and entrepreneurship studies can be considered as two fields or parts of a single broader scientific field, sharing and contributing to the same knowledge base? The studies by Fagerberg et al. and Landström et al. are based on two unique databases consisting of all references in twelve “state-of-the-art” books in entrepreneurship studies and eleven books in innovation studies. The chapters in these “state-of-the-art” books are written by experts within the field, and it can be assumed that the most frequently cited references in these chapters represent “core knowledge” in entrepreneurship and innovation research. The study shows that we are talking about two more or less separate fields of research. Despite common roots in Schumpeter and some interrelated works, the two fields seem to have drifted apart over the last decades. However, there seems to be some elements of overlaps, for example, in the interest in the evolutionary approaches and in geographic differences in innovation and entrepreneurship, but also in an interest in topics such as innovation management (corporate entrepreneurship) and in technology-based ventures. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Entrepreneurship studies; Innovation studies; Knowledge base; New research fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938997267

How, for example, do consumers choose between environmentally friendly products or services and alternatives that are potentially damaging to the environment but less expensive? The answer may well depend on the default rule. Indeed, green default rules may be a more effective tool for altering outcomes than large economic incentives. The underlying reasons include the powers of suggestion, inertia, and loss aversion. If well-chosen, green defaults are likely to have large effects in reducing the economic and environmental harms associated with various products and activities. Such defaults may or may not be more expensive to consumers. In deciding whether to establish green defaults, choice architects should consider consumer welfare and a wide range of other costs and benefits. Sometimes that assessment will argue strongly in favor of green defaults, particularly when both economic and environmental considerations point in their direction. But when choice architects lack relevant information, when interest group maneuvering is a potential problem, and when externalities are not likely to be significant, active choosing, perhaps accompanied by various influences (including provision of relevant information), will usually be preferable to a green default. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

However, the potential for regions to create greater understanding in consumer research has been limited by researchers’ acceptance of geopolitical frontiers as the natural boundaries of cultural practices. We introduce critical regionalities and the archipelago metaphor as an analytic lens for interrogating and redrawing regional borders while preserving the benefits of a regional approach. Combining poststructuralist and critical historical perspectives, we argue for greater sensitivity to place and history in operationalizing regional consumer cultures. To illustrate this approach, we take Latin America as our point of departure and use examples from the central consumption areas of food and dwelling, for example, the consumption of rice and beans and the rise of gated communities. We contribute to recent theoretical developments in marketing and consumer culture theory with a flexible notion of regional consumer culture, paying critical attention to the relationship between analytical scales and researchers’ reflexivity. This approach also allows for more attention to non-Western contexts, ontologies, and epistemologies. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","Area studies; consumer culture; context; critical regionalities; gated communities; Latin America; marketing practices; regions; rice and beans",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940174252

The Danish pesticide taxes probably represent the world's highest pesticide taxes on agriculture, which makes it interesting to analyse how effective they have been. The analysis demonstrates the challenges of choosing an optimal tax design in a complex political setting where, additionally, individuals in the target group have different rationales when making decisions on pesticide use. It also demonstrates that a small first, green tax step over time might develop into a better tax design. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Developed-country multi-national companies (MNCs) are increasingly establishing subsidiaries in developing countries. The potential gains are high; however, so are the risks. While the issue of subsidiary performance should be at the heart of any international business (IB) enquiry into MNC activity in developing countries, surprisingly little research has examined this issue. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a comprehensive literature review of the IB performance literature, it is hypothesized that subsidiary performance essentially is shaped by five clusters of factors: location, industry, MNC capabilities, subsidiary role and entry strategy. These factors’ ability to explain variance in subsidiary performance is tested through a multiple regression analysis. Findings – MNC subsidiary performance in developing countries has improved enormously in recent decades. Especially, MNC capability and subsidiary role-related factors appear to explain variance in performance, while location factors appear to have less explanatory power. This suggests that strong MNC capabilities and organization can make MNCs succeed regardless of location. Practical implications – The key preparatory work for MNCs contemplating entry into developing countries is to carefully scrutinize internal capabilities and organization. Originality/value – The paper presents a model for explaining variation in subsidiary performance in developing countries specifically. The paper offers unique empirical insights into the state and drivers of subsidiary performance in developing countries. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","MNCs in developing countries; Subsidiary performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941347887

Furthermore, the analyses show that marketing can act as a driver for the company's engagement in product responsibility and social issues. The potential for marketing to further strengthen its role in driving corporate sustainability is made apparent.

However, full utilisation of production capacity is not always possible during ramp-up. In such cases, the experience gained and hence the available effective capacity are overestimated. We develop a new method, which captures ramp-up as a function of the cumulative production volume to better reflect the experience gained while producing the new product. The use of the more accurate and computationally effective approach is demonstrated for the case of secondary pharmaceutical production. Due to its regulatory framework, this industry cannot fully exploit available capacities during ramp-up. We develop a capacity planning model for a new pharmaceutical drug, which determines the number and location of new production lines and the build-up of inventory such that product availability at market launch is ensured. Our MILP model is applied to a real industry case study using three empirically observed ramp-up curves to demonstrate its value as decision support tool. We demonstrate the superiority of our volume-dependent method over the traditional time-dependent ramp-up functions and derive managerial insights into the selection of ramp-up function and the value of shortening ramp-ups. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","empirically observed curves; experience; learning; mixed-integer planning model; ramp-up; time- vs. volume-dependent","Decision support systems; Integer programming; empirically observed curves; experience; learning; Planning models; Ramp up; time- vs. volume-dependent; Learning systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938211684

SCM suffers as well as benefits from a “conceptual slack”. Design/methodology/approach – The nature of SCM is discussed, and the role and relevance of theorizing is addressed by using key characteristics of “academic scholarship” based on a literature review of SCM and evaluation of application of theory and theory development. Findings – The integrative and multi-layered nature of SCM sets the conditions for “theorizing SCM” that can take place through various forms: theory application, new theoretical combinations and sensitivity to managerial practice. It is pivotal that future research explore further the performative potential of SCM. Research limitations/implications – Research with focus on theory development or using complementary theories to advancing understanding of SCM can benefit from the five building blocks of theorizing SCM proposed in the paper. Practical implications – Theoretical principles in SCM are not only used to describe practical problems but also to “produce the world”; supply chains can be seen as organizational units that act or consummate an action that delivers a particular performance.

Thus, in order to provide an improved understanding of fashion store design, the purpose of this paper is to identify the most important store design variables, organise these variables into categories, understand the design constraints between categories, and determine the most influential stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a discussion of existing literature, the paper defines a framework of store design variables and constraints between these. The framework is investigated through six case studies of fashion store design projects. Findings – Through a discussion of literature and empirical studies, the paper: identifies the most important store design variables, organises these variables into categories, provides an understanding of constraints between categories of variables, and identifies the most influential stakeholders. The paper demonstrates that the fashion store design task can be understood through a system perspective, implying that the store design task becomes a matter of defining a set of subsystems, while considering their mutual interdependencies. Research limitations/implications – The proposed framework may be used as a point of departure and a frame of reference for future research into fashion store design.

Traditional gift-giving models suggest gift givers buy gifts for certain recipients on certain occasions. This study's journey into gift storage finds that some gift-giving practices are initially acquisition-less, recipient-less and/or occasion-less. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a convenience sample of 111, the main functions and motivations for gift storage are described. From a free elicitation process of gift-closet attributes, a first account of the symbolic meanings that gift storage is embedded in is provided. Findings – Seventy-seven per cent per cent of the sample had a gift closet where they stored gifts for which either the occasion or the recipient was not known at the time of acquisition. According to these gift-closet owners, the main purposes of gift closets are convenience, thrift and to have a place for surplus or shopping items. Social implications – While it makes sense to some consumers to prepare for future gift-giving occasions by stockpiling items in gift closets, the results indicate that storage may affect the symbolic value of the gift and, ultimately, the development of social ties. Consumers who gift from the closet believe that there are few negatives involved. However, people who do not have gift closets and receive gifts which they suspect are from storage may perceive a lack of caring and even feel insulted.

Two cases are described, representing on the one hand predominately positive experiences of streaming (better relations to teachers and peers) and on the other hand predominately negative experiences of streaming (low teacher expectations and negative peer-learning). Findings – The study shows that the two schools have organized streaming differently and that the students have very diverse experiences of being placed in a low-ability class depending on the way the schools organize streaming. Originality/value – The paper discusses the basic dilemma that schools face when they have to teach students with very diverse backgrounds and levels of engagement. The study shows that the division of students into separate streams involves a risk of reducing the level of engagement among students in the low-ability courses, but it also suggests how streaming can be organized to increase the engagement of students and possibly reduce their risk of dropping out of vocational education. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Drop-out; Organization of school; Streaming; Vocational education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941038146

Design/methodology/approach – An action research project conducted throughout one year in collaboration between the management groups of the Elderly Care in a Danish municipality, two organizational consultants and two researchers from the Department of Communication and Psychology at Aalborg University. The dialogical approach to group coaching is developed in the interaction between dialogue theory and the performance and close analysis of 12 video-taped coaching sessions with four management groups. The development of the dialogic group coaching concept is further supported through common reflections between researchers and groups in initial meetings as well as during the coaching sessions and final interviews, reflections between researchers and groups in initial meetings as well as during the coaching sessions and final interviews. Findings – The non-directive approach of dialogic group coaching is inspired by Transformative Mediation. This approach includes a focus on empowerment and recognition within the group in terms of promoting common reflection and learning. This also appears to diminish conflict talk and conflict-based relationships. Further, the dialogic approach emphasizes the importance of a coaching contract to create a common basis for reflection and action, which is found to reduce individual positioning.

Gender gaps pervade human activity. But little is known about forces reshaping gaps across career phases, from education to running a business. Such gaps may accumulate over one’s entrepreneurial career and widen or narrow due both to environmental forces that reconfigure the gap across career phases and to the gendering of competencies and benefits from education and training. Design/methodology/approach – A representative sample of 110,689 adults around the world was surveyed in the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. Gender-related effects were ascertained by odds ratios estimated by hierarchical modelling, controlling for country and attributes of individuals. Findings – Education and entrepreneurial training, both during and after formal schooling, are highly beneficial in developing competencies and during career phases - i.e. intending to start a business, starting a business, and running a business. Early gaps in human capital are reproduced as gaps in careers, and continuous disadvantages in the environment repeatedly widen gaps throughout a person’s entrepreneurial career. That said, gender gaps are reduced slightly over time as women gain greater benefit from training than men. Research limitations/implications – The cumulative effects of early gender gaps in education and training call for research on gendered learning, and recurrent gender effects across career phases call for research on gendering in micro-level contexts such as networks and macro-level contexts such as institutions. Practical implications – Understanding the gendering of human capital and careers has implications for policy and education aimed at developing human resources, especially for mobilising women. The finding that women gain greater benefit than men from training is informative for policies that foster gender equality and empower women pursuing careers. Originality/value – Conceptualising the entrepreneurial career as a sequence of several stages enables the assessment of gender gaps owing to initial disadvantages in education and to recurrent disadvantages on the career path. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Careers; Competencies; Education; Gaps; Training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940102776

Engaging with the consumer on an emotional level initiates a strong bond between the garment and wearer, thus increasing the longevity of the garment, which in turn becomes irreplaceable to the user. The fundamental philosophy behind this approach to sustainability is to produce and consume less and better products, and to design products from the idea of doing 'more in less'. To accomplish this, time and human presence are the key elements. The value of a luxury garment ought to depend on the following: the idea and the thoughts behind creating the product, the time spent producing the product, focusing on the way it is produced and by whom, and the long-term meaning it will bring to the life of the user. This genesis story has to be tangible and subsequently mediated to the consumer and more importantly experienced and appreciated by him or her as a valuable element of luxury. The concept of luxury fashion needs to be broadened and deepened from something that is widely related to status and image, toward something that concerns us in a deeper (emotional) sense. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.

The way a particular function of a building is provisioned may have significant repercussions beyond just resilience. The goal is to develop a decision support tool for facilities managers. Design/methodology/approach – A risk framework is used to quantify both resilience and sustainability in monetary terms. The risk framework allows to couple resilience and sustainability, so that the provisioning of a particular building can be investigated with consideration of functional, environmental, economic and, possibly, social dimensions. Findings – The method of coupling and quantifying resilience and sustainability (CQRS) is illustrated with a simple example that highlights how very different conclusions can be drawn when considering only resilience or resilience and sustainability. Research limitations/implications – The paper is based on a hypothetical example. The example also illustrates the difficulty in deriving the costs and probabilities associated with particular indicators. Practical implications – The method is generic, allowing the method to be customized for different user communities. Further research is needed to translate this theoretical framework to a practical tool for practitioners and to evaluate the CQRS method in practice.

Each chapter presents distinct approaches to disaster research that is anchored in a particular discipline; ranging from the law of disasters and disaster historiography to disaster politics and anthropology of disaster. The methodological and theoretical contributions underlining a specific approach to disasters are discussed and illustrative empirical cases are examined that support and further inform the proposed approach to disaster research. The book thus provides unique insights into fourteen state-of-the-art disciplinary approaches to the understanding of disasters.

This includes taking advantage of opportunities and using ones social capital through networks. It is a case study of Vandalorum which is an Swedish international art and design centre with a strong regional connection. They want to offer close collaborations between artists, designers and the creative industry. It is located in Värnamo in the south of Sweden and was inaugurated in April 2011 after an establishment process running over 15 years. Renzo Piano has created the architectural concept of Vandalorum, inspired by traditional Swedish materials and building techniques. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Through interviews with significant actors over many years and secondary analysis of data collected by others the authors describe and analyze the establishment process of Vandalorum Art and Design Centre. Findings – The case of Vandalorum shows that organizing a cultural project like Vandalorum is characterized by no well-defined starting and stopping point, but – quite typically for entrepreneurship as an organization-creation process – builds momentum and legitimacy narratively. Originality/value – The originality lies in answering the question that the authors chose to focus on, which is embedded in the opening story of Vandalorum: how can such a cultural project become legitimized in a place like that, outside and rather far from any large city? In a changed cultural landscape with reduced public contributions, the claim is that it is crucial to legitimize the idea and project in relation to the main/key stakeholders. Such legitimization is a key entrepreneurial achievement. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cultural entrepreneurship; Cultural industries; Legitimacy; Organization-creation; Vandalorum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958553080

Design/methodology/approach – Case study based on qualitative research interviews with the management team, combined with existing research on ECoC and documents on the Aarhus 2017 project. Findings – The first main finding is that the challenges are caused by the way in which the transition from applicant to designated ECoC includes a change in management, shifting from a project to a programme structure and change in organisation. The second main finding is that stakeholder management in relation to politicians and cultural agents is challenged by a high level of ownership and expectation. Research limitations/implications – The study focuses on just one case and one phase of the project. Practical implications – Consequences for the way ECoC are managed and the programme organised could be drawn from this. Originality/value – The originality of the work is in that it studies this very critical phase in the project’s life-cycle in great detail, and focuses specifically on the management of ECoC. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Arts management; Cultural projects; European Capital of Culture; Political prestige; Stakeholder management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958536637

The purpose of this paper is to reflect on, and further develops, the principal themes discussed in the “OM Theory” workshop in Dublin in 2011 and the special sessions at the 2011 and the 2013 EurOMA Conferences in Cambridge and Dublin. Design/methodology/approach – This paper presents six short essays that explore the role and use of theory in management research, and specifically ask what is a good or meaningful contribution to theory. The authors comment on the current state of theory in Operations Management (OM) (Harry Boer), the type of theories the authors have in OM (Chris Voss), the role of theory in increasing the general understanding of OM problems (Roger Schmenner), whether the authors can borrow theories from other fields or actually have theory “of our own” (Matthias Holweg), the different ways in which a contribution to theory can be made (Martin Kilduff), and how to construct a theoretical argument (Mark Pagell). Findings – The authors argue that theory is fundamental to OM research, but that it is not the inevitable starting point; discovery and observation are equally important and often neglected avenues to contributing to theory. Also, there is no one right way to making a contribution, yet consistency between ontology, epistemology, and claimed contribution is what matters. The authors further argue that the choice of theory is critical, as a common mistake is trying to contribute to high-level theories borrowed from other fields. Finally, the authors recommend using theory parsimoniously, yet with confidence. Originality/value – The paper presents a collection of viewpoints of senior scholars on the need for, and use of, theory in OM research. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Advanced manufacturing technology (AMT); Agility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942098003

Design/methodology/approach – On the basis of the literature, the paper creates an analytical framework identifying the main constructs related to the PE and S&OP design, which is the basis for gathering and analysing qualitative data from eight cases in the food industry. The findings highlight the relations between S&OP and the PE, and are used for generating three propositions. Findings – Responding to the complex and uncertain PE, the companies set up S&OP on a stockkeeping unit (SKU) level, with the possibility of re-planning and a flexible planning horizon, thus differing from what has generally been suggested in the literature. In addition, the companies are aligning the inputs, activities, and outcomes of the S&OP process to the PE. Particularly important environmental contingencies are uncertainty connected to demand and supply, frequent product launches, and production network complexity. Product-related variables have a lower impact on the S&OP design. Research limitations/implications – The present study is limited to one industry only and a comparison between industries with larger data sets would be valuable in future studies. The study selected cases based on their S&OP maturity; further studies need to explore the effect of the alignment of S&OP and the PE on the planning performance. Originality/value – In the literature, S&OP is presented as a generic process with a strict formal design that is equal for all companies. The study provides insights into how companies adjust S&OP according to the PE. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case study; Food industry; Planning environment; Process parameters; Sales and operations planning (S&OP); Set up parameters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939780923

Design/methodology/approach - The analysis combines recipes, dietary records and food waste data from a school meal intervention with collected price data within an economic optimization framework. Findings - A New Nordic School meal programme consisting of a morning snack and a hot lunch based on fixed seasonal menu plans and with 75 per cent organic content is 37 per cent more expensive in terms of ingredient costs than corresponding packed school meals. This cost differential can be almost halved by introducing more flexible scheduling of week plans and reducing the level of organic ambition to 60 per cent. Reducing portion sizes could reduce the cost differential by an extra 5 per cent, which would also reduce food waste by about 15 per cent. Originality/value - Higher costs and food waste in a restrictive ingredient sourcing school meal programme can be reduced by increased flexibility in meal scheduling, reduction in organic content and reduced average portion size. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cost analysis; Economics; Meals; New Nordic Diet; Organic foods; Schools; Waste minimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938634127

In previous institutional research, it has been conventional to treat professionals as agents of firms or transnational organizations, and institutional change as the result of planned, strategic 'professional projects'. By bringing a relational analysis to bear on the problem of institutional change, this study reasserts the theoretical significance of individual agency and everyday interactions between professionals and their clients, peers, and organizational environment. It also broadens the model of agency to include invention and improvisation by individual professionals, as a counterpart to collective strategic action. The argument is based on data from a 16-nation study exploring the emergence of a particular 'globalized localism': the transformation of the asset-holding trust from a tool of medieval English landowners into a mainstay of contemporary international finance. Drawing on interviews with 61 wealth management professionals in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas, this article uses their accounts of the diffusion and deployment of trusts to specify a new, more detailed model of the ways local practices and ideas develop into global institutions. © 2015 The Author(s) 2015.

This change involves new payment service providers entering this lucrative market, and meanwhile, the existing stakeholders are trying to defend their oligopolistic positions. The mobile payment market cooperation (MPMC) framework in this article shows how the digitalization of payments, as a technology innovation, affects the competition and collaboration among traditional and new stakeholders in the payment ecosystem at three levels of analysis. We do this by integrating theories of market cooperation with the literatures on business and technology ecosystems. The MPMC framework depicts technology-based market cooperation strategies in the context of recent battles in the mobile payments ecosystem. In these battles, the competitors can use technology either in defensive build-and-defend strategies to protect market position, or in offensive battering-ram strategies for ecosystem entry or position improvement. Successful strategies can lead to: (1) Ricardian rents, based on operational efficiency advantages traceable to the firm's position relative to suppliers and monopoly power; and (2) Bainian rents, resulting from the extent the firm is able to resist price competition in the market. We validate the framework that we propose through three case studies of technology-based market cooperation in the mobile payments ecosystem. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Case study; iZettle; Market cooperation; Mobile payment; Payment ecosystem; Payment markets; PayPal; SMS payment","Competition; Electronic money; Global system for mobile communications; Mobile telecommunication systems; Co-operation strategy; iZettle; Mobile payment; Mobile payment market; Operational efficiencies; PayPal; Technology ecosystem; Technology innovation; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944179270

The substantial complexity of organizations, work practice and physical environments within the healthcare sector influences the development and application of health IT. When health IT is introduced in local clinical work practices, potential patient safety hazards and insufficient support of work practices need to be examined. Qualitative methods, such as clinical simulation, may be used to evaluate new technology in correlation with the clinical context and to study the interaction between users, technology and work practice. Compared with the ""classic"" methods, such as heuristic inspection and usability testing, clinical simulation takes the clinical context into account. Clinical simulation can be useful in many processes in the human-centred design cycle. In the requirement specification, clinical simulation can be useful to analyze user requirements and work practice as well to evaluate requirements. In the design of health IT, clinical simulation can be used to evaluate clinical information systems and serve as common ground to help to achieve a shared understanding between various communities of practice. In a public procurement process, a clinical simulationbased assessment can help give insight into different solutions and how they support work practice.

The choice of tactic depends on how decision makers perceive the available evidence. All tactics involve the use of judgment. We also identify a number of devices employed to enable such judgments. Our study shows that although evidence is not playing its designated role in evidence-based management, it nevertheless plays a central role in the IT prioritization process. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study sets out to study one case of blame allocation by describing and characterizing the origins of failure and antecedents leading to the need for blame allocation, the institutional entities and arrangements that participate in the blame game, and how these entities, including the supreme audit institution, are mobilized in the processes of blame allocation. Applying a case methodology with Actor-Network Theory principles, the study extends Hood's (2002, 2007) research on blame and blame avoidance strategies by showing how a blame-frame evaluates and allocates blame. The contribution of the paper is in four parts: first, it reveals the mechanisms that cause scapegoating of particular people and the role of auditors as experts in such mechanisms; second, it assists to develop an understanding of some factors at the core of the ""accountability paradox"" noted by Roberts (2009); third, it contributes to explanations as to why failing public sector reforms survive controversy and scandal since a scapegoating process can ""reboot"" reforms by erasing the reform's problems; and fourth, it demonstrates that an understanding of blame can be a useful addition to Actor-Network Theory. © 2015 The Canadian Academic Accounting Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941120471

Using a randomized survey experiment with 528 law students, this article shows how low-intensity treatments may activate PSM and how the effect of PSM activation efforts compares with efforts to activate another, less self-determined type of motivation (relating to the need for feelings of self-importance). The findings are robust and suggest that low-intensity efforts to activate PSM have a positive effect on an individual's behavioral inclinations.

The article offers an overview of the developments within the field of consumer or consumption experience with stress on “consumer culture theory” (CCT) and discusses how this research could contribute to alternative and complementary ideas for conceptualizing tourist experiences as presented in tourism literature. Within the latter, the home/strangerhood-perspective and the perspective of traveling in time and space are referred to in particular. The article describes how movements in the early 1980s have been imperative for the now comprehensive focus on experiences within consumer research, and elucidates the emergence of and the contributions from two main approaches within CCT, the individual and the sociocultural approach. The authors suggest that tourist experience is about how meaning is created and argue that meaning creation is constituted by a mixed configuration of individual, social, and cultural meaning. It is finally suggested that the CCT research can offer significant contributions to extend the understanding of tourists' movements in time and space between different experience arenas both in an ontological and in an epistemological sense. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","consumer experiences; consumer research; experiential turn; tourism; tourist experiences","conceptual framework; tourism; tourist behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941170400

This is due to the ubiquitous nature of the topic. Power is shaped by a variety of institutional factors, including the architecture of governing structures, questions of scale and level, and access to key resources including knowledge and capital, among other factors. To date, there are relatively few tools available that allow policy makers, researchers, and development practitioners to render these power dynamics explicit and thus take steps to mitigate the potentially deleterious effects of power orientations. This paper proposes a methodology, multi-level stakeholder influence mapping (MSIM), for elucidating power dynamics between actors in complex system regimes. MSIM departs from existing power mapping techniques in that it relies on individual interviews conducted across multiple actor levels and utilizes a participatory mapping process for shared system boundary critique. MSIM was piloted in Nepal’s agricultural climate change adaptation regime with actors from the central, regional, and local operational levels. The results suggest that without proper consideration of the role of power in agricultural adaptation regimes, the resulting interventions will likely be insufficient in catalyzing adaptation pathways and moderating the negative impacts of climate change. Furthermore, power analyses produced from the perspective of a single actor level or respondent type can risk sub optimization of adaptation outcomes and can misdirect the lobbying efforts of those agencies utilizing mapping outputs. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Influence; Mapping; Nepal; Power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938984911

Countries such as Denmark with centrally organized well fare systems, free access to health services and individual tracking based on unique personal identification may in particular contribute to our understanding of the reasons for this increase. Based on Danish registers we aimed to examine the geographical patterns of the distribution of ADHD diagnosis and medication use and explore the association with access to diagnostic services, diagnostic culture, neighbourhood socioeconomic status and municipal spending on health care for children. Methods: We combined information on registered diagnosis of ICD-10 Hyperkinetic Disorder and ADHD medication use in a Danish register-based cohort of children born between 1990 and 2000. We mapped incidence proportions of diagnoses and medication use within the 98 Danish Municipalities. Global and local clustering of ADHD was identified using spatial analysis. Information on contextual factors in the municipalities was obtained from national registers. The associations between the incidence of ADHD and contextual factors were analysed using Bayesian spatial regression models. Results: We found a considerable variation in the incidence of ADHD across the municipalities. Significant clustering of both high and low incidence of ADHD was identified and mapped using the local Moran's I. Clustering of low incidence of diagnosis and medication use was observed in less populated areas with limited diagnostic resources and in contrast clustering of high incidence in densely populated areas and greater diagnostic resources. When considering the spatial autocorrelation between neighbouring municipalities, no significant associations were found between ADHD and access to diagnostic services, different diagnostic culture, socioeconomic status at municipality level or the municipal spending on health care for children. Conclusions: A large geographical variation of ADHD in the municipalities was observed despite tax-financed and free access to healthcare. Although not statistically significant, results indicate that accessibility to diagnostic resources might explain some of the variation in ADHD incidence. In contrast to US studies the observed variation was not statistically associated to contextual factors in terms of SES, municipal spending on health care for children or differences in diagnostic practices. © 2015 Madsen et al.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Diagnostic resources; Geographic variation; GIS; Incidence proportion; Spatial analysis","cohort analysis; disease incidence; disease prevalence; GIS; health care; health services; medical geography; mental health; public spending; socioeconomic status; spatial analysis; Denmark; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Bayes theorem; child; Denmark; economics; geographic mapping; health care delivery; human; incidence; preschool child; public health; register; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Denmark; Geographic Mapping; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Incidence; National Health Programs; Registries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939559344

Recent research embeds the uncertain nature of renewable sources by modelling electricity markets as a two-stage stochastic problem, co-optimizing day-ahead and real-time dispatch. In this framework, we introduce a bilevel model to derive the optimal bid of a strategic wind power producer acting as price-maker both in day-ahead and real-time stages. The proposed model is a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC) that is reformulated as a single-level Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), which can be readily solved. Our analysis shows that adopting strategic behaviour may improve producer's expected profit as the share of wind power increases. However, this incentive diminishes in power systems where available flexible capacity is high enough to ensure an efficient market operation. © 2015 IEEE.","Electricity markets; mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC); price-maker; stochastic programming; wind power","Commerce; Costs; Integer programming; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Wind power; Flexible capacity; Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints; Mixed integer linear program; Power system operators; price-maker; Real time dispatches; Renewable energies; Stochastic problems; Power markets",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951950235

In this context, Demand Response programs provide mechanisms to regulate the power demand through load control according to conditions of the supply side, where consumers can efficiently schedule the operation of their appliances. This paper has proposed an efficient local load scheduling optimization strategy for residential multi-class multi-constraint appliances by shifting and interrupting load requests to flatten the aggregated consumption. One scenario for each smart house, including the desirable usage schedule of its appliances in a 24-hour period, is considered. The proposed strategy has supposed a time-independent constant electricity consumption threshold, imposed by the grid stability management, in each time interval. The demand response system attempts to optimally schedule the received load requests over time, aiming at flattening the aggregated consumption meanwhile, maximizing satisfaction of consumers. The results have indicated that decreasing the electricity consumption threshold up to 60% of the maximum peak demand results in significant aggregated consumption flattening and also admissible delay in appliance reception. © 2015 IEEE.","Load Management; Scheduling; Smart Grid; Supply and Demand","Aggregates; Commerce; Economics; Electric load management; Electric power transmission networks; Electric power utilization; Housing; Power markets; Scheduling; Demand response programs; Electricity-consumption; Energy industry; Multi-class appliances; Multi-constraints; Smart grid; Supply and demand; Time independents; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951913466

In evaluating horizontal mergers among energy network operators, regulators must use different tools to evaluate the attractiveness of mergers. Norway is one country having implemented an ex ante regulation for mergers among electricity distribution operators (DSOs). We investigate whether the actual mergers of Norwegian DSOs in the period 1995-2004 can be rationalized as cost saving exercises or whether they should be interpreted in other ways. We use Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to estimate the potential cost savings from mergers ex ante, and we decompose the gains into gains from learning best practice and from improving economies of scale and scope. Moreover, we compare the sources of post merger performance to identify plausible pre-merger motivations. We also discuss the possibility to gain from strategic gaming in the regulation. We compare the regulated revenues and the regulated efficiency improvement requirements before and after the mergers. We find limited potential cost gains ex ante but some improvement in allocative efficiency ex post. Moreover, merged companies show more rapid technological progress and catch up. We also find that the new companies face somewhat more favourable regulatory conditions, i.e. higher allowed revenues and fewer required efficiency improvements. The latter is the consequence of a flawed specification of the regulatory cost function at the time. © 2015 IEEE.","DEA; efficiency; mergers; networks; Regulation","Commerce; Cost functions; Costs; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Efficiency; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Merging; Networks (circuits); Power markets; Allocative efficiency; DEA; Efficiency improvement; Electricity distribution; mergers; Regulation; Regulatory conditions; Technological progress; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951912979

Crucially, little attention has been paid to the Global South, either as a place where celebrities intervene into existing politics and social processes, or as the generator of Southern celebrities engaged in 'do-gooding'. This book examines what the diverse roster of celebrity humanitarians are actually doing in and across North and South contexts. Celebrity humanitarianism is an effective lens for viewing the multiple and diverse relationships that constitute the links between North and South. New empirical findings on celebrity humanitarianism on the ground in Thailand, Malawi, Bangladesh, South Africa, China, Haiti, Congo, US, Denmark and Australia illustrate the impact of celebrity humanitarianism in the Global South and celebritization, participation and democratization in the donor North. By investigating one of the most mediatized and distant representations of humanitarianism (the celebrity intervention) from a perspective of contextualization, the book underscores the importance of context in international development. This book will be of interest to students and researchers in the fields of development studies, celebrity studies, anthropology, political science, geography, and related disciplines. It is also of great relevance to development practitioners, humanitarian NGOs, and professionals in business (CSR, fair trade) who work in the increasingly celebritized field. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Lisa Ann Richey; individual chapters, the contributors.

The failure of the international community to reach significant global agreements on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has led local governments, environmental organisations and citizens themselves to focus increasingly on the local possibilities for action on climate change. This book analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the co-production of climate policies that take place where citizen engagement and local initiatives converge with public agencies. Case studies from Northern Europe, Australia/New Zealand and the USA reveal that traditional individualist approaches to promoting environmental behaviour epitomised by information campaigns and economic incentives cannot trigger the deep behavioural changes required to materially improve our response to climate change. Only by marshalling the forces of thousands, and eventually millions of citizens, can we manage to reach environmental sceptics, reinforce political action and create the new social norms that are sorely needed in our local, and global, response to climate change. This book will be of great relevance to scholars and policy makers with an interest in climate change politics and governance, community engagement and sustainable development. © 2016 selection and editorial matter, Jens Hoff and Quentin Gausset; individual chapters, the contributors.

The lead market approach tries to explain why certain countries are better positioned than others for developing and launching new products. While much research stresses the role of excellence in technology and interaction among users and producers, the lead market approach focuses on the role of demand characteristics. Based on the concept of innovation design, a lead market is defined as a country where customers prefer that design which subsequently becomes the globally dominant design. We use an indicator-based approach which has been successfully employed for individual products as well as for various industries in order to identify lead markets in the European automotive industry. Employing five lead market factors, our results show that the EU is by far no homogeneous market for automobiles and national markets differ considerably in their lead market potential. The German market is found to be most promising to serve as a lead market, while other European countries with a strong automotive tradition like France, Italy, the UK, and Sweden score lower. Our findings suggest that firms from the automotive industry should exploit this diversity of market characteristics within Europe when developing and launching new products. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","automotive industry; Europe; Lead markets","automobile industry; design; European Union; innovation; market development; France; Italy; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947227099

Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a preliminary framework for analysis of patient involvement in health care. This framework is used to analyze key governance features of patient involvement in Denmark based on previous research papers and reports describing patient involvement in Danish health care. Findings – Patient involvement is important in Denmark at the rhetorical level, and many policies and initiatives have been introduced. All three governance forms (voice, choice and co-production) are used. However, there are important barriers and limitations in translating the rhetoric into practice, and potential synergy and negative synergy effects can be identified when pursuing the strategies at the same time. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed framework further. Practical implications – The paper includes implications for the development of patient involvement in health care.

Design/methodology/approach – Based on a survey among top-500 Danish companies, the paper tests in SEM the relationships between ERM, participative leadership style and psychological safety on risk performance Findings – The paper finds that not only do both ERM and participative leadership style enhance risk performance but a positive interaction effect is also found. In addition, the findings suggest that a safe environment precede participative leadership style indicating this as a prerequisite for management to introduce participative leadership style. These findings underpin that an effective risk management system should include both a holistic, formalised ERM system and organisational initiatives that enhance a strategic responsiveness through employee involvement. Originality/value – The current study provides new empirical insights about the effect of a formal ERM process on risk performance as well as cultural factors for ERM success. As something new to the risk management literature, it draws on leadership and employee voice theory and investigates participative leadership style and psychological safety for employee voice as contextual influences on the effect of a formal ERM process on risk performance. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Autonomy; Participation; Performance; Risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939441993

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Conventional treatment of wastewater from the metal finishing industry is generally based on physical-chemical treatment. Although the effluents from this can be discharged directly there is an increasing interest in industrial wastewater reuse. This requires further wastewater treatment. Here we studied the technical and economic feasibilities of adding an ultrafiltration process as a pre-treatment for removing dissolved and colloidal contaminants &gt;0.4 μm, and to eliminate membrane fouling before a final reverse osmosis process resulting in permeate that would meet reuse criteria. The results show that the ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis treatment removed between 91.3% and 99.8% of the contaminants from the effluent, such as metal elements, organic, and inorganic compounds. Contaminants such as suspended solids, nickel, ammonium nitrogen, sulphate nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, and biochemical oxygen demand were completely removed, the concentrations in the permeate being under the detection limits, thus the quality of the ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis process met the reuse criteria. This demonstrates the technological feasibility of wastewater reuse during electro-plating processes and the pre-treatment of powder coating processes. An economic feasibility analysis was performed based on a reuse capacity for 30,000 m3 per year of treated water for two selected production lines at the Gorenje facility at Velenje, Slovenia. Specifically, the current water costs (including the operational costs of wastewater treatment, potable water use for industrial process and pre-treatment, and taxes) were compared with the investment required to implement the ultrafiltration-reverse osmosis processes. Based on the presented scientific results, the analysis shows that there is a potential for implementing this process within the metal finishing industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper culminates with a research model based on this theoretical perspective to examine the input and output of product returns management as part of a comprehensive sustainability effort. The study is exploratory in nature based on five case studies of participating manufacturers in the automotive, and electrical and electronics industry in Malaysia. The interview results reveal that the five participating companies established a product returns management program to handle three types of product returns found in their organizations. This is not surprising because successful product returns management has a number of internal and external benefits to the firms. Our interviews also uncover that the abundant amount of product returns is pressing these companies to implement an effective product returns management program.

An integral part of the study involved estimating GHG emissions from production of hay in a climate less favourable for field drying. The GHG emission was estimated using life cycle assessment (LCA) with kg of milk and kg of energy-corrected milk (ECM) delivered to the dairy and kg of cheese at the retailer as functional units (FU). Allocation at farm gate, between milk and meat, was made according to the biological relation between energy requirement for milk and meat production or as an economic allocation. Allocation at the dairy, between cheese and whey, was made either as an economic allocation or by system expansion. Inventory data were based on farm, herd and crop production data from commercial farms participating in research activities with controlled production of hay, in combination with either production information from cheese processing or literature estimates, all built into a static model. There was no effect on GHG emission per kg cheese of the proportion of herbs in the hay, but an effect of breed was found. The carbon footprint (CF) per kg cheese was lowest - 9.88 kg CO2 eq. - for milk from the Jersey herd compared with 12.1 and 12.7 from the two Holstein herds, although the GHG emission per kg milk at farm gate was highest from Jersey, but this was more than offset by a higher utilisation of Jersey milk for cheese production. The GHG emission from farm to retailer contributed less than 10% to total emissions, with the largest contribution from the energy used for cheese manufacture at the dairy, including storage. Methane was the largest source at approximately 50%, followed by feed production and the rearing of heifers. Use of energy for hay-drying added 7-8% to emissions and soil carbon change on average 3%, with some variation between farms. The sensitivity analysis showed that higher herb content could potentially reduce methane emissions by 6-7%, while the herbs' larger roots had only a marginal effect on GHG emissions from soil carbon at product level. If the feed conversion in Holstein breeds was assumed the same as in Jersey, the difference in emission per kg cheese due to breed was reduced but still lower from Jersey, which illustrates the positive effect of Jersey milk composition on cheese production efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprint (CF); Cheese; Dairy breeds; Forbs; Hay; Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Carbon footprint; Cheeses; Cultivation; Dairy products; Digital storage; Drying; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Methane; Sensitivity analysis; Cheese processing; Energy requirements; Forbs; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methane emissions; Production efficiency; Research activities; Dairies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930376662

In spite of this increasing importance of horizontal LSP cooperations, little research has been done to reveal how to govern these relationships successfully. Particularly, the role of contractual governance and its interplay with operational governance mechanisms remain to be investigated. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This research analyzes the influence of contractual governance on the effectiveness of two types of operational governance (a formal and a relational type). It relates contractual governance and operational governance to two major outcome dimensions of horizontal cooperations between LSPs (cooperation-based firm performance and cooperation-based learning) and uses multivariate statistical methods. Findings - The results reveal that contractual safeguarding is able to partly replace process formalization when aiming for better cooperation-based firm performance and complement process formalization when aiming for cooperation-based learning. At the same time, relational capital is always complemented by contractual safeguarding independently from the desired cooperation outcome. Originality/value - This is the first study analyzing the role of contractual safeguarding in horizontal cooperations between LSPs. It shows its interplay with operational governance mechanisms, and, thereby, not only considers a relational type of operational governance, but also a formal type. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Contractual safeguarding; Empirical study; Governance; Horizontal cooperation; Logistics service providers; Transaction cost economics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937907368

In our review and critique of this reception of liminality in organization studies, we emphasize that liminality involves a fundamental suspension of ordinary social structures. Although the prevailing use of the concept in anthropology as well as in organization studies has conceptualized liminality as a temporary state, we focus on permanent liminality. Yet the idea of permanent liminality leads to an inevitable paradox, because the concept, by definition, is a temporary state. Conceptualizing liminality as a constant state of social limbo, we show that the paradox in permanent liminality stems from the impossibility of drawing clear distinctions between different social spheres, especially as they apply to modern work–life. Examining a case study about a management consultant, we illustrate the paradox of liminality in terms of a zone of indistinction between work and life as it is reflected in an empirical self-narrative about a consultancy ‘lifestyle’. We further link these findings to a possible transition from disciplinary societies to societies of control. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","liminality; management consultancy; societies of control; zone of indistinction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937631808

However, in the consumer research of Eastern countries, such as Singapore, Taiwan, and Mainland China, the results showed that the FRL instrument was not completely suitable in an Eastern context. Food researchers considered that the FRL instrument should be modified in the Eastern context. Thus, the purpose of this research is to use the modified FRL instrument to segment Chinese consumers. There are 897 valid questionnaires, which were collected from Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. After using the two-stage cluster analysis, Chinese food consumers are divided into five parts: uninvolved consumers (13.0%), health-concerned consumers (20.4%), adventurous consumers (13.4%), urban consumers (33.3%), and traditional consumers (19.8%). Significant differences of supermarket images are found among segments based on food-related lifestyle. The results showed that health-concerned consumers and adventurous consumers have higher evaluations of supermarket image, while uninvolved and urban consumers are dissatisfied with supermarket image.

The motivational and (safety) behavioural implications of social identification and social categorization among construction labourer work crews were investigated to ascertain how their interactions are affected by the social structure and organization of work. Semi-structured group interviews and mini interviews during work were carried out with 13 concrete work crews (totalling 53 persons) at five large construction sites. The organization of work fosters social identification within a crew, resulting in distancing from and social categorization of site management. Social identification influences safety behaviour in the crews, where worksite safety rules may meet resistance. Future safety initiatives at large construction sites should take into account the dynamics of social identification and categorization in the implementation of safety measures, e.g. by creating an alternative organization of work, thus making it easier for a work crew to identify themselves with the site management. Site/crew managers should consider how safety can become a salient and valued group norm by altering the social structure at the sites and/or fostering dual social identity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Group dynamics; interviews; safety management; work-related injuries","Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Occupational risks; Construction sites; Group dynamics; interviews; Safety behaviours; Safety initiatives; Safety management; Social identification; Work-related Injuries; Accident prevention; construction industry; perception; safety; social structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944073305

This research presents the managers’ view on the role of business schools in training students in business ethics, and the managers’ evaluation of business schools’ success in that area.

The model allows the firm to adjust its position in response to partial learning about a changing environment characterized by two path-dependent processes - a random walk and a stochastic trend. Computational simulations at low levels of learning in both environmental contexts are consistent with empirical data. However, the results are also consistent when firm behavior appears to be mindless in the form of a random walk. Hence, both imperfect learning and a mindless random walk can lead to the inverse longitudinal risk-return relationships observed empirically. We discuss this apparent paradox and the possible resolution between mindless and conscious behavior as plausible causes of the longitudinal Bowman Paradox.

Environmental laws force the manufacturers to extend their existing supply chains to form a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) through the setup of an efficient recovery system. In this paper, we attempt to deal with the environmental issues presented in the design of CLSC networks. The CLSC network proposed in the paper consists of four echelons in the forward chain and five echelons in the backward chain. To consider the environmental issues in the proposed CLSC network, we formulate a bi-objective integer nonlinear programming problem, and in order to solve it we propose an Interactive Multi- Objective Programming Approach Algorithm. This model determines the optimal flow of parts and products in the CLSC network and the optimum number of trucks hired by facilities in the forward chain of the network. A numerical experimentation of the proposed model to validate the applicability of the model is done with the help of data from a real life case study. The case presented in the paper is based on a geyser manufacturer, and its application on the model provides us with the underlying tradeoffs between the two objectives. The model also results in a very interesting fact that with the implication of the extended supply chain, a firm can create a green image of their product which eventually results in an increase in their demand while significantly reducing their usage of transportation in both directions. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Relatively little attention has been paid to the returns from attempting self-employment while acknowledging that the decision to try self-employment is reversible. But this is the option considered by the worker deciding whether to become self-employed, as are any resulting positive or negative changes to the worker's wages, hours worked, or likelihood of job or business termination and resulting unemployment. The full consequences of attempting self-employment are determined by comparing the actual income streams of individuals who do and who do not attempt self-employment. Selection on observables is controlled by employing nearest-neighbor matching with bias correction. The main result is that there is no significant evidence that individuals who attempt self-employment are punished for doing so: after 15. years, those who attempt self-employment receive an (insignificant) 8% and a (significant) 22% premium in labor income and in labor and asset income, respectively. The consequences of attempting self-employment vary by occupation: individuals in technical and professional occupations realize significant gains, of 45% to 62% after 15. years, whereas craftsmen see no significant differences in income. Quantile treatment effects on the treated are estimated and reveal that the average positive premiums are driven by the upper tail of the treatment effect distribution. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Entry; Matching; Self-employment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928681117

The paper suggests that the authors instead of co-creation and progression draw on a dialectical approach and understand the development of government social media practices as a wrestling with contradictions. The case of emerging social media practices in a Danish municipality used to illustrate this framework suggests three main categories of contradictions in emerging social media practices: Contradictions between service administration and community feeling as forms of practice, contradictions in organizing between local engagement and central control, and contradictions in the digital infrastructure between proprietary municipal websites and public social media platforms. The paper discusses if a paradox lens will enhance our understanding of inherent contradictions or the dialectical notion of contradiction serve the purpose.

Locationaware technologies allow people to access, annotate, address and attach information to locations, which transforms the space for other people who use the same services. Such locations acquire relevance and reshape social and spatial interactions through increased use on social media as people 'check-in' to places, photograph or 'like' them. Collectively the authors are marking-up the city around them. The popularization of location-aware technologies thus contributes to the changing meaning of locations in cities. In contrast to the technological focus in the emerging discourses on smart cities and big data, this paper offers an alternative view of the three lenses of Social, Local and Mobile technologies that describe and explain crowd-sourced socio-technical layers on the city landscape. The proposed integrated theoretical model describes the relevant information linkages between people and places in the online and offline worlds and introduces a new evaluation method for the evaluation of city places: affinity spectrum of social endorsements.

Rather than treating the roller derby field as an autonomous enclave of gender resistance, this study focuses on the interrelationships between derby grrrls’ resignifying performances of femininity and the gender constraints that have been naturalized in their everyday lives. The market-mediated nature of derby grrrls’ ideological edgework enables them to challenge orthodox gender boundaries, without losing sociocultural legitimacy. This analysis casts new theoretical light on the gendered habitus and reveals key differences to the outcomes that would follow from Bourdieusian assumptions about the deployment of cultural capital in zero-sum status competitions. The concept of ideological edgework also presents a theoretical alternative to critical arguments, such as the commodity feminism thesis, that assume an inherently paradoxical and, ultimately co-opting, relation- ship exists between practices of countercultural resistance and marketplace performances. We further argue that ideological edgework redresses some of the conceptual ambiguities that can lead gender researchers to conflate gender performativity with social performances. © The Author 2015.

During recent years, coopetition has become an important domain for industrial practice which has led to an increasing rate of publications in academic journals. Despite the growing interest, coopetition research is still fragmented, reflected by divergent uses of the coopetition concept, a lack of generalizability, and a limited contextual focus. This article presents a systematic literature review and a synthesis of high-quality contributions in this field with a focus on a general overview of research on coopetition, coopetition as a strategy, and the management of coopetition. By critically evaluating the current body of literature and definitions, and connecting it to other promising domains, we develop a new definition of coopetition and highlight several promising areas for future research, such as the elaboration of theoretical and empirical approaches, the consideration of contextual contingencies, and implications for innovation that involves interorganizational knowledge flow. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cooperation and competition; Coopetition; Interorganizational relationships; State-of-the-art; Systematic review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930085282

Given nominal, inflation-linked, and variable annuities, as well as bonds and stocks, we search for optimal consumption and investment decisions under two different objective functions: (1) maximization of expected utility of real consumption, and (2) minimization of expected deviations from an inflation-adjusted target. When optimizing the objective, we allow for rebalancing the portfolio during retirement by buying additional annuities and by trading bonds and stocks. To find the optimal solution, we apply a multi-stage stochastic programming approach. Our findings indicate that independently of the considered objective function, real annuities are a crucial asset in every portfolio. In addition, without investing in real annuities, the retiree has to rebalance the portfolio more frequently, and still obtains a lower and more volatile real consumption. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CRRA utility; Inflation-linked annuity; Loss disutility; Multi-stage stochastic programming; Retirement planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938263654

They offer more options for their customers, like flexible delivery, pricing, etc. In this paper, we consider an inventory system where customers may have different priorities under the retailer's capacity. A single supplier who must invest in capacity to manufacturer and sell products to buyers having different priorities. The buyers can place pre-orders before their demand is observed, and can also issue additional orders upon observing demand information. Since the supplier guarantees delivery of pre-ordered goods (these are not constrained by the supplier's capacity), buyers with lower priorities may consider pre-ordering in order to secure inventory. We derive optimal policies for the supplier and buyers. We show surprisingly that it is optimal for the supplier to set the pre-order price so high that pre-ordering will not be used much even though pre-ordering should be of benefit to the supplier due to risk sharing. We also show that the supplier can make a pricing decision using an aggregate model. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Costs; Risk management; Aggregate model; Demand information; Flexible delivery; Inventory decisions; Inventory systems; Online retailing; Optimal policies; Pricing decision; Sales",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84948165913

We see the deployment of fictional literature in teaching as a way of consciously intervening in this biopolitical predicament. By urging students to work with fictional literature that has been part of their personal past, we encourage them to develop a ‘care of the self’. In the analysis, we first discuss the pedagogic process of the module, reflecting on our own presumptions and behaviours. Second, on the basis of students’ assignments, we analyse the outcome of their learning. In the concluding discussion, we argue that the fact that critical management education is already biopolitical does not preclude the possibility for it to renew educational practice. We suggest that as a result of the potential for creative self-formation offered by the use of literary fiction, transformation of both students and educators is possible. © The Author(s) 2013","Biopolitics; critical management education (CME); literary fiction; novels; reflexivity; ‘care of the self’",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931468309

More recently, CSR has increasingly attracted governments’ attention, and is now promoted in public policy, especially in the European Union (EU). Conflicts can arise, however, when advanced welfare states introduce CSR into public policy. The reason for such conflict is that CSR leaves key public welfare issues to the discretion of private business. This voluntary issue assignment contrasts starkly with advanced welfare states’ traditions favoring negotiated agreements and strong regulation to control corporate conduct. This article analyzes the conflicts and compatibilities arising when advanced welfare states introduce CSR, focusing on how the two traditions diverge and on how conflicts are reconciled. Empirically the study focuses on four Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden—widely recognized as the most advanced welfare states, and increasingly as leaders in CSR public policy. From interviews of 55 officials of government ministries, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and employer associations, the authors conclude that tension indeed exists between CSR public policies and advanced welfare state traditions in all four countries. Whereas CSR’s aims are compatible with Nordic institutional traditions, the means promoted in CSR is in conflict with such Nordic traditions as corporatist agreements and rights-based welfare state regulation of social and environmental issues. There is harmony of goals, but conflict in means between the four Nordic countries studied. © The Author(s) 2012.","business and political strategies; corporate social responsibility (CSR); politics; regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931461429

However, what exactly happens to marketing messages when they ‘go viral’ has not received much attention, and the intention of this article is to take a closer look at what happens to marketing messages when social media users comment on and co-create these messages. Drawing on one particular case, that is, the ‘do it for Denmark’ commercial, the article suggests that what happens is not simply that marketers’ original message spreads like a virus. Instead, a diverse set of discourses are constructed and shared as the marketing message goes viral. The contention of this article is that ‘uncontrollability’ of viral processes creates unforeseeable associations and meanings that may have little to do with the original message and meanings – in the present case changing meanings from ‘do it for Denmark’ to ‘do it to Denmark’. Therefore, tourism marketers need to better understand the complexity of viral processes and how co-creation of viral messages may fundamentally transform and transcend the original message. © The Author(s) 2015","Branding; co-creation; social media; viral marketing; viral processes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930901978

The link between demand for crops in one region and impacts in other regions is referred to here as indirect land use change (iLUC) and includes deforestation, intensification and reduced consumption. Existing models for iLUC tend to ignore intensification and reduced consumption, they most often operate with arbitrary amortisation periods to allocate deforestation emissions over time, and the causal link between land occupation and deforestation is generally weakly established. This paper presents the conceptual framework required for a consistent modelling of iLUC in Life Cycle Assessment. It reports on a novel and biophysical iLUC model, in which amortisation is avoided by using discounted Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). The causal link between demand for land and land use changes is established through markets for land's production capacity. The iLUC model presented is generally applicable to all land use types, crops and regions of the world in typical LCA decision-making contexts focusing on the long-term effects of small-scale changes. The model's strengths and weaknesses are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Attributional LCA; Consequential LCA; iLUC; Indirect land use changes; Intensification; Land use changes","Crops; Decision making; Deforestation; Depreciation; Global warming; Land use; Attributional LCA; Consequential LCA; iLUC; Indirect land-use changes; Intensification; Land-use change; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929269188

Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds on seven months of ethnographic fieldwork set in a Danish municipal unit which administered the sickness benefit legislation. Findings – Through the reading of an ethnographic example of implementation of labour market policy this paper suggests that when policy invariably is distorted at the administrative level it is not necessarily due to lack of will among street-level workers to comply with legislation or centrally devised directives but rather because: in practice, planning and implementation are concurrent processes that continuously feed into each other; and that the concerns and the “local knowledge and practice” that guide planning-implementation do not belong to individual people but are dynamic perspectives that individual people might take up in certain situations. Originality/value – This challenges conventional descriptions of street-level workers as a distinct group of people with distinctive concerns and attitudes to their work. The paper suggests instead the metaphor “vector of concern” to capture the way street-level workers’ changes of perspectives might cause interventions to disintegrate and evolve in potentially conflicting directions. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Danish bureaucracy; Ethnography; Labour market policy; Policy implementation; Street-level workers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958553873

Design/methodology/approach – The paper is based on an ethnographic study of frontline work at a citizen service centre in a Danish municipality, and draws on empirical material generated through observations, field notes, interviews and policy documents. Findings – The paper shows that e-government changes the mode of professionalism in citizen service from service to support. An ethnographic account of how digital reforms are implemented in practice shows how street-level bureaucrat’s classic tasks such as specialized casework are being reconfigured into educational tasks that promote the idea of “becoming digital”. In the paper, the author argues that the work of “becoming digital” in client processing entails two interconnected changes in frontline agents’ practice: de-specialization of the task and intensified informality in relation to citizens. As a result, the frontline agent works as an explorative generalist whose professional skills and personal competencies are blurred. Originality/value – The study contributes to ethnographic research in public administration by combining two separate subfields, e-government and street-level bureaucracy, to discern recent transformations in public service delivery. In the digital era, tasks, control and equality are distributed in ways that call for symmetrical and relational approaches to studying street-level bureaucracy. The argument goes beyond technological or social determinism to find a fruitful intermediary position pointing at technological change as having both constraining and enabling effects. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital era governance; E-government; Ethnography; Public administration; Public service delivery; Street-level bureaucracy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958542402

This is done by focusing on front line tax inspectors’ decisions about tax evasion. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents ethnography of bureaucracy and field audits. The material stems from fieldwork conducted in the Central Customs and Tax Administration. Findings – The paper shows that the tax inspectors reason about tax evasion in a casuistic manner. They pay attention to similar cases and to particular circumstances of the individual cases. In deciding on tax evasion, the inspectors do not just administer the laws; they also enact a policy of fair-mindedness. Doing this they are constrained by time and man-powers, but also enabled by various organizational devices. Research limitations/implications – The tax inspectors that the author followed were carefully chosen and acted in accordance with procedures. The ethnography should be understood in relation to this set-up. Originality/value – The originality of the paper is that it shows that ethnography can open the territory of everyday reasoning in public administration. Also, it shows the discretionary room that any front line tax inspector navigates in.

The governance scheme of the recently introduced TEN-T core network corridors seems to fulfil this requirement. Following a brief history of TEN-T development, the 2013 major overhaul of the EU transportation infrastructure policy is outlined and the basic differences with the past are pinpointed. The provisions of the new TEN-T Guidelines are scrutinized so as to check whether the TEN-T core network corridors exhibit the characteristics of a green corridor, as they have been identified in the previous chapter.

Air pollution from transportation and especially carbon dioxide emissions are at the center stage of discussion by the world community through various international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol. The transportation sector also emits non-CO2 pollutants that have important effects on air quality, climate, and public health. The main purpose of this chapter is to introduce some basic concepts that are relevant in the quest of green transportation logistics. First, we present the basics of estimating emissions from transportation activities, the current statistics and future trends, as well as the total impact of air emissions and its contribution to climate change. In addition, this chapter presents the basics of environmental policy measures. In that context, we describe a way to measure the cost-effectiveness of various measures through the so-called Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC).

This involves the selection of an appropriate speed by the vessel, so as to optimize a certain objective. As ship speed is not fixed, depressed shipping markets and/or high fuel prices induce slow steaming which is being practised in many sectors of the shipping industry. In recent years the environmental dimension of slow steaming has also become important, as ship emissions are directly proportional to fuel burned. Win-win solutions are sought, but they will not necessarily be possible.

Part of the book is drawn from the recently completed European Union project Super Green, a three-year project intended to promote the development of European freight corridors in an environmentally friendly manner. Additional chapters cover both the methodological base and the application context of green transportation logistics. Individual chapters look at the policy context; the basics of transportation emissions; Green Corridors basics; the concept of TEN-T (Trans-European Network); Benchmarking of green corridors; the potential role of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies); Green vehicle routing; Reducing maritime CO2emissions via market based measures and speed and route optimization; Sulphur emissions; Lifecycle emissions; Green rail transportation; Green air transportation; Green inland navigation and possible areas for further research. Throughout, the book pursues the goal of win-win solutions and analyzes the phenomenon of push-down, pop-up, wherein a change in one aspect of a problem can cause another troubling aspect to arise. For example, speed reduction in maritime transportation can reduce emissions and fuel costs, but could require additional ships and could raise in-transit inventory costs.

The basis of this material is work conducted in the context of the EU SuperGreen project, which aimed at advancing the green corridor concept through a benchmarking exercise involving Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The chapter discusses the available definitions of green corridors and identifies the characteristics that distinguish a green corridor from any other efficient surface transportation corridor. After providing examples of green corridor projects in Europe, it focuses on the KPIs that have been proposed by various projects for monitoring the performance of a freight corridor. Emphasis is given to the SuperGreen KPIs, covering the economic, technical, environmental, social and spatial planning aspects of freight logistics, as they have been scrutinized extensively by stakeholders in order to keep their number within practical and operable limits. In addition, the chapter presents the performance monitoring methodology that was developed by SuperGreen in an effort to close the gap of earlier works. The lessons learned from SuperGreen lead to a revised methodology suitable for monitoring the performance of a corridor. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

SOx emissions are non-GHG emissions that are caused by the presence of sulphur in the fuel. As the maximum percentage of sulphur in automotive and aviation fuels is strictly regulated in most countries around the world, much of the attention in recent years has focused on maritime transport. The attention mainly stems from the fact that in marine fuels the percentage of sulphur can be very high: it can be as high as 4.5 % in Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO), which is the fuel typically used in all deep-sea trades. Even though the amounts of SOx produced by ships are substantially lower than CO2, SOx emissions are highly undesirable as they cause acid rain and undesirable health effects in humans and animals. To mitigate these adverse environmental effects, the international shipping community has taken substantial policy measures. With the introduction of new limits for the content of sulphur in marine fuels in Northern European and North American sea areas, short-sea companies operating in these areas will face substantial additional cost. As of 1/1/2015, international regulations stipulate, among other things, a 0.1%limit in the sulphur content of marine fuels, or equivalent measures limiting the percent of SOx emissions to the same amount. As low-sulphur fuel is substantially more expensive than HFO, there is little or no room within these companies current margins to absorb such additional cost, and thus significant price increases must be expected. Unlike its deep-sea counterpart, in short-sea shipping such a freight rate increase may induce shippers to use landbased alternatives (mainly road). A reverse shift of cargo would go against the EU policy to shift traffic from land to sea to reduce congestion, and might ultimately (under certain circumstances) increase the overall level of CO2 emissions along the entire supply chain. The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the potential effect of sulphur regulations on the share of cargo transported by the waterborne mode vis-à-vis land-based alternatives. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

The purpose of this paper is to ensure asset safety and sustainability, public sector firms have to adopt new processes and practices. It is the role of supervisors to implement the changes, and as part of the new publicmanagement (NPM) public sector reforms, public sector asset managers have more discretionary power to implement further changes related to increased accountability. Design/methodology/approach–The paper explores the impact of management practices on supervisor-employee relationships and employees’ perception of autonomy, employees’ attitudes towards change and their perceptions of organisational culture within Australian public sector engineering asset management organisations, and in the context of NPM reforms and consequent changes in supervisory discretionary power. Social exchange theory provided the theoretical framework and a self-report survey was administered to 149 employees. Findings–The findings from a structural equationmodel indicate positive and significant relationships between the variables in this study. A finding of significant interest was that public sector employees are on average slightly dissatisfied with their supervisors and feel they have a minimal amount of autonomy in the workplace. This may represent an unintended consequence of NPM reforms. Research limitations/implications–The implication of the findings is that an effective relationship between supervisors and employees is a necessary ingredient for achieving change, and ensuring asset safety and sustainability. Social exchange theorists argue that the low level of satisfaction with the supervisors evident in this study is one factor compromising asset safety and sustainability. Originality/value–The roadblocks to good supervisory relationships in the post NPM environment must be dismantled and the findings clearly indicate a need for targeted development of supervisors/management skills to ameliorate the negative effects of the NPM regime and enable effective change management. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Attitude towards organizational change; Autonomy; LMX; PEAMOC; Physical asset management; Psychological well-being",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937921328

The core argument is that extreme work is informed by pervasive win-win fantasies which can be recognized in a number of current organizational trends, ranging from New Public Management, over corporate culture, to project work. Each of these trends claims to transcend paradoxes by making contradictory extremes enhance each other rather than hamper each other. This is partly made possible by an increasing immateriality of both money and labor, I argue. Drawing on empirical data from creative knowledge industries, this article illustrates how ‘win-win’ workers subscribe to a set of norms promising that extreme work is a ticket to Never-Never Land. These norms are progression, passion, indispensability, and individual agency. The empirical analysis shows that win-win fantasies imprison us in ‘irreflexive modernity’, unable to escape the dream. In the end, the article discusses avenues for finding our way back into reflexive modernity through moderation, prioritization, and paying critical attention to the deferral between gain and cost practiced in win-win games. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","creative industries; critique of capitalism; ethnography; extreme work; knowledge-intense companies; new public management; project work; win-win games; worker subjectivities; zero-sum game",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84936886889

Intermodal terminals have an important role in today’s globally complex supply networks. In the case of bottleneck-derived terminalization, operational issues such as achieving effective material flow remains a significant and common challenge. To assist with such challenges, the paper develops a conceptual framework built on the principles of lean. Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, a theory-building approach is adopted and a lean terminalization framework developed by combining aspects of lean- and intermodal transport theory with practical insights. The framework was developed in conjunction with two intermodal container facilities within the Scandinavian region. Findings – The conceptual framework demonstrates how lean approaches can be used to identify improvement areas, as well as to develop solutions for improved material flow in the context of intermodal transport operations. The framework can be used to guide the lean implementation process in small to medium intermodal container facilities. Research limitations/implications – The development of the framework represents the first stage of a two-stage project. The second stage will involve implementing and empirically testing the framework in the practical settings of the two-case facilities. Practical implications – Lean is a philosophical approach that consists of a set of principles that drive organizations to continually add value to their operations. The application of lean practices enhances necessary process steps and eliminates those that fail to add value, thereby improving material flow and performance. Social implications – Improving the operational efficiency and effectiveness of container terminals out not only assists the profitability of the facilities but also has flow-on benefits for stakeholders, external customers, consumers and the environment. Originality/value – Lean has been successfully applied in manufacturing because the 1990s, and though it has also found relevance in a number of other industries, applications of lean within the intermodal transport sector is limited. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Conceptual; Container facilities; Framework; Intermodal; Lean principles; Practical cases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019723659

Besides, reporting the main results of the project, the paper discusses some broader perspectives concerning social media in library context. Many public and academic libraries worldwide have, inspired by the American “23 Things” Web 2.0 training program, been involved in training and educating both of their internal staff and of their users. The key questions are: whether concepts like “23 Things” and the like are likely to contribute to solving the problems of the computer illiterate segments of the population and whether Web 2.0, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and the like represent subjects which should be legitimately taught as part of professional public and academic library activities. Design/methodology/approach – Based on systematic evaluation of public library-based social media courses, inspired by the “29 Things” concept, targeted at users. Findings – The article points out that it is questionable whether the “23 Things” project, as based on principles of self-directed learning, ownership for one's own learning and similar popular notions, which fit very well into the taste and preferences of computer literate middle-class individuals, will also work among computer illiterate citizens. Concerning the second key question, the article points out that only a few critical opinions are against social media in libraries and that the presence of social media is legitimized through different reasons, including marketing, learning and higher-order purposes.

In order to relate SMEs' offshoring initiatives with their operations configuration attributes, we draw on the operations networks literature and survey responses from 675 Danish and 410 Swedish companies. On the basis of the survey results, we find that although the SMEs are less experienced and less advanced in their offshoring ventures than large companies, they are building dispersed operations networks. Although still in their infancy, these networks are, as expected, creating new demands for their home bases in terms of demands for formalisation of work processes, systems development and managerial capability related to orchestrating operations across national borders, but more fundamentally, it also challenges the strategic foundations of the home base. Based on these observations, we discuss future global operations management challenges, practices and priorities of SMEs. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","offshoring; operations configuration; SMEs; survey","Computer applications; Industrial engineering; Operations research; Surveying; Formalisation; Global operations management; Large companies; Off-shoring; operations configuration; Small and medium enterprise; SMEs; Systems development; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937977779

In order to achieve these outputs, the PSFs need to ensure that their professionals are engaged and committed. Drawing on 375 surveys from the employees of a global PSF, we compare two models to test the relationship between work engagement and multi-foci commitment: the organization, the client, the team and the profession. We first explore an overall positive effect of work engagement on commitment to all four foci. We then compare the overall impact to the independent effects of work engagement dimensions on four commitment foci.

The policy incentives emphasize public procurement of innovation as a way to accelerate the development and application of environmental and health technologies, but also as a way to achieve a competitive advantage, growth and job creation. This paper uses a single case study to illustrate the procurement of a chemical-free cleaning system by the local government in Denmark. It describes the public procurement of innovation project in the response to an unsolicited bid from the supplier, and highlights the importance of innovation-friendly procurement practice for supporting innovation. The study identified indirect innovation effects of public procurement and number of conditions that have supported success of public procurement of innovation project such as close and early engagement with supplier; role of supplier acting as a technology champion; competence for applying functional specification; political support; sufficient resource allocation and institutional match between involved organizations. These findings lend support to the idea that public procurement of innovation may have occurred as a result of innovation-friendly procurement practice regardless of the lack of an explicit intention to promote innovation and challenge assumptions on which emerging policy initiatives are based on. These findings also suggest that the local government procurement may have a role to play in supporting innovation that goes beyond current definition of public procurement as a mission-oriented instrument to be exploited for resolving social challenges. These understandings could contribute to further policy development that may lead to a situation where public procurement of innovation is utilized to a greater extent than it is today in Denmark. © 2015 ICCR Foundation.","Innovation; public procurement; unsolicited bid","competitiveness; innovation; local government; policy approach; policy development; technology adoption; technology policy; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942795134

We argue that schools may be unable to match rising institutional pressures to publicly commit to responsible management education with their limited internal capacity for change. Our analysis proposes that decoupling is likely if schools (a) are exposed to resource stringency, (b) face overt or covert resistance against change processes, (c) are confronted with competing institutional pressures, and (d) perceive institutional demands as ambiguous. We discuss two implications of this proposition. On one hand, decoupling can cause dissonant legitimacy perceptions, leading to cynicism around responsible management education within business schools. On the other hand, a temporary inconsistency between talk and action may help schools to articulate future ambitions for responsible management education, which, over time, could inspire recoupling effects. © The Author(s) 2015.","corporate social responsibility; decoupling; Principles for Responsible Management Edcuation (PRME); responsible management education",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930152550

In two experimental studies with 927 respondents, significant interaction effects emerge between endorsement and similarity: celebrities increase consumer evaluations of brand extensions, more so for low similarity extensions than for high similarity extensions. Thus, celebrities can mitigate the negative impact of low similarity extensions. This effect stems from the reduction in perceived purchase risk. Finally, for a low similarity extension, celebrity endorsement is more effective for parent brands with small rather than large product portfolios. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Brand extensions; Brand management; Celebrity endorsement; Purchase risk; Similarity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026461337

The success of food innovations depends on understanding how consumers form and change attitudes toward food technologies. Earlier post hoc explanations suggest that evaluative conditioning can change consumer attitudes toward food technologies. The present study tests how evaluative conditioning can affect consumer acceptance of new food technologies. Furthermore, authors investigate whether evaluative conditioning is resistant to extinction after a two-month period and whether the evaluative conditioning effect prevails in a product-related context. Within an evaluative conditioning paradigm including between-subjects control groups in addition to standard within-subjects control conditions, participants were presented with three food technologies (conventional, enzyme, and genetic technology) paired with affectively positive, neutral, and negative pictures. Subsequent evaluative measurements revealed that evaluative conditioning can explain attitude change toward food technologies when affective pictures are used. Furthermore, results indicate that evaluative conditioning is resistant to extinction after two months and acquired evaluative conditioning effect spills over in a product-related context.

The outcome of the literature review is a conceptual typology that organizes and summarizes the body of knowledge on ICT and innovation in services, and reveals the critical knowledge gaps along with an agenda for future research. The main contribution of this work resides in having organized existing literature on the relationship between ICT and innovation in services into a conceptual typology. The conceptual typology outlines the three main aspects of the link between ICT and innovation in services: the integration of organizational and innovation processes; the cooperation among internal and external agents; and the self-reinforcing innovation mechanism that characterizes ICT as a product.

Despite this positive influence on educational outcomes, it is still unclear why some children are more prosocial than others in school. The current study investigates a possible link between following a prosocial norm and self-regulation. We tested 433 children between 6 and 13 years of age in two variations of the Dictator Game. Children were asked what they should or would give in the game and then played an actual DG. We show that most children hold a common norm for sharing resources, but that some children fail to follow that norm in the actual game. The gap between norm and behavior was correlated with self-regulation skills on a parent-report individual differences measure. Specifically, we show that two components of self-regulation, attention and inhibition, predict children's ability to follow the stated norm for giving. These results suggest that some children are poorer at holding the norm in mind and following through on enacting it. We discuss the implications of these results for education and programs that promote social and emotional learning (SEL). © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Children; Prosocial norms; Self-regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941315343

The discussion on the theory of foresight calls for a theory, but rarely expounds on what the scope of theorizing is. The discussion has been centered on philosophy and different frameworks for theorizing, but the scope and form of theorizing have not been explored. We contribute to this discussion by examining foresight through the lens of established theory building literature to map what constitutes a theory in the first place and how it applies in foresight. The main guiding question is ""What does a theory of foresight mean?"". We fist draw on the literature on theory development in social sciences to discuss a framework for theorizing and then examine the scope of theorizing through it. Our main argument is that when we propose developing (a) theory of foresight, we need to separate three levels of analysis: one is foresight as knowledge creating activity, second is foresight as a process and as a social/organizational intervention, and foresight as theorizing about the future of a given socio-technical system. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Epistemology; Foresight; Theorizing; Theory development","Innovation; Technological forecasting; Epistemology; Foresight; Levels of analysis; Sociotechnical systems; Theorizing; Theory building; Theory development; Through the lens; Algorithms; knowledge; philosophy; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940871893

Contrary to parts of the extant literature, we do not find that corporate sustainability directly adds measurable value (e.g. a better brand image); neither does it exert coercive control over critical supplier relationships. However, corporate sustainability minimizes the downside risk of the business model. It does so by (1) creating implicit contracts that reach beyond traditional 'shareholder value', (2) transferring risk to suppliers and (3) improving leadership by motivating management and employees, and by directing their attention to critical issues. For companies, we offer the insight that corporate sustainability is a necessary complement to shareholder value, even if the relationship is not obvious at first sight. We also suggest that concerted actions of companies or a positive connotation of certification create effective control over suppliers. As to public policy, we conclude that regulators could introduce mandatory disclosure of suppliers to facilitate controls through stakeholders, or alternatively an industry-wide comply-or-explain code of conduct. We also address how regulators can take direct actions against countries with unsustainable labor policies. Last, we suggest future research topics, e.g. expanding the notion of a business model by interpreting 'adding value' as prevention of losses. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.","Business model; Corporate social responsibility; Corporate sustainability; CSR policies; Environmental policy; Information disclosure; Labor practices; Public policy; Risk management; Shareholder value; Stakeholder engagement; Supply chain; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937024222

Managerial resources underlie export initiation in the theory of the multinational enterprise developed in international business studies, but they are largely ignored in empirical studies of international trade. This is probably not because they are unimportant, but more due to the challenges of identifying and measuring these resources. We exploit Danish employer-employee matched data to overcome this challenge and analyse the impact of managers' international experience, together with other managerial characteristics, on the likelihood that the firm starts exporting. We find that productivity and fixed costs associated with exporting are not the sole determinants of selection of firms into international markets, but that 'managerial inputs' are just as important.

This study shows the possibility and describes the main principles of adjacent coflow of slurries resulting in formation of thin plates of graded ceramic material. Results showed that the small variations of solvent and binder system concentrations have a substantial effect on slurry viscosity. Varying these parameters showed that side-by-side tape casting with a well-defined interface area is possible for slurries with viscosities above 3500 mPa s at a casting shear rate of 3.3 s-1. As it was expected, the choice of de-bindering and sintering regimes significantly influences crack formation, and a three-step heating programme was found to result in tapes of the highest quality. The interface regions of green graded tapes were investigated structurally by scanning electron microscopy; for a distinct identification of the interface region and analysing the degree of cross-interface diffusion, the isothermal entropy change was measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer as the magnetic transition temperature (Curie temperature) is very sensitive to the dopant level in ceramics.

The analysis builds on a panel data set covering municipal spending on services in all 98 Danish municipalities. The authors find that contracting out is shaped by ideology in social services but not in technical services, which indicates that social services are the contemporary ideological battlefield of privatization. The analysis further reveals that economically prosperous municipalities are more likely to contract out social services, whereas contracting out of technical services is not influenced by economic affluence. Finally, larger municipalities contract out more in technical services but less in social services, demonstrating that the size effect is contingent on the transaction cost characteristics of the service. © 2015 by The American Society for Public Administration.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932195744

As a result, this paper embraces embodied methodologies. It integrates audio-visual impressionistic tales and netnographic snippets to shape its multisensory exploration of an under-researched European tourism and train travel phenomenon, interrailing. Our analysis exemplifies how the rhythmscapes and soundscapes of everyday rail travel inform the experience of interrail. Finally, we introduce the concept of thermalscapes, giving attention to the relatively neglected role of temperatures in tourism experiences. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Audio-visual methods; Interrail; Non-representational; Rhythms; Sounds; Temperatures","mobility; research; temperature gradient; tourism; visual analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928895393

Literature on green supplier evaluation that considers environmental factors are relatively limited. Recently, in supply chain management decision making, approaches for evaluating green supplier performance have used both qualitative and quantitative environmental data. Given this evolving research field, the goal and purpose of this paper is to analyze research in international scientific journals and international conference proceedings that focus on green supplier selection. We propose the following questions that will be answered: (i) which selection approaches are commonly applied?, (ii) what environmental and other selection criteria for green supplier management are popular?, (iii) and what limitations exist? Published research from 1997 to 2011 is structurally reviewed based on the first two questions. We find that the applied techniques are mostly fuzzy based single model approaches. The most common criterion considered for green supplier selection was ""environmental management systems"". A further critical analysis is completed and gaps in the current literature are identified. These gaps help us to identify improvements for green supplier selection process and possible future directions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Green criteria; Green supplier evaluation; Multi criteria decision; Performance evaluation; Supply chain management; Systematic literature review","Environmental management systems; Supply chain management; Green criteria; Green supplier; Multicriteria decision; Performance evaluation; Systematic literature review; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926228385

The paper has two components - an introductory conceptual part and an empirical part that should be considered as basis for the preliminary validation of the conceptual insights. The research sample includes six firms - three from Canada and three from Denmark. Two different early internationalisation paths have been identified: Lean-to-global (L2G start-ups) and lean-and-global (L&G start-ups). Both types of start-ups were found to have faced significant problems with the complexity, uncertainties and risks of being innovative on a global scale. They have however found ways of addressing these problems by a disciplined knowledge sharing and IP protection strategy and the efficient use of business and supporting and public funding mechanisms. The Danish firms have pivoted around the ways of delivering their value proposition and not around the specific value propositions themselves. The Canadian firms have actively pivoted their value proposition motivated by the degree of innovativeness of their products and the insights from business supporting organisations. The analysis of the results justifies the introduction of the LGS concept and opens the opportunity for future research focusing on the articulation of more practical LGS entrepreneurial frameworks. © 2015 Imperial College Press.","born global firm; business model; innovation management; international new venture; Lean global start-up; lean start-up; technology entrepreneurship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930090875

The model takes central factors into account, which have previously been identified as obstacles to the successful development of leadership qualifications. The paper presents the theoretical background for the model and makes suggestions for its implementation in a teaching and learning programme. The model integrates overall elements related to human biology and transfer of learning into a holistic learning process, which more specifically emphasizes the transformational leadership elements of envisioning, translating, communicating and sustaining credibility during change. Design/methodology/approach - The teaching and learning programme is based on a comprehensive leadership learning model, which integrates different levels of knowledge, learning processes and learning formats. Findings - In the area of leadership development, the paper presents its teaching and learning programme as a way for managers to obtain leadership meta-skills, which can be applied and individually adapted to the changing demands and conditions of modern work life.

Based on a critical review of the meaning of development and an interrogation of various developmental discourses, the authors develop a conceptual framework that brings together issues of development, well-being, and social inequalities. We suggest that these issues are better understood and addressed when examined via grounded investigations of the role of markets in shaping the management of resources, consumer agency, power inequalities and ethics. The use of markets as units of analysis may lead to further cross-fertilizations of TCR and macromarketing and to more comprehensive theorizing and transformational impact.

Findings - Overall, it was found that innovation attributes have an effect on brand equity, and this effect differs between low- and high-equity brands, with a low-equity brand being benefited more than a high-equity brand from perceptions towards a product’s innovation attributes. Additionally, it was found that the impact of complexity and relative advantage on brand equity increases when consumer innovativeness increases in the case of a high-equity brand. However, no significant difference was found between low- and high-equity brands regarding the proposed moderating effect of innovativeness. Research limitations/implications - The study only examines two brands belonging to one particular industry, which limits the findings’ generalizability. Thus, the use of more test brands from different industries should be the goal for future research. Practical implications - Managers should consider the firm’s current brand equity level and its competitive position to maximize the effect of product innovation attributes. Originality/value - The study makes an original contribution to the research on the relationship between product innovation and brand equity and provides theoretical and managerial implications in the field of innovation and brand management © Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Brand equity; Consumer innovativeness; Innovation attributes; Product innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84934762665

Enterprises that are not sufficiently financially successful perish. The purpose of this paper is to present a model and methodology referred to as sustainable enterprise excellence, resilience and robustness (SEER2) that provides enterprises with a means of balancing financial, social, and environmental considerations. These considerations form the classic elements of the triple bottom line and are central formation of enterprise responses to climate change and social strain. Design/methodology/approach - A model referred to as the Springboard to SEER2 is introduced. SEER2 explicitly considers societal and environmental performance and impacts that are driven by strategy and implemented through processes. As such criteria associated with the Springboard that address strategy, processes, performance, and impact are also introduced. Findings - Humanity is at individual, enterprise, and societal levels partially or wholly responsible for many critical and time-sensitive social and environmental challenges. Due to their vast collective resource consumption and resource base, enterprises should also contribute to solving such challenges. The presented Springboard to SEER2 model and associated criteria provide a rigorous, yet defined path for enterprises that have the determination to confront such challenges.

Academic excellence is conceptualized as successfully gaining funds for inter-organizational research collaborations, interdisciplinary graduate schools and high-ranked scientific reputation. Design/methodology/approach – The study applies upper echelon theory to universities. Three hypotheses are developed: (overall) top management team heterogeneity is positively associated with successful funding of excellence clusters, (overall) top management team heterogeneity is positively associated with successful funding of graduate schools and (overall) top management team heterogeneity is positively associated with academic reputation. The empirical study is based on a cross-sectional dataset with a time lag, covering characteristics of 75 German public universities from 2008 to 2013. Multiple-regression analysis is applied to test the hypotheses. Findings – Our results indicate that disciplinary and educational diversity of upper echelons has a positive effect on the outcomes. Other top management team characteristics (age, gender, etc.) show no significant effects. Besides top management team composition, we find that a high number of faculties and a broad inclusion of internal status groups (students, tenured faculty, academic and administrative staff) and external stakeholders in decision making processes may enhance academic excellence of universities. Research limitations/implications – First, the study contributes to the body of literature concerned with higher education. It is situated at the crossroads of management studies and higher education research, unlocking strategic management theorizing for the public context. Furthermore, the study contributes to the body of literature on strategic leadership in pluralistic organizations. It highlights the importance of heterogeneous governance structures and modular organization designs for achieving academic excellence. Practical implications – The paper may inform practitioners in administrative or leading positions and policy-makers concerned with higher education. The more diverse a top management team is in terms of multiple disciplinary backgrounds, the more likely they succeed in driving the university toward academic excellence.

The authors illustrate this by telling the Pilgrim business story. It is common for the deeds of men who founded businesses to be narrated as heroic entrepreneur stories. Such fairy tales are dominant narratives in Western culture but do not resonate with everyone, particularly women. Consequentially, many businesswomen do not engage in the rhetoric of enterprise. Design/methodology/approach – The qualitative, analytic approaches adopted in this study include narratology, semiotics and aesthetics. This complementary triage helps us appreciate the complexity of entrepreneur stories while unravelling the nuances of the tale. It also permits triangulation of the data gathered from an in-depth interview of the respondent with newspaper and Internet research. Findings – The research indicates that “fellowship-tales” provide a viable and credible alternative to the fairy-tale rendition common in entrepreneur and business stories. Research limitations/implications – An obvious limitation is that one merely swaps one narrative framework for another, albeit it offers dissenting voices a real choice. Practical implications – This study has the potential to be far reaching because at a practical level, it allows disengaged entrepreneurs and significant others the freedom to exercise their individual and collective voices within a framework of nested stories. Originality/value – A key contribution is to challenge the hegemony of a dominant and embedded social construct allowing new understandings to emerge via a novel combination of research methodologies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Aesthetics; Entrepreneurial narrative; Fairy tale; Fellowship-tales; Semiotics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930153858

It applies a critical and comparative approach, integrating both local perspectives and adaptation research from Canada and Greenland to make the case for recasting the way the Arctic and Inuit are approached conceptually and politically. The emphasis on indigenous peoples as future-makers and right-holders paves the way for a new understanding of the concept of indigenous knowledge and a more sensitive appreciation of predicaments and dynamics in the Arctic.

In an era of 'West-meets-East', balancing formality and informality is becoming critical for firms, especially those facing institutional differences in transnational contexts and institutional transitions. In this research, we conducted a comparative multicase study on returnee entrepreneurs and local entrepreneurs in China. We found that at the early stage of venturing, returnee entrepreneurs emphasized formality more than informality, while local entrepreneurs stressed informality more than formality. However, the formality-informality balance among both returnee and local entrepreneurs converged over time in line with the institutional transition in China. Returnee entrepreneurs increased the emphasis on informality (but kept the dominant position of formality), whereas local entrepreneurs gradually shifted from informality to formality. The spatial pattern of asymmetrical balancing and the temporal pattern of transitional balancing are both rooted in the Chinese philosophy of Yin-Yang balancing. © 2015 The International Association for Chinese Management Research.","Formality-informality balance; Institutional differences and institutional dynamics; Returnee and local entrepreneurship; Yin-Yang duality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84905843218

Here, event risk is used as a generic term for life insurance events, such as death, disability, etc. In our treatment of participating life insurance, we have special focus on the bonus schemes “consolidation” and “additional benefits”, and one goal is to formalize how these work and interact. Another goal is to describe similarities and differences between participating life insurance and unit-linked insurance. By use of a two-account model, we are able to illustrate general concepts without making the model too abstract. To allow for complicated financial markets without dramatically increasing the mathematical complexity, we focus on economic scenarios. We illustrate the use of our model by conducting scenario analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation, but the model applies to scenarios in general and to worst-case and best-estimate scenarios in particular. In addition to easy computations, our model offers a common framework for the valuation of life insurance payments across product types. This enables comparison of participating life insurance products and unit-linked insurance products, thus building a bridge between the two different ways of formalizing life insurance products. Finally, our model distinguishes itself from the existing literature by taking into account the Markov model for the state of the policyholder and, hereby, facilitating event risk. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bonus; Economic scenarios; Fairness; Guarantees; Market valuation; Participating life insurance; Stochastic differential equations; Two-account model; Unit-linked insurance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994862584

The dominant discourse in public relations is that using social media is ""good"", because social media can help organizations in developing dialogs and relationships with publics and in engaging with them. Yet empirical evidence in public relations is mostly case-dependent and limited to the realm of understanding current organizational practices, with limited understanding of the concrete value for organizations or for publics. In this paper I question the utility of social media for publics, organizations and public relations, and I argue that the positive view of social media held by the majority of public relations scholars is grounded on the profession's need to reconcile the two sides of public relations identity-the rhetorical and the relational. A discussion of whether current public relations practices in social media reflect these two main identities is offered, as well as a discussion of the implications of uncritical use of social media for the public relations profession. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Critique; Identity; Interpersonal relations; Public relations; Rhetoric; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947302545

While much is known about different social, cognitive, and technical factors that influence initial adoption and use, less is known about the role of emotional factors in users' behaviors. Through an in-depth field study conducted in two North American universities, we examine the role of emotions in how specific IT use patterns emerge. We find that there are five different characteristics of an IT stimulus event (cues) that, when interacting in a reinforcing manner, elicit a single class of emotions (uniform affective responses) and, when interacting in an oppositional manner, elicit mixed emotions (ambivalent affective responses). While users respond to uniform emotions with clear adaptation strategies, they deal with ambivalent emotions by combining different adaptation behaviors, a vacillating strategy between emphasizing positive and negative aspects of the stimulus. Surprisingly, these ambivalent emotions and vacillating strategies can lead to active and positive user engagement, exhibited in task and tool adaptation behaviors and improvisational use patterns that, despite their nonconformity to terms of use, can have positive organizational implications. © 2015 The Authors.","Adaptation behaviors; Ambivalence; Emotions; IT use patterns; Qualitative research","Management information systems; Adaptation behaviors; Ambivalence; Emotions; IT use patterns; Qualitative research; Behavioral research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945276863

We follow over 157,000 individuals who leave paid employment and become business owners during the period 1992–2007. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we analyze both entry and exit, identifying and characterizing different profiles of individuals leaving paid employment to become business owners, and distinguishing exits by dissolution from exits by ownership transfer. Second, we provide new evidence on how particular experiences in the labor market and entry modes shape the post-entry dynamics of nascent business owners. By differentiating between different entry and exit routes, this paper provides new evidence on different human capital patterns among nascent business owners and on key determinants of entrepreneurial survival. Our results suggest that different exit modes can be predicted by business owners’ entry route. Furthermore, different exit modes exhibit different duration dependence patterns according to the entry mode. Additionally, the paper shows that businesses started after a displacement episode are not necessarily less successful. Those individuals entering entrepreneurship after being displaced due to previous employer closure are found to persist longer. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Business ownership; Entrepreneurship; Entry; Exit",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939985584

We decompose the productivity levels into technical efficiency, scale efficiency and country specific possibility sets (technical frontiers). Data have been collected on operating costs and patient discharges in each diagnosis related group for all hospitals in the four major Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. We find that there are small differences in scale and technical efficiency between countries, but large differences in production possibilities (frontier position). The country-specific Finnish frontier is the main source of the Finnish productivity advantage. There is no statistically significant association between efficiency and status as a university or capital city hospital.

The observed behavior is generally consistent with moderate risk aversion and a median (mean) RRA close to one (three). Values are validated for chief executive officers (CEOs) by testing theory-based predictions on the influence of individual characteristics on risk preferences such as gender, marital status, religiosity, and intelligence. Senior managers such as CEOs, presidents, and chairpersons of the boards of directors are significantly less risk averse than non-senior executives.

The impact of such programs, however, depends on who enrolls since initial competence and growth-intention levels vary significantly. Potential participants may suffer from limited ability to transform new knowledge into practice, absence of growth intention and too high or too low a prior competence level to be able to benefit substantially. Selection and self-selection processes therefore have a bearing on the extent to which such programs result in additionality, i.e. improved growth performance compared to non-intervention. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – Selection and self-selection processes are explored through a study of a large-scale training program for growth-oriented managers of small Danish firms. This program has, from 2012 to 2015, trained about 700 SME managers. Data are currently available for 366 of these participants. This evidence is compared with survey results from a randomly selected control group of 292 growth-oriented SME managers in the same firm-size group. The data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Findings – A number of selection and self-selection biases were identified in the analysis. While some of the identified biases did not seem to conflict with the ambitions of this growth program, others potentially have consequences for the additionality of the program. Originality/value – The paper is the first systematic study of the importance of who enrolls in training programs for SME managers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial education; Growth; Human capital; Learning; Policy; Small- to medium-sized enterprises",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929846907

However, very little research distinguishes between how the context may affect different engagement dimensions differently. Based on a theory of resource exhaustion, the purpose of this paper is to focus on a cognitively demanding work context in order to explore variations in effect of different engagement dimension and different expatriate work outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use survey results from 102 expatriate academics in Singapore to study the relations between job engagement and expatriate work outcomes. Contrary to most studies, the authors examine physical, emotional, and cognitive engagement separately. Findings - The authors found that for expatriate academics, the different dimensions of job engagement have different relationships with work outcomes such that physical engagement and emotional engagement are positively associated with various work outcomes while cognitive engagement is negatively related or not associated at allwith the same work outcomes. The authors explain the variation in results by drawing on recent developments in social cognitive neuroscience. Originality/value - This is one of the first empirical studies to examine job engagement in an international setting and the application of a social cognitive neuroscience provides a novel perspective.

In terms of the identification and use of organisational-wide maintenance management models the picture is not clears from both a literature and practical perspective. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the various models and their use in real-world applications, and in doing so, explores the gap between academic research and practice. Design/methodology/approach – For this paper two comprehensive reviews of the literature were undertaken, first, to identify and categorise the various maintenance management models, and second, to determine the depth of empirical evidence for the popular models in real-world applications. Descriptive analysis of both the practical examples and empirical evidence rates (EER) for maintenance related journals is provided. Findings – Within the literature 37 maintenance management models were identified and categorised. From these, three models were found to be popular: total productive maintenance (TPM), condition based maintenance, and reliability centred maintenance. While several thousand papers discussed these three models, only 82 articles were found to provide empirical evidence. Research limitations/implications – While providing a sound foundation for future research the outcomes are based solely on academic literature. Analysis of EER outside the field of maintenance is needed to make comparisons. Practical implications – The paper offers practitioners a detailed contemporary overview of maintenance management models along with tabulated results of practical examples to present day organisations. Such practical-focused papers are very limited within academic literature. Social implications – With EER as low as 1.5 per cent for some journals this paper acts as a reminder to researchers that they have an obligation to society to spend taxpayer funded research on addressing social needs and real-world problems. Originality/value – This paper makes a concerted attempt to link academic research with management and operational practitioners.While the paper is critical of the current academic imbalance between theory and practice, a number of suggestions to improve EER are offered in the conclusions. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empirical evidence; Literature review; Maintenance; Management models",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929662109

Design/methodology/approach - Actual adoption rates of 13 information content categories are computed using content analysis of annual reports for 62 listed companies. Each content category is seen as an innovation the company decides to adopt or not. Interviews with management in several companies illustrate the decision process of disclosure, and help predict adoption rates. Predicted and actual adoption rates are compared. Findings - Adoption rates vary considerably among the 13 types of content. The absolute level of adoption rates is affected by company size and environmental risk. However, those content categories that have either relatively high or low adoption rates are consistent among the subsamples, regardless of these corporate characteristics. This consistent variation in adoption rates seems to be predicted well by innovation adoption theory and its focus on the five attributes of the information itself: compatibility, trialability, complexity, observability and relative advantage. Research limitations/implications - The theoretical framework allows for different or changing internal and general contexts, and should be applicable to other settings, even though the particular predictions for adoption rates in this paper may not be applied as such. Originality/value - The level of analysis is changed from company level, which dominates previous research, to information content (individual content categories). Perceived attributes of the information content itself and innovation adoption theory are used for the first time to explain reason for the reporting practice, and are considered fruitful tools to predict consistent variations in adoption rates among different types of content.

However, the majority of studies have focused on the factors leading to academic entrepreneurship, while only few study the performance of these ventures. Moreover, this strand of the literature has focused solely on start-ups by university faculty. This study adds to these by including university graduates in the definition of academic entrepreneurs and controlling for the industry environment in which the new venture is founded; both aspects, which are recommended in recent studies. Longitudinal register data combined with responses from 1,151 first-time entrepreneurs in 2004 are used to explore the self-selection of individuals into certain industry environments and their subsequent performance—survival and growth—in the chosen environment. This study works from the hypothesis that university education (technical and non-technical) and industry experience increase new venture performance in high-profit and high-uncertainty industries, respectively, because of increased knowledge and skills; in addition, education and experience engender higher absorptive capacities and adaptability. The analysis controls for personal traits, social capital, and financial capital. Technical academics are found to perform better in both profitable and uncertain industries, whereas non-technical academics perform better only in profitable industries. Nevertheless, both types of academics are more likely to enter uncertain industries. The absorptive capacities of technical academics make these individuals particularly important in technology transfers to new ventures in unstable environments, which are important in developed economies. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Entrepreneurship; Firm performance; Human capital; Industry environment","Profitability; Technology transfer; Academic entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship; Firm Performance; Human capitals; Industry environment; Knowledge spillovers; New venture performance; University education; Education",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929061125

The literature on goal setting for innovation is inconclusive; some scholars claim that goals should be ambiguous in order to inspire novel ideas, but others claim that clear project goals are important in order to undertake innovation projects in an efficient manner. We aim to explain this inconsistency by taking a more fine-grained view of innovation where we study goal setting in relation to exploratory aspects such as idea generation separately from exploitatory aspects such as idea implementation. The results from an empirical survey study in the R&D department of an automotive company reveal that a general ambition to be innovative is positively related to all phases of innovation, but the effects of clear project goals are more complex. We found that idea novelty increases under conditions of either high or low levels of goal clarity, whereas mid-range levels of goal clarity are related to fewer novel ideas. These findings inform existing knowledge about goal setting and innovation, and in particular challenge the body of literature showing that only high levels of ambiguity in goal setting are a fruitful means for innovation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928999345

This policy aims to gradually achieve technology excellence and reduce China's reliance on foreign key technologies. But, it is still unclear how international technology in-licensing by Chinese firms, compared with domestic technology in-licensing, has contributed to the indigenous innovation of Chinese firms during the last decade, and whether indigenous innovation policy will continue to make sense in the next decade. This study uses a unique dataset containing information on 178 Chinese firms that were active in technology in-licensing during 2000-2004 - and their patenting activities up to 2009 - to investigate this question. Our findings suggest that, given the importance of R&D, Chinese firms that in-licensed international technologies have performed better with regard to indigenous innovation than those that mainly in-licensed domestic technologies, even though the national innovation policy suggests otherwise. The strategic implications based on the findings for Chinese firms, foreign firms, and policy makers are discussed in detail. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Finance; Domestic technology; Innovation policies; International technology; National innovation policy; Patenting activities; Relative contribution; Research and development; Technology in-licensing; Enterprise resource planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928588196

Meyers Vænge 15, Copenhagen, SV, DK-2450, Denmark; Jørgensen, S.E., University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 2, Copenhagen Ø, DK-2100, Denmark","Abstract The Danish island Samsø has since 1997 initiated a process through which the island should reach a state where it would be able to supply its own energy. Such a situation was reached since 2005 - after having established 21 windmills - and the island is now a net exporter of electricity to the Danish power network. At the same time the buildings in the more habituated areas were connected to 4 district heating plants which generate heat from combustion of straw in some cases combined with supplementary inputs from photo thermal devices. Meanwhile, certain activities on the island, such as running the ferries, cars, factories and heating in more distant areas are still dependent on significant input of fossil fuels. The inhabitants have recently stated a wish to move on towards being independent of fossil fuels in 2030 and carbon neutral during the next decades. As a consequence the idea came up to develop a method for the ""sustainability analysis"" of a society which would assist in governing the transitional process in the direction of increasing sustainability. Therefore, a framework has been developed based on the concept exergy that may reveal where large consumptions are taking places. Such areas are likely to be sensible targets for action or at least increased attention. Basic methods have been developed that allows to account for infrastructure, transfers, inputs and outputs, and consumption in terms of exergy, and taking into account whether the exergy storages or flows can be considered to be renewable or not. The framework has been developed for six societal sectors: the energy sector, the public sector, the private households, the agricultural sector, the industry, commerce and trade sector and nature. Nature is here considered an activity that provides the society with an exergy that may also be of value to our societies, often referred to as ecosystem services. Based on the estimated amount of infrastructure and transfers, inputs and outputs a number of ""sustainability indicators"" have been developed that may be monitored over time and which may serve to indicate whether potential measures undertaken also lead the society in the right direction. An attempt to evaluate the potential importance of wastes has also been carried out as in organic waste could play an important role in acquiring the amount of bio-diesel required to run the ferries in the future. The results demonstrate that the already existing overhead in production of electricity leaves the island with many options and a great opportunity to be independent of fossil fuels in near future. In fact, it might well be that socio-economical perspectives will turn out to be the more severe obstacles in the transition process. Adjacent to this work a carbon model has also been set up to reveal the consequence of proposed measures and strategies to the carbon budget of the island (Jørgensen and Nielsen, 2014). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

All industries, small or large, seek improvements in the purchasing of raw materials, manufacturing, allocation, transportation efficiency, in curbing storage time, importing and disposing of products, with a view towards achieving environment objectives and reducing costs in the manufacturing process. Hence, GSCM has an impact both from an academic scholarly perspective, as well as from the view of industrial managers, because organizations benefit when they are socially responsible in addition to being efficiently managed. A significant way to implement responsible GSCM is to reconsider, in innovative ways, the purchase and supply cycle, and a preliminary step would be to ensure that the supplier of goods successfully incorporates green criteria. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach called Fuzzy Axiomatic Design (FAD) to select the best green supplier for Singapore-based plastic manufacturing company. At first, the environmental criteria was developed along with the traditional criteria based on the literature review and company requirements. Next, the FAD methodology evaluates the requirements of both the manufacturer (design needs) and the supplier (functional needs), and because multiple criteria must be considered, a multi-objective optimization model of a fuzzy nature must be developed. The application of the proposed approach in the case company has been illustrated and the result of this study helps firm to establish the systematic approach to select the best green supplier within the set of criteria. When the proposed methodology is applied, it allows not only to select the most appropriate green supplier but also helps to analyse most appropriate alternative supplier which shows the great difference when compared to the other approaches. Finally, the managerial implication, conclusions of the study is discussed. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent years have seen manufacturing processes understand the green issues due to the social and environmental concerns involved. The drivers of green manufacturing, however, have not been thoroughly investigated. Thus, this paper investigates the responsibility of identifying twelve common drivers of green manufacturing from the combined assistance of existing literature, industrial managers, and expert opinion in the relevant field. A questionnaire on these common drivers was circulated among 120 leading firms in south India, and aided by their replies; a pair-wise comparison was made among the drivers. The pair-wise comparison is used as an input data and the drivers were analyzed on its basis. The analysis resorted to the use of a fuzzy Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach. The obtained results are validated by a two-stage sensitivity analysis, namely: (1) using different de-fuzzification methods that are further evaluated through the Spearman coefficient and (2) assigning varying weight to the essential top priority drivers of green manufacturing among all common drivers. This study helps firms to stimulate an essential driver for quick and better adoption of green manufacturing. Finally, the paper concludes with some insight into the future path of green manufacturing in developing countries and an acknowledgment of the study's own limitations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we focus on a recently proposed probabilistic collaborative filtering model that explicitly represents all users and items simultaneously in the model. This model class has several desirable properties, including high recommendation accuracy and principled support for group recommendations. Unfortunately, it also suffers from poor scalability. We address this issue by proposing a scalable variational Bayes learning and inference algorithm for these types of models. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly better accuracy results than other straw-men models evaluated on a collection of well-known data sets. We also demonstrate that the algorithm has a highly favorable behavior in relation to cold-start situations. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the European Union decided to prevent auditors from offering a significant extent of non-audit services to audit clients. Prior research has revealed that different advisory services have different effects on perceived auditor independence. This could be caused by differences in number and intensity of independence threats (self-interest, familiarity, self-review, advocacy). Therefore, this experimental study investigates the effect of such threats on independence perceptions in the case of German individual investors. Multivariate analyses indicate that a high self-interest and a high-familiarity threat may impair auditor independence in appearance. On the other hand, our findings do not reveal a significant effect of an existing advocacy threat on investors' trust in auditor independence. A negative effect of a self-review threat is not directly confirmed. However, the provision of services with regard to internal controls, and thus the self-review threat, interacts with the self-interest threat. They potentially impact perceived auditor independence negatively when non-audit fees are high. In contrast, no significant interactions with familiarity are found. Based on these findings, a general prohibition of non-audit services does not seem to be necessary. On the other hand, a non-audit fees cap might be reasonable. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926351718

However, the increasing global demand for agricultural and forestry commodities creates conflict and tradeoffs between dedicating land for conservation versus food production. Efforts to set aside new lands for biodiversity conservation are compromised by the globally rising demand, creating trade-offs between lands dedicated to conservation versus food production. Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans obtain from ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that protected areas provide social and economic benefits that can be used to build political support and raise funds for conservation. We analyzed the capability of current protected area networks in the semi-arid region of Spain to provide intermediate regulating services (habitat preservation for threatened species, climate regulation, erosion control and water flow maintenance) to support the final provisioning service of cultivated crops to support local communities. We found that existing networks of protected lands supply considerable quantities of ecosystem services, in particular carbon stocks and groundwater recharge. Our results demonstrate that the integration of systematic analyses of ecosystem services gaps in protected area planning could contribute substantially to safeguarding ecosystem services and biodiversity jointly. However, our study also reveals substantial differences in intermediate ecosystem services supplied by different of protected areas networks, with category VI areas (Natura-2000 sites) generally showing the highest potential for ecosystem services supply. This demonstrates the important role of Natura-2000 sites for preserving regulating services in the European semi-arid region. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Biodiversity; EU Biodiversity Strategy; Final ecosystem service; Intermediate ecosystem service; Natura 2000 network; RENPA network","biodiversity; conservation management; conservation planning; ecosystem service; European Union; protected area; semiarid region; spatial analysis; strategic approach; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924595907

Constraints involved lack of openness, too malleable artefacts, no common ground and radical change of the development trajectory. The engineers' learning depends on these constraints and enablers.

We find that museums and audiences alike largely co-construct one another along familiar lines of institutional authority and that more dialogic modes of interaction mainly result when museums harness audience knowledge resources.

For example, the Statistics on People Receiving Public Benefits have been joined into an integrated statistical system. In this way, the quality of the statistics has been enhanced and the published figures have become logically consistent. However, the statistical users request a more cohesive statistical system covering the entire population's attachment to the labour market. The system should include volume information and provide the possibility of analyzing longitudinal labour market data. Against this background, in the beginning of 2012 Statistics Denmark initiated work on developing an integrated statistical system for analyzing the entire population's attachment to the labour market. The statistical system is called Labour Market Account (LMA). It is intended to publish statistics from the LMA in 2014. In addition to being an important source of the future labour market statistics, the LMA will also be a direct or indirect input source to a number of other statistics within social, business and economic statistics. This presentation gives a description of the new statistical system and of the user requirements with regard to the system. Data from the various source registers frequently contain non-permissible overlaps or inconsistent start and end dates concerning the individual states. Subsequently, the presentation describes the core of the new statistical system which is the harmonization of data from a great variety of input sources and the longitudinal data processing conducted by the rule driven engine developed for this purpose.

In April 2015 Statistics Denmark has published figures of the populations attachment to the labour market measured in full-time equivalents and as labour market status based on the new Labour Market Accounts (LMA). Longitudinal micro data for researcher will be available soon. The Working Time Account which provide data to the National Account will be revised in 2016 to use data from the Labour Market Account. The interest from users on the new possibilities is big. © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.","data harmonization; data linkage; Integrated statistics; micro data",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930240733

It proposes a relative quantitative measure, overall criticality (OC), for prioritisation of items based on penalty incurred due to their non-availability. In complex projects, practicing managers find it difficult to measure OC of items because of the subjective factors and intractable nature of penalties involved. However, using their experience, they can linguistically identify the antecedents and relate them to consequent OC. This work adopts Fuzzy Set Theory to capture managerial tacit knowledge which provides them enough flexibility to provide information in real form. Computed OC values can be used for items prioritisation and as shortage cost coefficient in inventory models. The revised materials management policy was applied to a shipbuilding project. OC values were analysed to justify the importance of incorporating project network characteristics and potential cost savings were calculated. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","complex projects; Fuzzy Set Theory; If-Then rules; linguistic 2-tuple; materials management; overall criticality","Complex networks; Computational linguistics; Criticality (nuclear fission); Fuzzy sets; Industrial management; Inventory control; Linguistics; Managers; Materials handling; Set theory; Shipbuilding materials; 2-Tuple; Complex projects; If-then rules; Inventory models; Materials management; Quantitative measures; Set-theoretic approach; Shipbuilding project; Fuzzy set theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027927664

In order to bridge different thought worlds and cross-organisational barriers, managers must initiate and motivate boundary spanning processes. The purpose of this paper is to explore how boundary spanners manage creativity projects across organisational boundaries. Design/methodology/approach – The authors link to previous literature and present findings from a comparative case study of managerial practices for managing creativity projects. Data were collected through interviews, secondary materials, site visits and observation. Findings – Three meta-practices used by managers to manage boundary-spanning creative projects are presented: defining the creative space, making space for creativity and acting in the creative space. These practices are detailed in seven case studies of creative projects. Research limitations/implications – The analysis focuses on boundary spanning as a management process rather than a capability for organisations to self-organise. It extends the “boundary spanning as practice” literature by focusing on boundary spanning as a managerial practice and brings the problems related to resource mobilisation across both organisational and departmental boundaries to the fore. Practical implications – Understanding the managerial dilemma faced by creativity managers is a first step to finding solutions. The discussed practices may inspire managers both in resolving creativity management problems and through self-reflection. Originality/value – The authors contribute to research on boundary spanning practices by linking to creativity research, and bridge to research on management and governance in distributed and lessdefined organisations. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business-to-business marketing; Case studies; Knowledge creation; Lateral thinking; Learning organizations; Management techniques",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929851765

It is part of a larger problem faced by not only business, but every sort of organization - how to live with the epidemic of standards and norms, often in conflict, many just unnecessary, and a few that are quite helpful and important. There are good reasons to have International Standards Organization (ISO), International Labor Organization (ILO), World Trade Organization (WTO), North Atlantic Treaty Association (NAFTA), International accounting Standards Boards (IASB), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)), and many more standard-setting organizations issuing, auditing, proposing codes of ethics, and certifying standards and norms.

This article addresses this literature gap by examining the employee relations in companies highly affected, less affected and not affected by the crisis. It argues that although Danish shop stewards are involved in developing local responses to the crisis, most manage to keep their colleagues onboard, even if decisions concern reduced earnings and dismissals. However, a limit exists to the collaboration: in companies hardest hit by the crisis shop stewards are more likely to find conflicts of interests between management and colleagues stressful and fewer feel respected by colleagues. Therefore, shop stewards’ engagement in local bargaining comes at a cost and may jeopardize their relations with colleagues. The analysis also reveals that shop stewards from time to time have to cooperate and engage in conflicts with management as well as colleagues as part of local bargaining. © The Author(s) 2013.","Collective bargaining; Danish model; Denmark; economic crisis; management–employee relations; shop stewards",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927128403

Design/methodology/approach – In order to embed the suggested framework empirically and thereby strengthen the argumentation, a total of 90 management accounts from 18 Danish professional football clubs have been analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach. The accounts cover a period of five consecutive seasons. Findings – The analysis shows that dismissing the coach is a frequent occurrence in Danish clubs. This finding is included in the discussion, in which it is suggested that a coach dismissal may be the outcome of mimetic, coercive or normative isomorphism. Research limitations/implications – The applied methodology makes it difficult to assess whether coach dismissals actually stem from institutional forces. A more extensive research design and methodological setup is required in order to elaborate the proposed framework. Practical implications – By focussing on the dynamics of club-stakeholder relationships, the proposed framework can be seen as an attempt to clarify key features of the decision-making process surrounding coach dismissals in European professional football. Furthermore, the framework suggests that in order for a club to stay attractive to its stakeholders, and thereby increase its chances of securing future financial support, club directors should pay attention to their external environment. Originality/value – In contrast to existing research, this study does not aim at assessing whether a coach dismissal pays off in terms of wins on the pitch. Instead, a qualitative approach has been selected in order to offer a framework that aims at providing an in-depth understanding of coach dismissals in professional football. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Coach dismissals; Danish professional football; Institutional logics; Isomorphism; Legitimacy; Sociological new institutional theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958531134

Most companies use a form of rule-based management approach, but surprisingly little is known about what makes companies change these rules. Furthermore, this management technology also has developed over time into different versions, but what drives firms from one version to another has only been suggested, not empirically studied. Design/methodology/approach – The dynamics of the rules of five companies are analyzed over a period of more than ten years based on three rounds of interviews with 40 managers. Findings – Previous research has assumed that the dynamics of product development rules are based on internal learning processes, and that increasingly competent management will stimulate the implementation of newer and more complex rule regimes. However, the analysis here indicates that there are different drivers, both internal and external, that cause companies to adopt new rules or modify their existing ones, such as changes in organizational structures, organizational conflicts and changes in ownership or strategy. In addition, contrary to the predictions in previous research, companies sometimes move back and forth between different generations of rules. Companies that havemoved to a more flexible third generation of rules might revert to their second generation rules, or supplement their flexibility with an increased level of management control and information systems. A model is proposed to explain the relationship between the drivers of rule change and the actual dynamics of rules, incorporating two sets of moderators: organizational moderators and rule-related moderators. Research limitations/implications – The findings indicate that many factors influence the modification of rules, and that there is no simple linear progression from one generation to another. Organizational learning is one among several other factors that influences the dynamics of rules for managing product development. Further research is needed to explore the dynamic relationship between different factors, the proposed moderators and changes to rules. Lack of historical record keeping in companies puts special requirements on research concerning rules. Practical implications – Companies need to consider how and why their present versions of rules have emerged, whether or not the existing rules can actually solve the challenges they face today, whether or not the rules support the intended company strategy, and what mechanisms influence their product development rules. Originality/value – A great deal of research has investigated the relationship between the uses of structured rule-based approaches to manage product development, but little is known about what makes these rules change. This is the first study to uncover the multitude of drivers that stimulate change in product development rules and to suggest sets of moderators that influence the outcome. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Organizational change; Organizational innovation; Product development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929733204

In particular, it describes how the sensemaking process leads the acquired and acquiring companies to maintain multiple identities, even after the formal conclusion of the integration process. Design/methodology/approach – The paper presents a grounded study based on a single case study (M&A between a German chemical multinational and an Italian/Swiss pharmaceutical firm). Findings – While many previous studies suggest that the evolution of OI reduces ambiguity by providing multiple identities under a shared commonality, this paper shows that multiple identities might survive within the same “new entity.” Research limitations/implications – Despite being based on a single case, the paper argues that the choice of maintaining multiple identities may be even more appropriate than the tendency to converge toward one of the old ones or toward a new one. The “sense” that employees and managers give to the same “words,” as well as the “sense” that they make for them, mirrors the perception they have of the OI. Practical implications – The conclusions presented could help managers to facilitate sensemaking as a means of dealing with multiple OIs. Originality/value – Differently from the extant literature, the paper concludes by stating that striking a balance between single and multiple identities might provide the ideal platform for building a new identity based on plurality. When the two (or more) organizational contexts present some complementarities, the existence of multiple identities, and its inner ambiguity, is not a problem per se. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Change management; Merger and acquisition (M&A); Organizational culture; Organizational identity; Pharmaceutical industry; Sensemaking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929323393

In particular, the paper aims to contribute a deeper understanding of the drivers of consumer travel behaviour and their interrelations. Design/methodology/approach – Based on a literature review, relevant influencing factors of shopping travel behaviour are identified and a theoretical model is deducted. Qualitative interviews were conducted to analyse the model, with interviewees chosen from five life cycles and three residential areas. Findings – The influencing factors of shopping travel behaviour differ among life cycles. There are two main aspects hindering environmentally friendly behaviour: the perceived necessity of mobility during the various life cycles (by which parents are particularly affected) and the negative evaluation of public transport in terms of flexibility and comfort. The life cycles are linked with a shopper typology, characterizing shopper types by shopping trip planning and the needs the transport modes should address. Research limitations/implications – The theoretical framework and the shopper typology can serve as a basis for future research. Practical implications – Retailers, transport service providers and policy makers should encourage environmentally friendly travel behaviour (e.g. delivery services offered by retailers would make public transport use more comfortable). Originality/value – While previous studies have analysed single influencing factors of shopping travel behaviour, we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework, synthesising several influencing factors.

Data were analyzed by means of structural equation modeling, checking for measurement invariance between samples. Findings – The reasons why Brazilian and Chinese consumers buy organic food are strikingly similar to what is found in Europe and North America. Consumers’ attitude toward buying organic food is strongly linked to beliefs about its healthiness, taste and environmental friendliness. Also, consumer attitudes toward buying organic food are positively related to what Schwartz’s “Universalism” values in all studied cultures.

Altering the aesthetic appearance of material surfaces, urban illuminations transform our sensory everynight experiences of space; experiences that, within geography, have not been dealt with in depth. This article undertakes an ethnographic study of the sensory everynight experiences of the changed aesthetics of illuminated spaces in Copenhagen, outlining three arguments. First, illumination functions as a signifier, transforming the experience of space and staging certain performative practices. Second, the illumination of select objects harmonizes connections between subjects and objects, releasing a potential for social contestation over spatial meaning. Third, illumination creates an illusory second reality, promoting alternative opportunities for engaging with the urban fabric. The article concludes that the lived sensory experiences of urban illuminations must be acknowledged in planning and need to be examined further within geographies of nighttime spaces. © The Author(s) 2014.","aesthetics; affect; illumination; lighting design; performativity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930690668

The driving motivation is to inform and inspire internal FM units of local institutions on how to navigate and manage collaboration of different, intra- and inter-organisational actors throughout ESCO projects. Design/methodology/approach – A deductive research methodology was applied based on the first ten ESCO projects in Danish municipalities between 2008 and 2012. Findings – A model of FM roles in FM public innovation is proposed. The internal FM unit coordinates between clients and end users by acting as translator and demonstrator and collaborates with the ESCO company to implement the energy renovation (FM processor). Research limitations/implications – The data were collected from a limited sample of ESCO collaborations in Denmark. Future research should thus investigate collaborative innovation in ESCO (and other forms of private–public) collaborations outside of Denmark. Practical implications – Not only should FM units clarify what different stakeholders expect from an ESCO collaboration, but also they should translate stakeholders’ expectations into actual goals and objectives; process them together with the ESCO company; demonstrate their execution to all stakeholders throughout the process, not just when closing the collaboration.

The purpose of this paper is to address the phenomenon of transgressive small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) formations and the limitations of SME globalisation research in capturing the connectivity of businesses in disjointed locations, and propose a qualitative case-study design to overcome these limitations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper critiques existing approaches to SME globalisation, which are informed by an interpretative community that conceives of territorial geography as the nodal point of SMEs and does not distinguish between internationalisation and globalisation. The paper thus addresses related methodological challenges. Based on a synthesis across disciplines and theoretical perspectives, the paper offers a reflexive method for case-study research, in the hope that such a method may increase the productiveness of analytical exploration of the multidimensional quality of SME organising and managing at the focal point of current transformations. Findings – The paper makes the case for SME globalisation research to move beyond societist and individualist ontologies to embrace social-constructionist thinking, to make practice the unit of casestudies, and to appreciate process geographies of managing and organising.

Specifically, the authors explore the activities and behaviors of employees with customer contact (i.e. boundary-spanning employees (BSEs)) to deepen and broaden their knowledge about customers for the development of innovations. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative research based on multiple semi-structured interviews with BSEs of six logistics service providers was conducted to explore the deepening and broadening of customer knowledge during innovation development. Data were analyzed for similarities and differences in BSEs’ knowledge acquisition and their interactions with customers across six innovations. Findings – Results show that BSEs engage sequentially in deepening and broadening customer knowledge throughout the logistics innovation development process. Yet, the specific sequence depends on the type of innovation developed (customized vs standardized).

Findings – The change process took different forms over time. At the time of concluding the analysis, positive dialectic forces were at play. City logistics schemes are still in an innovation phase. The biggest challenge in managing a process toward city logistics is to convince the many public and private stakeholders of their mutual interest and goals.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate variables assumed to be antecedents for this leadership approach. In particular, the authors examine the importance of external empowering leadership and task and goal interdependence for shared leadership as well as the relationship between shared leadership and team performance. Design/methodology/approach – In order to test the hypotheses, the authors applied structural equation modeling using a field sample of 81 knowledge and manufacturing teams from a Danish company. Findings – Results indicated that an external empowering team leader and interdependence in the team significantly predicted the extent of shared leadership, which, in turn, was positively related to team leader ratings of team performance. Research limitations/implications – Overall, the study supports previous findings that the act of sharing leadership in a team may contribute to increased team performance. In addition, the study provides an initial understanding of antecedent conditions for the successful development of shared leadership. However, as the study was cross-sectional and conducted within a single organization, care must be taken in making causal claims or in generalizing the results without additional evidence. Originality/value – Few studies focus on the antecedents of sharing leadership. The authors obtained evidence, which suggests that the development of shared leadership may depend on the presence of an empowering team leader as well as task and goal interdependence in the team. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Empowering leadership; Interdependence; Shared leadership; Team performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928988725

Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal case study encompassing the processes at the headquarters of the company and in two projects using lean. Findings - The operation strategy development commences at a middle level in the organisation, is underpinned and embedded in production projects and only after several years becomes embedded in the corporate operation strategy. Projects use lean principles in a differentiated manner. Research limitations/implications - A qualitative case study provides insight into only a single occasion of change in OS. More case studies would probably reveal several paths of OS development. OS development need to be handled as emergent, political and with contributions from several managers and management levels, bridging the vertical divides between projects and headquarter. Practical implications - A conscious and systematic vertical integration and interaction is crucial in project-based companies doing operation strategy development, something critically difficult at building contractors.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes to measure production competence as the two-dimensional operational level construct it actually is, and to use Slack's (1994) importanceperformance matrix to study its business level performance effects. The three hypotheses developed are tested using a subsample of the International Manufacturing Strategy Survey database, which includes 465 manufacturing companies from 21 countries. Findings - The study offers additional empirical support for production competence theory. Going beyond supporting existing theory, the results give more detailed insight by indicating that low operational performance on even one important competitive factor leads to lower business performance (order-losing effect); excessive investment in increasing operational performance on any less important competitive factor does not necessarily lead to higher business performance. Practical implications - Using a large empirical dataset, the study shows that the importanceperformance matrix is a useful tool for decision makers to assess and improve their company's manufacturing strategy: it indicates how to prioritize between improvement efforts to positively contribute to business performance. Originality/value - The paper offers a novel approach to operationalize production competence. The importance-performance analysis approach adopted in this study avoids the two major drawbacks of previous production competence studies and offers an appropriate method to assess the impact of production competence on business performance. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Business performance; Competitive priorities; Importance-performance matrix; Production competence; Survey","Decision making; Large dataset; Manufacture; Surveying; Surveys; Business performance; Competitive priorities; Design/methodology/approach; Importance-performance analysis; International manufacturing strategy surveys; Manufacturing companies; Operational performance; Performance matrices; Commerce",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928731484

To do this, the authors compared the expression of brand meaning across three key sources i.e. first, brand strategy (i.e. traditional marketing mix); second, corporate-generated media (i.e. web site); and third, consumer-generated media (Facebook). Design/methodology/approach – To address the research question of this study, the authors conducted an in-depth investigation into consumer co-creation experiences in the context of Facebook brand communities. The authors then interpreted the findings in relation to the brand strategy (i.e. marketing mix) and brand meaning expressed via corporate-generated online media (i.e. corporate web site). The authors achieved this by applying a narrative discourse analysisto textual data. To effectively handle the high quantity of textual data spawned via consumer-generated media (i.e. Facebook), the authors used a computer-assisted content analysis application (i.e. Leximancer). Findings – In the analyses the authors found that brand expressions varied considerably acrossthe chosen retail brands, but in all cases strong integration and alignment were present between the corporate and consumer-generated media. Specifically, the authors found that Facebook interactions echoed the brand meanings espoused on the corporate web sites. The findings indicate that online marketers can define the nature of brand co-creation, especially in the context of Facebook interactions. Practical implications – For marketers who are eager to take advantage of Web 2.0 to build their brand, the findings of this research are highly significant. The authors showed that the brands developed their own interaction profiles, which allowed them to align the Facebook content with their core brand values. The results indicate that sound brand governance is articulated through theeffective management of social media touchpoints by providing interactive, content rich, and relevant Facebook sites that echo core brand values. Originality/value – Even though businesses have now started to penetrate the online social networks and offer direct links from corporate web sites to social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, little is known regarding the relationship between social media and traditional media in brand building. This research addresses this gap by undertaking an exploratory study of Facebook brand communities with implications for brand co-creation and brand governance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Brand co-creation; Brand governance; Brand meaning; Brandscapes; Facebook; Social media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928011322

Design/methodology/approach-A survey was carried out among 400 people in southern Chile. The questionnaire measured willingness to buy FFs with 18 different benefits, knowledge about FFs, socio-demographic characteristics and satisfaction with life and with food-related life. Findings-Two dimensions were found for benefits sought in FFs: disease prevention and improvement of bodily functions. Cluster analysis was used to distinguish three types of consumers. The majority (59.8 per cent) showed a significant disposition to buy FFs that prevent diseases or improve bodily functions. Others (25.8 per cent) were less inclined to buy either type of FF. A minority (14.5 per cent) showed greater disposition to buy FFs which improve bodily functions. The types differ according to the size of family, presence and age of children at home, ethnic origin, education, socio-economic status, knowledge about FFs and satisfaction with life and food-related life.

Limited knowledge exists of zoo experiences; in particular children’s perspective on zoo visits is missing, just as parents–children interchanges and their effects on zoo experiences have been offered scant attention. Based on theories on family experiences as well as relevant studies on zoo visits, a theoretical framework is established. This considers both the perspective of parents and children and that zoo experiences are of a multiple nature and may hence consist of both central and peripheral experiences. By means of qualitative interviews with families visiting Aalborg Zoo, Denmark, it is discovered that the experiences children and parents gain from visiting a zoo differ. It is not, however, so much the nature of the experiences as it is the priority given to experiences that vary, and so zoo experiences of parents and children are to a high degree, mutually supportive. This, furthermore, means that family zoo visits appear relatively harmonious as both children and parents have their needs fulfilled. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","edutainment; entertainment; family experiences; social bonding; togetherness; zoo",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927176971

We examine a Wiki initiative at a major German bank to untangle the motivating factors behind KC and KI. Our results suggest KC and KI are indeed two distinct behaviors, reconcile inconsistent findings from past studies on the role of motivational factors for knowledge sharing to establish shared electronic knowledge resources in organizations, and identify factors that can be leveraged to tilt behaviors in favor of KC or KI. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Costs; Enterprise wiki; Knowledge creation; Knowledge integration; Knowledge management; Motivation; Rewards",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012929790

The approach involves an interactive process by which models are jointly developed with group members interacting face-to-face, with or without computer support. The models produced are used to inform negotiations about the nature of the issues faced by the group, and how to address them. While the facilitated modelling literature is impressive, published empirical research rarely examines what actually happens in a facilitated modelling environment. The present study addresses this gap by reporting on exploratory empirical research undertaken to closely examine the conduct of facilitated modelling within its actual context of immediate use, namely, the workshop. Drawing on the knowledge-perspective of group communication, we conducted a micro-level analysis of a transcript of a facilitated modelling workshop held with the management team of an Alternative Food Network in the UK. Our analysis suggests that facilitated modelling interactions can take the form of three distinct group knowledge production patterns: generative, collaborative and assertive. Further, each pattern is characterised by a particular mix of communicative behaviours and model-supported interactions that has implications for the creation of new knowledge within the workshop. Our findings contribute to increasing our understanding of the nature of facilitated modelling within its context of use. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Facilitated modelling; Group negotiation; Knowledge production; Micro-level analysis; Workshops",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939885317

But adequate and fitting resource flows are not automatic, as suppliers allocate and activate their resources for more customers in their portfolio. Therefore, buying companies also need to influence supplier actors to prioritize and optimize resource flows into their specific exchange. Based on a theoretical basis comprising the literature on buyer-seller relationship, including resource based research of the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) group, as well as Dynamic Capabilities theory and the project management literature, this paper presents the results from a study of applied buying company resource mobilization routines. We report on a qualitative investigation of routines applied in complex construction projects in the North European offshore wind turbine industry. Complex construction/production projects are widespread global business phenomena, but knowledge of resource mobilization routines in this context is scarce in the literature.

With non-verifiable output, rewarding agents based on team performance can relax the principal's credibility constraint by smoothing bonus payments over time. Team incentives also induce free-riding, but the principal prefers them to individual incentives if effort costs are relatively high and problems difficult to solve. We show that a simple mixture of an individual and team bonus constitutes the optimal relational contract under joint performance evaluation. The optimal contract may be inefficient when team size is endogenous, as rewarding team performance forces the principal to share surplus with agents, but may allow him to motivate a larger group.

This paper tries to unravel these two effects by exploring a novel empirical strategy based on continuous time duration models with selection. We use a large longitudinal matched employer-employee dataset that allows us to identify about 220,000 individuals who have left their first entrepreneurial experience, out of which over 35,000 became serial entrepreneurs. We evaluate whether entrepreneurial experience acquired in the previous business improves serial entrepreneurs' survival, after taking into account self-selection issues. Our results show that serial entrepreneurs are not a random sample of ex-business owners. Robustness tests based on the estimation of the person-specific effect, using information on individuals' past histories in paid employment, confirm that serial entrepreneurs exhibit, on average, a larger person-specific effect than non-serial business owners. Moreover, ignoring serial entrepreneurs' self-selection overestimates learning by doing effects. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In fact, business model design is often associated with innovation. Many firms, though, fail to realize the full potential of their current business model simply because they are not aware of it. Nevertheless, Google succeeded in realizing its business model's full potential by offering its main service, Internet search, completely for free while capturing value from secondary opportunities such as Google AdWords. Especially for new ventures and SMEs, capturing value from secondary opportunities or business model sophistication is of critical importance toward increasing the pool of resources at hand and giving momentum to the firm's development. But what are these opportunities, and where can they be found? Based on various examples including Google, Ryanair, the Super Girl Contest on Hunan TV, and Spreadshirt, this article develops a framework that introduces five business model sophistication strategies: (1) uncover additional functions of your product, (2) identify strategic benefits for third parties, (3) take advantage of economies of scope, (4) utilize cross-selling opportunities, and (5) involve users and the crowd. All five strategies place a strong emphasis on stakeholder commitment. © 2015 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.","Business model sophistication; New venture strategy; SME strategy; Social media; Value capturing; Valueholder",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928827467

It investigates how R&D and production interact with each other in their globalisation processes. Design/methodology/approach – The research aim is developed by identifying the gaps in the reviewed literature. This paper is based on four case studies undertaken in one Chinese manufacturing, one Danish pharmaceutical and two Danish manufacturing companies. The cases provide a sound basis for developing an understanding of the interaction between the globalization of R&D and production. Findings – This paper identifies three approaches the case companies followed to globalise their production and R&D: interactive globalisation, separated globalisation and a possible combination. The paper indicates that research and development might have to be treated separately with regard to their globalisation, and proposes industry and country characteristics as the key factors for globalisation approach selection, and site capability and strategic decision as the impacting factors for globalisation evolution. Originality/value – This paper emphasises the dispersion of R&D activities, which is seldom addressed by existing internationalisation theories. Its investigation provides a foundation for the further extension of current internationalisation theories to consider global R&D. Moreover, the theoretical gap in the existing literature between global R&D and production is noted. This paper bridges this gap by clarifying the interaction between R&D and production in their globalisation, conceptualising three globalisation approaches, and proposing tentative factors that have impacts on approach selection and management. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case studies; Global production; Global R&D; Globalization; Interaction; Research and development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928667840

Both experiments found that exposing citizens to a patient dissatisfaction measure led to more negative views of public service than exposing them to a logically equivalent satisfaction metric. There is some support for part of the shift in evaluations being caused by a negativity bias: dissatisfaction has a larger negative impact than satisfaction has a positive impact. Both professional experience at a hospital and prior exposure to satisfaction rates reduced the negative response to dissatisfaction rates.

Two types of consumer product tests used generally are central location tests (CLT) and home use tests (HUT) where the acceptability or liking of a product or group of products is determined together with the view of whether one product is preferred over other products. This article explores the similarities and differences between CLT and HUT test results in a LL context. In both settings, the acceptance of five flavoured chocolate bars was evaluated for appearance, odour, taste/flavour, texture and overall liking. Apart from the mean values of liking in the two tests, data were analysed to identify consumer segments. Qualitative data were also collected by asking for consumer comments on the tested samples. The results show that independent of test method the bars were evaluated equally and all accepted by the consumers. A clear difference between CLT and HUT testing was that CLT consumers significantly differed from the HUT consumers, giving the test samples lower scores. For example, the mean values of the overall acceptance scores given by HUT consumers varied between 6.0 and 6.6, while for CLT consumers the corresponding values varied from 5.4 to 5.9. Another difference was the number of comments from consumers. CLT consumers richly commented on the products in a verbose way, while HUT consumers used the opportunity to comment very sparingly. Considering the cluster analysis as yet another difference between the testing methods, clusters from the CLT were more distinct and the number was higher with five clusters in CLT and four in HUT. Clusters where consumers liked all the products in both test settings were twice as many for HUT than in CLT. Applying the LL approach, there is a need for methods and approaches that capture a rich picture of consumers during test performance without being intrusive or obstructive of activities and context. The approach offers the opportunity for companies to have consumers not only test products but also offer input that can stimulate new innovations and give consumers more power and influence. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Central located test; Chocolate bar; Consumer; Home use test; Living lab; Product acceptance/liking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926682988

We draw on theories of political CSR and organizational identity–image relations to study how CSR emerges as a corporate political activity in a context where the corporate CSR work is first appreciated and later critiqued by the public in the wake of socio-political events. We analyse the micro-organizational processes in the context of macro-political level changes, and we refer to this as the ‘identity–image dynamics of political CSR’. Concretely, we describe in two vignettes how IKEA’s declared ‘apolitical and neutral’ CSR identity becomes entangled with national and international socio-political events that critically challenge the corporate engagement prior national understandings of citizenship rights. In this process, IKEA’s CSR identity becomes defined as a political and non-neutral activity. Our article contributes by bringing attention to the organizational level dynamics of political CSR by offering a conceptualization of how global and local socio-political events may disturb the alignment between CSR identity and image and challenge the corporate CSR work beyond managerial control. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Corporate social responsibility (CSR); CSR identity; IKEA; Organizational identity–image relations; Political CSR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895107379

As a cooperative device based on risk pooling, it serves to attenuate the adverse consequences of various risks (health, unemployment, natural catastrophes and so forth) by offering policyholders coverage against the losses implied by adverse events in exchange for the payment of premiums. In the insurance industry, the concept of actuarial fairness serves to establish what could be adequate, fair premiums. Accordingly, premiums paid by policyholders should match as closely as possible their risk exposure (i.e. their expected losses). Such premiums are the product of the probabilities of losses and the expected losses. This article presents a discussion of the fairness of actuarial fairness through three steps: (1) defining the concept based on its formulation within the insurance industry; (2) determining in which sense it may be about fairness; and (3) raising some objections to the actual fairness of actuarial fairness. The necessity of a normative evaluation of actuarial fairness is justified by the influence of the concept on the current reforms of public insurance systems and the fact that it highlights the question of the repartition of the gains and burdens of social cooperation. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cooperation; Expected utility; Fairness; Insurance; Premiums; Responsibility",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894726540

The hypothesis is that clustered regions with high entrepreneurial and innovative performance have higher growth than non-innovative/entrepreneurial regions or regions with a more scattered economic structure. The clustering and in some cases even the polarization of economic activities in metropolitan regions can lead to excess growth and contribute to a process of convergence between nations but will also turn regional economic divergence back on the national economic development agenda. © 2015, IGI Global.

GSI is also assumed to have a direct effect on ATT. The attitude towards the electric car then determines the intention to adopt it. The model is empirically tested in three culturally different European countries: Denmark, Belgium and Italy. Results show that the three countries differ in the way they develop positive attitudes and intentions towards the electric car on the basis of their green self-identity. In Denmark, GSI strongly and directly leads to positive attitudes. In Belgium, ATT is mainly formed through the development of a strong EC. In Italy, MO plays a dominant role in the development of positive attitudes. We suggest explanations using Hofstede's values framework. © 2015 by IGI Global.

As such, this immensely popular religious tradition constitutes a social practice that is deeply tied to the landscapes and places that are considered to be holy and thus principally worthy of preservation (at least by many definitions of heritage), but which also in many cases ultimately consumes them over time, sometimes in very direct ways that immediately affect their physical state. This paper explores the contemporary and historical dimensions of this paradox, and considers the wider implications of seemingly destructive uses of sacred space by investigating the social and religious significance of so-called pilgrims gouges observable at numerous pilgrimage sites in the Eastern Mediterranean. It, thereby, sheds light on the connections between the religious experience of pilgrimage and the material consumption of sacred places by juxtaposing cases from contemporary Islamic Syria and ancient Egypt, providing a long-term perspective on the use and consumption of sacred places. Lastly, it discusses the potential ramifications of the gouges for current approaches to heritage management and conservation. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.","devotional practices; Egypt; gouging; pilgrimage; Syria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924051693

Secondly, I point to a heritage allegedly neglected by the state, the religious shrines of the Shia community, which to this group signify an alternative heritage and history of the islands. Finally, I discuss a potential heritage of the future, based on the recent destruction by Bahraini authorities of the Pearl Monument, which was the centre of the 2011 uprising in Bahrain as part of the so-called Arab Spring.

An existing supply chain (SC) is involved in the manufacturing and distribution of new products, while the new (to-be-designed) rival SC can supply both new and remanufactured products. Competitions exist not only externally between the two chains supplying new products to the same market, but also internally in the new chain for the supply of new and remanufactured products. The performance behaviors of both SCs are evaluated with specific focus placed on investigating the impacts of the strategic facility location decisions of the new SC on the tactical/operational transport and inventory decisions of the overall network.

We challenge this perception by investigating how employers in multinational companies in Denmark and Norway communicate with employees on staffing changes. We argue that the development of ‘flexicurity’ in Denmark grants Danish employers considerably greater latitude in engaging in staffing changes than its Nordic counterpart, Norway. Institutional theory leads us to suppose that large firms located in the Danish setting will be less likely to engage in employer–employee communication on staffing plans than their Norwegian counterparts. In addition, we argue that in the Danish context indigenous firms will have a better insight into the normative and cognitive aspects to flexicurity than foreign-owned firms, meaning that they are more likely to engage in institutional entrepreneurialism than their foreign-owned counterparts. We supplement institutional theory with an actor perspective in order to take into account the role of labor unions. Our analysis is based on a survey of 203 firms in Norway and Denmark which are either indigenous multinational companies or the subsidiaries of foreign multinational companies. The differences we observe cause us to conclude that the notion of a common Nordic model is problematic. © Australian Labour and Employment Relations Association (ALERA), SAGE Publications Ltd, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, Singapore and Washington DC.","Flexicurity; institutional theory; multinational companies; staffing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927554555

Thus, it is highly relevant to understand better how knowledge is transferred from one generation to the next in family businesses. The purpose of this paper is to link the competitive advantage realisation in family businesses to the success of transferring strategically valuable knowledge in different business environments to the next generation. Design/methodology/approach – Building on the contingency model of family business succession (Royer et al., 2008) knowledge transfer in family businesses from different cultures is investigated in this paper. From a resource-oriented and transaction cost inspired perspective two family businesses with a similar industry background from China and Europe are compared regarding knowledge transfer in the context of family firm succession taking into account the respective transaction atmosphere. Findings – Different successions for two long-lived family firms are illustrated in a systematic fashion: based on the theoretical elements suggested both cases are described to get insights into the usefulness of the theoretical reasoning developed. On the basis of these, the cases are compared with each other and conclusions for both cases are drawn. Implications for theory and practice as well as avenues for future research are sketched. Originality/value – The focus of the current study is to gain more insight into long-lived family businesses by comparing two cases over a period of more than 200 years with regard to strategically relevant resources as well as the underlying transaction atmospheres.

Leading financial economist Lasse Heje Pedersen combines the latest research with real-world examples and interviews with top hedge fund managers to show how certain trading strategies make money-and why they sometimes don't. Pedersen views markets as neither perfectly efficient nor completely inefficient. Rather, they are inefficient enough that money managers can be compensated for their costs through the profits of their trading strategies and efficient enough that the profits after costs do not encourage additional active investing. Understanding how to trade in this efficiently inefficient market provides a new, engaging way to learn finance. Pedersen analyzes how the market price of stocks and bonds can differ from the model price, leading to new perspectives on the relationship between trading results and finance theory. He explores several different areas in depth-fundamental tools for investment management, equity strategies, macro strategies, and arbitrage strategies-and he looks at such diverse topics as portfolio choice, risk management, equity valuation, and yield curve logic. The book's strategies are illuminated further by interviews with leading hedge fund managers: Lee Ainslie, Cliff Asness, Jim Chanos, Ken Griffin, David Harding, John Paulson, Myron Scholes, and George Soros.

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the theoretical underpinnings of the literature on health promotion capacity building and, further, to suggest an alternative theoretical perspective which draws on recent developments in organizational theory. Design/methodology/approach-The paper begins by a critical discussion of the capacity building literature, which is juxtaposed with the relational perspective of contemporary organizational theory. The theoretical argument is developed in reference to the case of Danish municipal health promotion agencies, drawing on secondary sources as well as ethnographic fieldwork among public health officers. Findings-The capacity building literature tends to reify the concept of capacity. In contrast, this paper argues that health promotion capacity is constantly defined and redefined through processes of organizing. The case study suggests that, faced with limited resources and limited knowledge, health promotion officials attain a sense of capacity through an ongoing reworking of organizational forms. Research limitations/implications-Organizational health promotion research should look for the organizational forms that are conducive to health promotion practices under shifting social circumstances.

Design/methodology/approach – The paper performs an interpretive analysis of the expatriate amateur scene from an ethnographic perspective, combining observations of rehearsals and performances, in-depth interviews with actors, directors and audience, and secondary data. Findings – The fluidity of global cities allows their inhabitants to engage in creative processes of cultural experimentation, performing a continuous back-and-forth movement between hybridization and pluralization. The former creates enough homogeneity for the expatriates to feel targeted; the latter ensures a level of cultural diversity necessary to satisfy their cosmopolitan aspirations. Practical implications – The paper points to the important role of global cities for cultural experimentation. Such cities are not only an interesting market for culturally diverse products, but also experimental hubs. Managers willing to address multicultural marketplaces might target these markets with dynamic cultural offers that ensure a balance between rendering a product globally appreciated and recognizable, and maintaining a cosmopolitan appeal for consumers in search of diversity. Originality/value – Drawing on global cities as markets in continuous reconstruction and subject to cultural experimentation, the paper turns the attention of the research community to the collective, reflexive, and experimental aspects of symbolic consumption. It shows how arts and cultural products represent valuable contexts for international marketing research, providing original insights into market dynamics and cultural experimentation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cosmopolitanism; Cultural experimentation; Cultural hybridization; Cultural pluralism; Global cities; Multicultural marketplace",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927167653

Our case study leads us to document four ‘identity stratagems’ (Jenkins, 1996) through which members incorporate elements of their past professional experience into their self-narratives: nostalgia, reproduction, validation and combination.

Coordination can be formal or informal. Research shows that informal coordination of residual and unforeseen interdependencies enhances time saving and facilitates better understandings. Still though, many sub-contractors choose not to coordinate informally. The purpose of this paper is to identify drivers that enhance or inhibit informal coordination among sub-contractors during project execution. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative, explorative case study approach was applied, involving 15 SME sub-contractors within the offshore wind power energy sector. Findings – Six drivers which enhance informal coordination and three drivers which inhibit informal coordination among sub-contractors in projects were identified. Practical implications – The findings imply that management in project-oriented organizations can enhance informal coordination across project sub-contractors in the project execution phase by facilitating trust building; by emphasizing previous collaboration successes with the sub-contractors and the possibility of future common projects; by being explicit about expectations on informal coordination; and by developing sub-contractor contracts that are not very tight in economic terms, but instead give some leeway in relation to coordination.

The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the role of CSR communication and the development of theory and practice of CSR Communication in recent years. Design/methodology/approach – The editorial sets up a research agenda for the future, the premises outlined about the role of CSR communication being based on Habermas’ (1984) idea of instrumental/ strategic and communicative action. Findings – The theoretically based research shows that there are different framings of CSR. In the first framing, the business discourse is trying to institutionalize CSR and sustainability by pursuing CSR purely as a business case. In the second framing, alternative CSR discourses are challenging the business discourse, communication being oriented towards shared understanding. Originality/value – The above findings are original insofar as they have implications for CSR communication scholars and practitioners. It is, for example, important that they acknowledge that two kinds of framings exist, and that they are interdependent. Hence, they should not fall into the trap of a critical discourse of suspicion where CSR communication is constantly criticized as a tool to serve business interests.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of Facebook by examining – if the public represented on Facebook contributes distinct frames to the discursive negotiation of a crisis at all, and whether the public represented on Facebook is able to influence the crisis framing of news media. Design/methodology/approach – The authors compared how four different public sources framed the Nestlé Kit Kat crisis: news media, corporate communication, NGOs, and Facebook users. The authors therefore, coded 5,185 sentences from the four sources and conducted a frame-analysis through the detection of co-occurrence between actors and attributions. A cross-correlation with a seven-day lag in each direction was applied to detect the frame-setting effects between the public represented on Facebook and news media. Findings – While the public represented on Facebook is found to apply distinct crisis frames in comparison to conventional sources, its frame-setting power is limited. In contrast to findings from political communication, it is rather the news media that influences the crisis framing in social media. The role of the public represented on Facebook, hence, appears marginal in comparison to news media that remain a major force in the discursive negotiation of a corporate crisis. Originality/value – As a first study, crisis framing in social media is compared with that of news media, NGOs, and corporate communication.

The assumption is that a considerable number of innovations in service industries are initiated in service encounters and that employees are the core factor in connecting customers with the innovating organization. Based on literature studies and pilot case studies, seven propositions are proposed and tested in a qualitative, hermeneutic way in field experiments in nine service organizations. Important new results are that encounter-based innovation requires mutual empathy between employees and customers, employees investing stubbornness and time can be a driver for innovation, and several layers of management can be a barrier. In the field experiments three new factors for encounter-based innovation were found: translation, multitasking, and hyper-professionalism. The two first are drivers; the third a barrier.

Focusing on families, this paper draws on 210 qualitative in situ interviews with 437 people spending the holidays at 5 different Danish caravan sites.The study points to ‘family time’ and children's ‘own time’ as interdependent entities that allow for the balancing of social identities (pursued through family time) and more individual interests (pursued through own time). Compared to extant theory, caravanning seems to allow for more ‘own time’ and ‘spouse time’ for adults, because children have extraordinary opportunities to engage in ‘own time’. Furthermore, the study suggests that ‘real, quality family time’ is best achieved insofar one ‘has not seen the kids for hours’ in between the precious moments of thick sociality and family togetherness that involve all family members. © 2015 Australia and New Zealand Association of Leisure Studies.","caravanning; children; family holidays; family time; own time",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940487878

Service programs are generally highly demanded by citizens and some—but not all—citizens are active service users. By nesting two experiments in a survey of 1,866 Danish citizens, the research shows that performance information matters more to service attitudes if allocated in conjunction with cost information and that performance information is more important to the attitudes of service users than to those of non-users. These findings suggest that information on performance for specific services should be presented simultaneously with information on costs in order to create more nuanced attitudes among citizens and that this is of particular importance in service areas with major groups of core users. © 2015, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931411751

Governments are therefore seeking different ways to enhance citizen coproduction. Yet, empirical studies examining the effect of different government strategies to enhance citizen coproduction remain scarce and face problems of endogeneity. In this study, we examine the effect on citizen coproduction of a simple government initiative sending information material containing encouragement and advice to citizens—an often-applied strategy to enhance citizen participation. We use a field experiment on educational services (n > 1,400) to handle endogeneity problems and at the same time examine the effect in an actual public administration setting.

Methodology/approach: The authors use the Leximancer computer-aided text analysis program, which reliably and reproducibly identifies the main concepts embedded in the text—their frequency and patterns of co-occurrence—based on the ways words move together in the text. They also identify key concepts that differentiate among the networks of concepts occurring in each of the first four five-year periods of the Journal’s history. Findings: There are four common underlying conceptual themes: relationships, market, study, and business. But the focal mix of concepts has changed over time, from a narrower initial focus on distribution and power and conflict, to a greater focus on firm business marketing strategy and pedagogy, to a focus on networks, the Internet and more collaborative relations, to a focus, in the most recent period, on psycho-social network concepts, such as trust and commitment. Research implications: The results complement and provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing researcher-conducted literature reviews of business marketing and JBBM’s contributions. The methodology provides possibilities for further analysis as it can be extended to analyze the business marketing and wider marketing literature more generally and how it has evolved. Practical implications: Leximancer provides a comprehensive, accessible summary of the content of the JBBM and demonstrates its value as a text analysis program. Originality/value/contribution: The authors are among the first to use this novel computer text analysis program to conduct a scientometric analyses of journal content.

Many foreign multinationals are eager to exploit the entrepreneurial opportunities potentially related to less developed but fast growing markets. This is not a new phenomenon. Multinationals from more developed countries have for long searched for opportunities in less developed markets and have dealt with the related challenges. Foreign environments with different needs and capabilities, unstable institutions and policies, stark fluctuations in the macroeconomic environment and unrealistic expectations are just some of the obstacles for ‘turning potential into profits.’ The history of multinational enterprises (MNEs) knows many examples of economies with these characteristics similar to modern understandings of ‘emerging markets.’ This special issue analyzes foreign multinationals in emerging markets from a historical perspective. It seeks to understand changes and continuities in the opportunities and challenges less developed markets presented for MNEs, and in the various ways in which their managers responded to these. Rather than relying on the ‘emerging market’ label, we ask (1) why managers perceived certain markets as ‘emerging’ and which expectations they had when investing in these markets, (2) which challenges they faced there, and (3) how they subsequently addressed them. By tracing and comparing these investments and their consequences over time (and space), we hope to shed more light on managerial decisions and understand to what extent they were shaped by the specific context or, possibly, had more of a timeless nature – with the findings ultimately intended to help inform contemporary decision-making.

Using a sample of 671 professionals in the Egyptian higher education and health sectors, a mediation model is outlined and tested empirically using structural equation modeling. Our results show that PSM positively affected P-O fit, which in turn had significant positive associations with OCBs and negative associations with work-related stress and quit intentions. Although P-O fit explained a high proportion of mediation in the relationship between PSM, stress, and quit intentions, it only explained a low proportion in the relationship between PSM and OCBs. In general, our findings suggest that if public managers are desirous of improving employee experience at work, then achieving congruence between employees' and organizational values is important. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

However, the discourse on 'management innovation' attributes a curious dual function to the concept of management. On the one hand, management is portrayed as the 'toxin' that can impede innovation. But on the other hand, management is portrayed the 'cure' that will heal the defects that prevents innovation. Informed by Derrida's reflection upon the dual meaning of pharmakon, a word that means both 'remedy' and 'poison', the paper engages with Hamel's popular management handbook The Future of Management. Although Hamel attempts to establish a clear-cut distinction between those principles of management that obstruct and those that facilitate innovation, one is ultimately left uncertain whether management is a cure or a poison for innovation. This ambivalence points to an underlying paradox of contemporary post-managerial thinking that is characterized by incorporating transgression into its productive logic. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Deconstruction; Gary Hamel; Jacques Derrida; Management gurus; Management innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939885495

Business model innovation is not only becoming more and more important due to increasing and globalizing competition, but also an enormous challenge, both theoretically and practically. Although many managers are eager to consider more disruptive changes to their business model, they often do not know how to articulate their existing or desired business model and, even less so, understand the possibilities for innovating it. One of the steps toward developing more theoretical insight and practical guidelines is the identification of types and the development of a typology of business model innovations. Ten retrospective case studies of business model innovations undertaken by two industrial companies provide the empirical basis for this article. We analyzed the characteristics of these innovations as well as their success rates. The findings suggest that there are indeed various business model innovation types, each with its own characteristics and challenges. © 2015 Decision Sciences Institute.","Case studies; Organizational theory; Strategic decision making",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928394757

Moderate turbulence reduces the value of flexibility by making supplier selection more difficult and increases the value of commitment by mitigating the status quo bias of integrated structures. Both effects improve the value of integration. Higher levels of turbulence undermine the adaptive benefits of commitment, but have a less adverse effect on flexibility, making nonintegration more attractive.

Food shape abnormalities influence consumers' purchase intentions, but only if the food deviates extremely from the norm; no differences in purchase intentions emerge for moderately abnormal food. Awareness of food waste issues and proenvironmental self-identities also drive purchase intentions, such that participants with high levels of these traits express significantly higher purchase intentions for abnormally shaped food.

We start by briefly discussing the state of the art in research and policy making related to science, technology and ageing. We argue that an important gap characterizes this state of the art: current approaches do not consider material practice and materiality to be an inherent part of later life as constituted in contemporary societies. Science and Technology Studies (STS) provide both the theories and methods to address this gap, and thus deploy a theoretical and empirical understanding of science, technology and ageing that captures how later life co-evolves with the practices of technology use and design. We briefly discuss how the articles in the collection each contribute to such an understanding across various locations. We conclude that, together, the contributions specify a perspective on the socio-material constitution of later life that implicates an important agenda for the future study of ageing and gerontechnology innovation. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Ageing; Gerontechnology; Materiality; Science and technology studies",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924345856

Agents adapt to changing environments within one generation by using their respective learning strategy. The frequency of the agent types adapts between generations according to the agents' acquired wealth. During the course of evolution, social learning becomes dominant, resulting in three major effects: First, for better or worse, the decisions of social learners are more exaggerated than those of individual learners. Second, social learners react with a delay to changes in the environment. Third, the behavior of social learners becomes more and more detached from reality.

The FCVAR model allows for long memory (fractional integration) in the equilibrium errors, and, following Figuerola-Ferretti and Gonzalo (2010), we allow for the existence of long-run backwardation or contango in the equilibrium as well, that is, a non-unit cointegration coefficient. Price discovery can be analyzed in the FCVAR model by a relatively straightforward examination of the adjustment coefficients. In our empirical analysis, we use the data from Figuerola-Ferretti and Gonzalo (2010), who conduct a similar analysis using the usual (non-fractional) CVAR model. Our first finding is that, for all markets except copper, the fractional integration parameter is highly significant, showing that the usual, non-fractional model is not appropriate. Next, when allowing for fractional integration in the long-run equilibrium relations, fewer lags are needed in the autoregressive formulation, further stressing the usefulness of the fractional model. Compared to the results from the non-fractional model, we find slightly more evidence of price discovery in the spot market. Specifically, using standard likelihood ratio tests, we do not reject the hypothesis that price discovery takes place exclusively in the spot (futures) market for copper, lead, and zinc (aluminum and nickel). © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923925717

This calls for an examination of the current practices of disseminating pop/rock heritage through exhibitions. Two trends have been identified and criticised by previous commentators: first, the prominence of nostalgia in exhibition narratives and second, that exhibitions of popular music tend to display ancillary objects rather than music itself. This article offers a rethinking of nostalgia as a strategy for disseminating pop/rock heritage and explores the potential of music as a trigger for nostalgic experiences in exhibitions. While agreeing with much of the critique levelled at the nostalgic approach to pop/rock culture, we suggest that with a more nuanced conception of reflective nostalgia, the affective appeal of the nostalgic approach can be harnessed without giving in to glamourised oversimplifications of the past. Further, we suggest that mediated memories can form the basis of nostalgic feelings and thus enable the nostalgic approach to span the generational gap and engage visitors who do not have a lived experience of pop/rock heritage. We will illustrate this by contrasting our approach to that taken at ABBA The Museum. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","exhibition design; memory; nostalgia; Pop/Rock Heritage; sound in exhibitions",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921562252

The essays contribute to a trans-disciplinary scholarship on contemporary economic practice and change by documenting how, across diverse settings, ""gift-like"" socialities proliferate, and even sustain the intensified flexible commoditization that more commonly is touted as tearing social relations apart.

The massive involvement of lay publics as instrumented by social media breaks with the strong expert cultures that have underlain the production and use of data in modern organizations. It also sets apart the interactive and communicative processes by which social data is produced from sensor data and the technological recording of facts. We further discuss the significance of the very mechanisms by which big data is produced as distinct from the very attributes of big data, often discussed in the literature.

Big data often represents miscellaneous records of the whereabouts of large and shifting online crowds. It is frequently agnostic, in the sense of being produced for generic purposes or purposes different from those sought by big data crunching. It is based on varying formats and modes of communication (e.g., texts, image and sound), raising severe problems of semiotic translation and meaning compatibility. Crucially, the usefulness of big data rests on their steady updatability, a condition that reduces the time span within which this data is useful or relevant. Jointly, these attributes challenge established rules of strategy making as these are manifested in the canons of procuring structured information of lasting value that addresses specific and long-term organizational objectives. The developments underlying big data thus seem to carry important implications for strategy making, and the data and information practices with which strategy has been associated. We conclude by placing the understanding of these changes within the wider social and institutional context of longstanding data practices and the significance they carry for management and organizations. © 2015 JIT Palgrave Macmillan All rights reserved.","Big data; Business environment; Data practices; Management; Social data; Strategy making","Management; Business environments; Data and information; Data crunching; Data practices; Institutional contexts; Social datum; Strategy making; Structured information; Big data",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925963684

As craft editing is mediated by digital images, its contextual embeddedness is transformed by context-independent standards of computation and metadata resulting in the erosion of the contextual boundaries of the practice.

Empirically, this is done through an analysis of video material produced by the film company Zentropa about their apparently eccentric Managing Director, Peter Aalbæk. Contrary to much of the literature discussing embodiment and ethics in organization studies, we do not identify an ‘ethics of organization’ dominated by instrumental rationality, efficiency and desire for profit which is ostensibly juxtaposed to a non-alienating, embodied ethics.

In particular, supermarkets, hypermarkets and larger retail chains are governed by a space management tradition that heavily draws on principles of utilitarianism and instrumental rationality. Yet, any physical retail space accommodates a separate and distinctive, but not independent, social space which must equally be addressed if attractive retail spaces are to be grasped, created and maintained. In fact, the standardized and repetitive design of many larger retail environments such as supermarkets appears to build on uncontested traditions of space management and tenacious myths about consumer behaviour and preferences that are challenged as urban design studies are consulted. In reference to current urban design research, the article concludes by suggesting five propositions and measurements for the customer-centric quality of retail spaces that take as a starting point the appreciation of the social space that any retail space management presupposes. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","atmospherics; built environment; customer experience; nudging; retail layout; servicescape; space management; urban design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924205180

This extra waste (unsold wines) have to be handled in order to not aggravate the wine environmental impacts. With the aim to reduce this surplus, the present research evaluates new grape uses: by blending them with other fruits in the formulation of a ""100% fruit juice"". The idea is to move from a linear model, in which grapes are grown only for wine production, to a complex one, in which grapes are grown for other uses too, in order to obtain a better use of raw materials, as opposed to waste production. This research apply a particular form of Industrial Ecology, integrating raw materials among farms. In order to evaluate the idea, a life cycle assessment was carried out, to make a comparison of two scenarios (the linear and the complex). Results show reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and a reduced amount of unsold wine to be treated. The wider market scenario provides healthy products to consumers: fruit juices. Regarding this last point, it should be emphasized that this fruit juice concept is already on the market since two years. This approach to wine surplus has demonstrated that transferring part of the must to the fruit juice production lightens the environmental load of a company (increased sustainability), lightens the unsold wine problem (increased efficiency in the resources use), and expands market opportunity by providing healthy products to consumers (increased competitiveness). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the assigned Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEA) tend to have a too narrow focus. In particular, there is a need for applying a system perspective in SEA, extending assessment beyond the spatial boundaries of a plan to further focus on global, indirect and cumulative impacts. These impacts are referred to as ""systemic impacts"". This study proposes a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) procedure which can be adopted in SEAs of various types of planning. The procedure represents a first step towards operationalising LCA in SEA by adjusting LCA methodology to focus on the ways planners and planning processes can influence the environmental impacts of interconnected activities. The proposed procedure was tested on a case study of Danish extraction planning, and it was found to generate new knowledge for decision support. The procedure enabled identification of key systemic impacts, as well as it enabled formulation of recommendations for how to address these impacts in planning processes. On a more general level, this article demonstrates an application of LCA which until now has received little attention, and it highlights the role of spatial planners in facilitating cleaner production. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the quality of contact with the host is pivotal to benefit most from this experience, the purpose of this paper is to examine which factors influence contact quality. Design/methodology/approach – The authors conducted a case study analysis of 33 expatriates and ten accompanying partners who were put in touch with a local host, with whom they undertook a broad range of activities during a period of nine months. Findings – Nine factors influenced the development of the contact (similarities, motivation, benefits, anxiety, expectations, busy schedules, suboptimal timing, communication breakdown, and cultural differences). Key factors were similarities, motivation, and benefits. Research limitations/implications – While some of the factors (e.g. similarities) are predictable according to the Social Penetration Theory, four factors were uniquely applicable to purposely created relationships such as contact with a local host: motivation, expectations, anxiety, and suboptimal timing. Practical implications – The study provides suggestions that could stimulate the contact with a local host, making the intervention more valuable for organisations who wish to support their expatriates in this way.

Design/methodology/approach: The research was conducted in three networks with a sample of 55 separate SMEs. Through a quantitative study, the anticipated positive impact of passion and compassion on growth and on intermediate innovation issues were tested. Findings: The analyses reveal no direct significant impacts of passion (own-profitability and interest) and compassion (other-profitability and interest) on growth. However, compassion had a very significant positive impact on manager ideas, which in turn had a positive impact on growth. Passion also had a positive impact, but this was proportionally much smaller. Moreover, the ability to organise the dualities of passion and compassion made a contribution to growth. Research limitations/implications: The results of the research enhance the understanding of an integrative approach of passion and compassion to innovation in a network context. Practical implications: Networking SMEs can use the findings to better understand and organise own actions to pursue growth. Policy bodies can use the findings to motivate SMEs to pursue growth. Originality/value: The findings of this study enhance the theoretical understanding of passion and compassion and their integrated impact on growth.

This development has to a large extent been driven by efficiency and cost-effectiveness concerns, but may also result in important changes in the working conditions and work environment for the personnel in public organizations. In this article, we present the findings from a systematic review of studies documenting the consequences of contracting out for employees. The review is based on 26 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2012. We find both positive and negative effects for employees documented in the literature, although with a predominance of negative effects, including reductions in the workforce and other changes in the workforce composition such as the replacement of experienced employees with younger workers, poorer working conditions, lower salaries, fewer benefits, and reduced job satisfaction. We conclude that poorer conditions for the public service personnel are well documented as a short-term consequence of contracting out, while more studies covering a longer time-span are needed to assess whether the predominantly negative effects are transitory or will persist over time. © The Author(s) 2013.","contracting out; employee effects; public employees; systematic review; working conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961371753

The goal is to determine the types of early stage concepts that are developed, their potential performance impact on the existing business and their potential value to the organization ex ante decision making with respect to choice of projects to pursue. Design/methodology/approach – The authors apply a participatory case study approach combined with a content analysis of data from an idea management system that was utilized by the case organization. The authors build new empirically based theory on the direct and indirect value that emerges by creating new potential concepts to the innovation stream of an existing company. Findings – The authors conclude that three types of performance-improving activities are developed to be exploited during opportunity recognition and concept development, through a disciplined approach to uncovering potential RI projects. These concern existing products and production, as well as the conceptualization of new products to the organization, market and world. Practical implications – Approaching high uncertainty projects in a disciplined manner can be beneficial to an organization, since knowledge that is directly exploitable to improve performance is identified during the exploration process. Originality/value – The paper is original since the authors treat the study of innovation as an independent variable. The authors apply a theory-building approach based on empirical evidence that was collected in a real life setting and not in a business school setup. The findings are novel because the authors examine the potential value of radical innovation processes ex ante realization and decision making. Hence, the authors examine what happens before the archetypical performance measurements of realized innovation projects can be utilized to verdict the success or failure. ©Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Innovation; Performance criteria; Performance management; Radical innovation; Sustainable innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923377373

While sustainability connotes survival, excellence is the capacity to thrive across critical performance domains. Enter resilience and robustness. Resilience is enterprise ability to self-renew through innovation, changing and reinventing itself by adapting its responses to political, social, economic and other competitive shocks or challenges. Robustness is enterprise resistance or immunity gained through strategies, policies, partnerships, and practices that maintain or advance competitive position when shocks or challenges arise. Resistance as herein constructed is a composition or blend of revival, striving, surviving and thriving. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – A sustainable enterprise excellence, resilience and robustness (SEER2) model and assessment regime is proposed. SEER2 integrates excellence and sustainability principles, methodologies, and standards to optimize enterprise performance across the triple bottom line people, planet, and profit domains. Findings – A Springboard to SEER2 model blending simplicity, applicability, and usability by a range of enterprises is introduced. Its enablers include data analytics and intelligence, human ecology, and social-ecological innovation.

It explores the concept of “rural” as a socio-spatial concept in rural entrepreneurship and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between ideal types of rural entrepreneurship. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses concepts from human geography to develop two ideal types of entrepreneurship in rural areas. Ideal types constitute powerful heuristics for research and are used here to review and link existing literature on rural entrepreneurship and rural development as well as to develop new research avenues. Findings - Two ideal types are developed: first, entrepreneurship in the rural and second, rural entrepreneurship. The former represents entrepreneurial activities with limited embeddedness enacting a profit-oriented and mobile logic of space. The latter represents entrepreneurial activities that leverage local resources to re-connect place to space. While both types contribute to local development, the latter holds the potential for an optimized use of the resources in the rural area, and these ventures are unlikely to relocate even if economic rationality would suggest it. Research limitations/implications - The conceptual distinction allows for engaging more deeply with the diversity of entrepreneurial activities in rural areas. It increases our understanding of localized entrepreneurial processes and their impact on local economic development. Originality/value - This study contributes to the understanding of the localized processes of entrepreneurship and how these processes are enabled and constrained by the immediate context or “place”. The paper weaves space and place in order to show the importance of context for entrepreneurship, which responds to the recent calls for contextualizing entrepreneurship research and theories.

Exploring the workers' interpretations allows us to illustrate to what extent their employment situation constitutes a multi-dimensional liminal experience between established social structures and employment categories. The article emphasizes the complexity of the liminal experience. Theoretically and empirically, we show the many meanings along which liminality can unfold in organizational and work-related contexts. We argue that future studies should explore the various dimensions in other contexts of passages from one relatively stable state to another. In doing so, similarities and differences between various liminal experiences and the role the various dimensions play could be identified. © 2015 Roskilde University.","Denmark; Flexible employment; Liminality; Temporary agency work; Temporary work",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044552615

The emergence of new actors and issues has been addressed by those interested in studies of organizations through concepts and methods that highlight the importance of communities, fields, and networks. These approaches are important in identifying the sources of what becomes established, but less geared to identifying interactions that are emergent. This article extends a linked ecologies approach to emergence, arguing that interaction on transnational issues should first be understood by how they are conceptually linked by actors and organizations. A linked ecologies approach asks us to displace locating known actors within structures and instead pays attention to professional interactions on how 'issue distinctions' are made, the relationship between issue distinctions and professional tasks, and who and what are included and excluded. A linked ecologies approach provides a fruitful way of identifying actors and distinctions on issues that are emergent. These conceptual and methodological points are demonstrated through a study of how medical experts, demographers, and economists forge issue distinctions in relation to low fertility in advanced industrialized countries. © The Author(s) 2014.","Demographic change; Demography; Economics; Fertility; Gender; Issue distinctions; Linked ecologies; Medicine; Professions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946065109

As a commentary on this, we suggest looking at the gendered nature of the research text from the perspective of the technologies with which they are produced, as the writer - when writing/publishing - is always already embedded in the technologies of the publishing machine, turning (academic) writing into something akin to cyborg writing. We further suggest that an understanding of the cyborg nature of writing can introduce a parallel mode of inquiry, which holds the potential to enrich écriture féminine and stand as a critique of too simplistic readings of the same. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Cyborg writing; Feminine writing; Gender binaries; Gendered technologies; Writing technologies; Écriture féminine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84940295916

The cocreation of service within these service systems takes place in the context of a paradoxical tension between the logic of generative and democratic innovations and the logic of infrastructural control. Boundary resources play a critical role in managing the tension as a firm that owns the infrastructure can secure its control over the service system while independent firms can participate in the service system. In this study, we explore the evolution of boundary resources. Drawing on Pickering's (1993) and Barrett et al.'s (2012) conceptualizations of tuning, the paper seeks to forward our understanding of how heterogeneous actors engage in the tuning of boundary resources within Apple's iOS service system. We conduct an embedded case study of Apple's iOS service system with an in-depth analysis of 4,664 blog articles concerned with 30 boundary resources covering 6 distinct themes. Our analysis reveals that boundary resources of service systems enabled by digital technology are shaped and reshaped through distributed tuning, which involves cascading actions of accommodations and rejections of a network of heterogeneous actors and artifacts. Our study also shows the dualistic role of power in the distributed tuning process.","Boundary resource dynamics; Digital infrastructure; Ecosystem; IOS; Mobile platform; Service system innovation; Sociomateriality; Tuning","Ecosystems; Fruits; Tuning; Digital infrastructures; IOS; Mobile platform; Resource dynamics; Service systems; Socio materialities; iOS (operating system)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939781260

(1997) demonstrated that sophisticated residual income-based figures are not as superior to traditional accounting-based performance measures in tracking shareholder value as consulting firms have claimed. During these 17 years, the intensive discussion of which type of measure tracks shareholder value creation the best continued, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. This article compares the new findings from advanced research between 1997 and 2014 to assess the ongoing validity of Biddle et al.’s (1997) conclusions. We separate articles into two groups: the ones that find accounting-based performance measure to perform best, and the ones who speak in favor of residual income-based performance measures. In order to do this, we have scanned 618 articles that relate to the findings of Biddle et al. (1997) and analyze the 21 articles that actually contributed new evidence. We find that the conceptual discussion still favors management control systems based on the more sophisticated residual income-based measures. Yet empirically, the vast majority of new studies with advanced research designs still find that accounting numbers are by no means inferior in measuring shareholder value creation. © 2015, Virtus Interpress.

The longevity bond is a bond specifying payments, which are linked to the current number of survivors in a given portfolio of insured lives. The number of survivors is modeled via a double-stochastic process, where the mortality intensity is driven by a time-inhomogeneous Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model. In addition to the longevity bond, the financial market is assumed to consist of a traditional bond and a savings account. We define the price process of the longevity bond by introducing a pricing measure. The paper extends previous work in the literature to the case where the traded assets are not martingales under the measure used for determining the optimal strategies.

Our work focuses on students with a non-native English-language background in a business school setting. Although proponents argue that EMI generally increases graduates' employability, they do not sufficiently consider that study strategies differ substantially across social milieus and between the sexes. Failing to account for cultural distance of students to the educational system in choosing EMI can foster social inequality and contribute to the reproduction of elites. Using a survey, we conduct a quasi-experiment in two identical bachelor's degree programs that differ only in their instruction language. Using structural equation modeling, we find that students from higher social strata are much more likely to choose EMI. As suggested by the Bourdieusian perspective, this relationship is not directly observable but operates through hidden mechanisms, such as cultural capital (relative English proficiency) and a better sense of gaming and positioning (career orientation). Business students from the lowest stratum self-select against EMI due to a pronounced fear of failure despite their awareness that EMI leads to higher employability. Our findings support the successful introduction of EMI while ensuring social equality. Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926666490

We find that the auditor’s identification with the client firm and the auditor’s confidence in the client management are highly relevant to the level of qualitative change perceived by the client, while previously used indicators of auditor expertise (e.g. audit firm size, level of non-audit services) do not reveal a significant effect.

The research demonstrates the efficacy of the new approach as a lens and methodological framework to advance process-driven explanations and research in IE.

Results of this study, however, suggest that organizations may only be able to leverage these advantages if they have a supporting management structure.

But, there is need to understand the leader-follower behaviour of firms with differentiated products. The classical game theoretic models do not consider bounds on prices. Hence, applying these models for product choice and pricing decisions in a real-life industrial setting may result in infeasible product choices and generate misleading results. To overcome this gap between theory and practice, we develop game theoretic models for sequential decision making by two firms using reservation price as upper bound on prices by formulating it as a quadratic programming problem.

The analysis shows that the management accounting discourse becomes the dominating ideology which is embedded in the public rhetorical debate. There are three peculiar outcomes of this domination; the absence of physicians in the general public debate, the creation of a phantom phenomenon meaning that the negative consequences of the reform are blamed on a third person, typically the system, and finally a changing meaning of the health care service quality provided from a medical perspective of a patient oriented focus to a quantitative focus through strong rationalised arguments. This puts the medical profession in a dilemma concerning their ideological Hippocratic Oath versus the NPM efficiency focus.

A univariate quantile regression model is used to examine the marginal stock and bond return distributions, while a multivariate model is used to capture their joint distribution. An empirical analysis on US data shows that economic state variables predict the stock and bond return distributions in quite different ways in terms of, for example, location shifts, volatility and skewness. Comparing the different economic state variables in terms of their out-of-sample forecasting performance, the empirical analysis also shows that the relative accuracy of the state variables varies across the return distribution.

The aim of the article is to shed light on the barriers, which hinder collaboration, and to investigate the particular role of research and technology organizations (RTOs) as potential mediators of collaboration between SMEs and universities. On the basis of a unique sample consisting of 151 SMEs, RTOs and universities from seven countries, the differences across dyads of potential collaborations are identified. In particular, the article finds that both firms and universities with collaboration experience with the other partner in general perceive higher barriers than inexperienced firms or universities. In terms of the mediating role of RTOs, the article illustrates that universities perceive lower barriers when collaborating with RTOs than with SMEs. A similar tendency to a mediating role of RTOs can be found among the SMEs' perception of university collaboration. Finally, the analysis shows that the knowledge institutions perceive the SMEs as very important collaboration partners, but the same sense of importance is not shared by the SMEs regarding collaboration with the knowledge institutions. Hence, there seems to be a quite unbalanced view on the potential of the collaborative ties, which is further discussed in the conclusion.

The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual model for understanding how health authorities and marketers can affect consumption of healthy food - and ultimately body mass index (BMI) - by addressing perceptual antecedents of consumers' involvement and health competencies. A qualitative (n=16) pilot study and a consumer panel survey (n=599) assisted in completing this task. The obtained structural equation modelling results confirmed that increasing consumers' competencies concerning healthy food consumption may improve the healthiness of their food behaviour, and ultimately reduce their BMI. Notably, these effects may occur even for consumers who perceive healthy food consumption to be a challenge. Our results also revealed that it may be problematic to improve health competencies for food consumers who are less involved in healthy food consumption. However, our study shows that two perceptual factors, 'personal food identity' (the extent to which consumers believe that their health identity is linked to their food behaviour) and 'unhealthy food taste belief' (the extent to which consumers believe that unhealthy food is more enjoyable and tastier than healthy food), may assist health authorities and marketers in increasing consumers' involvement in healthy food consumption. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","BMI; Competencies; Food; Identity; Involvement; Taste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923032644

This paper explores this paradox by focusing on a previously under-researched group of consumers - 'sustainable fashion consumption pioneers' who actively engage and shape their own discourse around the notion of sustainable fashion consumption. These pioneers actively create and communicate strategies for sustainable fashion behaviour that can overcome the nebulous and somewhat paradoxical reality that sustainable development in the fashion industry presents. Specifically, we use passive netnography and semi-structured interviews to illuminate the role of motivational and contextual factors that help shape these consumers' definitions of sustainable fashion including such key behaviours as purchasing fewer garments of higher quality, exiting the retail market, purchasing only second-hand fashion goods and sewing or upgrading their own clothing. Central to much of these behaviours is the notion that personal style, rather than fashion, can bridge the potential disconnect between sustainability and fashion while also facilitating a sense of well-being not found in traditional fashion consumption. As such, our research suggests that for these consumers sustainability is as much about reducing measurable environmental or social impacts as it is about incorporating broader concepts through which to achieve goals beyond the pro-environmental or ethical. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Fashion consumption; Second-hand/DIY consumption; Style versus fashion; Sustainable fashion; Sustainable fashion pioneers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923019326

Studies show that the way in which employees actually work, their practices, influences the implementation of formal elements. Based on a case study, the practices of the purchasers in seven subsidiaries of a Nordic electricity producing company are analyzed. The analysis addresses the changes in practices due to changing the green procurement procedures of the company. The subsidiaries have similar procedures and policies but different procurement practices. The case is focused on the procurement of minor items; all products that are not directly transformed into the product produced by the company, for example cleaning detergents and office supplies. Previous studies have shown that the procurement of minor items is less likely to be influenced by external actors as there is a limited supply chain focus on these products. For the individual company, the minor items might not have a significant environmental impact, but this type of product is bought by most companies and organizations and thereby the total amount adds up. A theoretical approach of organizational learning and practice is applied to understand the occurrence of these differences and also to highlight new perspectives on the challenges in establishing green procurement in organizations. The analysis shows that changes in the purchasers' practices are not as much dependent on whether they understand, e.g., policies, tools and procedures, but rather a matter of whether the purchasers actually put their knowledge into practice. Green procurement is a habit that forms part of everyday practice and not something that the purchasers deal with separately; it cannot be seen as a separate form of knowledge. Therefore green procurement needs to be adjusted to the existing procurement practices. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Green procurement; Learning; Minor items; Practice","Environmental protection; Soaps (detergents); Supply chains; Environmental efforts; Environmental policy; Green procurement; Learning; Minor items; Organizational learning; Practice; Procurement practices; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922991622

Building on a mixed-method investigation through two studies within an online gardening community, findings reveal two specific consumptive moments, direct and vicarious, and their differential role in the creation of community engagement and vitality. These findings suggest that lurking is not adequately described as a unidimensional construct, but is best understood as vicarious consumptive moments of specific online community practices with distinctive value outcomes.

In the pharmaceutical sector, product launch operations are of particular importance, as companies seek to reduce time-to-market to better exploit patent protection. Large volumes of product need to be ready to fill the downstream supply chain immediately at market launch. Building up the required inventory is, however, connected to several risks. In addition to the risk associated with the lack of demand information for a new product, there are several risks unique to the pharmaceutical sector. After approval by central authorities such as the FDA or EMA, a new drug still needs to receive market authorization, which is in most cases granted by some local authorities - in Europe, for example, by more than 30 national and regional bodies. The duration of these different market authorization processes as well as their outcomes (e.g. price and reimbursement levels, requirements of label or leaflet changes) are highly uncertain. We develop a two-stage stochastic model to support market launch preparation decisions. It trades off the costs of accepting these risks, for example by risk packaging before authorization, against the lost revenue caused by risk-averse operations. The model is applied to a case based on an empirical study. Our approach results in significant savings compared to current practices. We hereby provide an example of how quantitative methodology can provide valuable decision support for product launch operations, even when complex regulatory affairs need to be considered. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, many new products require a complementary product to operate. In such markets, releasing a technologically sophisticated product involves a trade-off as it excludes consumers whose complementary products no longer function with the core product. Firms therefore have to balance product quality against market size. Technological change brings a dynamic perspective to this trade-off as it renders existing technology obsolete but also increases performance of the complementary products, therefore increasing market potential. We study these mechanisms in the empirical context of computer games. In line with our expectations, we find an inverted U-shaped relationship between closeness to the technological frontier and sales revenues as well as differential effects of technological change depending on initial technological quality. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We provide a new explanation for this phenomenon, based on markets for technology. It applies in industries where successful entrepreneurial firms, or their technologies, are acquired by incumbents that then commercialize the innovation. To this end we analyze an innovation game between one incumbent and a large number of entrants. In the first stage, firms compete to develop innovations of high quality. They do so by choosing, at equal cost, the success probability of their R&D approach, where a lower probability accompanies higher value in case of success - that is, a more radical innovation. In the second stage, successful entrants bid to be acquired by the incumbent. We assume that entrants cannot survive on their own, so being acquired amounts to a prize in a contest. We identify an equilibrium in which the incumbent performs the least radical project. Entrants pick pairwise different projects; the bigger the number of entrants, the more radical the most radical project. Generally, entrants tend to choose more radical R&D approaches and generate the highest value innovation in case of success. We illustrate our theoretical findings by a qualitative empirical study of the Electronic Design Automation industry, and derive implications for research and management. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we propose a framework to describe six possible combinations of innovation and demand/consumption levels that constitute in turn six narratives of sustainability. We argue that the present global trend is set out for a dominant narrative, what we call 'Green Growth', which is rooted in the idea that economic growth - and thus technological change - is a prerequisite for environmental sustainability. By way of example, we use the case of the lighting industry to show that this narrative cannot assure an absolute reduction of the present levels of energy consumption. We therefore propose to embrace a different narrative of sustainability that encourages at the same time the development of eco-efficient technologies and the reduction of demand/consumption. This alternative narrative is linked to the development of the concept of '. useful light' and to a paradigm change in which the lighting sector is no longer framed around the electric bulb. This transition would require a new class of Lighting Service Companies (LISCO) and of new functional business models based on the sale of 'useful light'. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Eco-innovation; Green business models; Green growth; Lighting industry; Narratives analysis; Rebound effect; Sustainability","Economic analysis; Energy utilization; Lighting; Eco-innovation; Green business; Green growths; Lighting industry; Narratives analysis; Rebound effect; Sustainable development; economic growth; industry; innovation; light; sustainability; sustainable development; technological change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916934568

However, critics of communicative rationality and its underlying assumptions raise fundamental questions about the very possibility of an actually existing collaborative planning process. While collaborative planning theory provides a worthwhile ideal, the assumptions of bracketing status difference, identifying common good and building consensus, problematize its application in real life. In fact, collaborative planning principles provide a means for the market-driven local state and planning agencies to reinforce present neoliberal hegemony. While such processes may result in community empowerment and greater democracy under certain conditions, market-led planning projects are more likely to co-opt the high democratic principles of collaborative/communicative planning theory and nurture a post-political condition. This paper elaborates these points by examining the planning process of the Atlanta BeltLine as an instance of neoliberal governance. Using qualitative research methods this paper analyzes the BeltLine's community engagement effort to democratize the planning process in the Historic Fourth Ward neighborhood in Atlanta. It argues that BeltLine-like market-led planning efforts tactfully take advantage of the problematic principles of collaborative planning theory to create an ostensibly democratic decision-making process that in reality reinforces the neoliberal hegemony instead of challenging it. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Atlanta BeltLine; Collaborative governance and planning; Democracy; Neoliberalism; Post-political","democracy; empowerment; governance approach; hegemony; neighborhood; neoliberalism; planning process; urban planning; Atlanta; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84916911958

The paper examines a select number of self-styled conceptual alternatives from the literature on public management to what has been the dominant paradigm in recent years, the New Public Management (NPM). “Self-styled” means that they explicitly present themselves as alternatives to NPM and address the shortcomings in NPM to promote alternative conceptualizations. They include Digital-Era Governance, Public Value Management (PVM), Collaborative Governance, also known to some as the New Public Governance (NPG). The paper takes each of these as broad categories, and proposes that each shelters sub-categories of ideas. DEG: transparency, social media and shared service centers. PVM: strategy-making, performance governance, and innovation and strategic HRM. NPG: networks and collaboration, public-private partnerships and new ways of engaging active citizens. The paper sees these ideas as competing for dominance in the public organization literature as they are new drivers for reforms. Together they form the building blocks of how public management reforms can be build. The paper also recognizes that there are disagreements between them.

These contributions include the first publication and description of the term “stakeholder”, the first stakeholder map, and the development of three fundamental tenets of stakeholder theory: jointness of interests, cooperative strategic posture, and rejection of a narrowly economic view of the firm. We then explore the current practices of Scandinavian companies through which we identify the evidence of relationships to these historical contributions. Thus, we propose that Scandinavia offers a particularly promising context from which to draw inspiration regarding effective company-stakeholder cooperation and where ample of examples of what is more recently referred to as “creating shared value” can be found. We conclude by endorsing the expression “Scandinavian cooperative advantage” in an effort to draw attention to the Scandinavian context and encourage the field of strategic management to shift its focus from achieving a competitive advantage toward achieving a cooperative advantage. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cooperative advantage; Creating shared value; Scandinavia; Stakeholder theory; Strategic management; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880927473

We argue that government has played a pivotal role in making this happen, and that this reflects strong traditions of regulation, corporatism and active state involvement. However, there is no unitary “Danish model of CSR” being promoted by government. Although Danish society is often associated with a model of consensus, our claim is that Danish government policy on CSR is characterized by a lack of common direction and that we need to approach it on such terms. In order to provide a critical account of ‘the Danish model’ we apply a governmentality perspective that allows us to stress political difference. We argue that Danish government policy consists of three distinct regimes of practice and show how they subject CSR to different modes of rationalization and action. We conclude that the problem with public policy being split into three is not different as such, but the failure of each regime to recognize the value of the others.

How does this relationship change when we enlarge our focus from individual firms to industries and nations? This articles examines the dominance of Danish bacon in Britain between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. We argue that this supremacy required state intervention and cooperation between government and producers to underpin high and consistent levels of quality throughout the supply chain, both of which were necessary to ensure the successful marketing of ""Danish"" bacon. In Britain, by contrast, state intervention to increase bacon production was only partially successful because it was undermined by a nineteenth-century legacy of uncoordination and deregulation. Such weaknesses affected the supply of appropriate pigs and the production of bacon that was uniform in quality, and ultimately negated the efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to promote a ""British"" bacon brand. © The Author 2015.

We argue on theoretical grounds that the same organizational designs support the realization as well as the discovery of opportunities. Specifically, decentralized structures are associated with opportunity realization as well discovery, and this effect is reinforced by formalization. Decentralization gives managers the discretion and autonomy needed to recognize and realize opportunities, while formalization enables the standardization and codification of actions and processes. To test these ideas, we use a data-set based on paired responses from 474 Danish firms operating in several industries for our analyses. We find that decentralization and formalization have direct, positive, and significant associations with opportunity realization. We also address how these organizational design variables are related to opportunity discovery. We find similar effects. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our reasoning and results, such as implications for the idea in the innovation and organizational learning literatures that optimal performance over time requires that firms either vacillate between organizational designs or adopt ambidextrous designs. © The Author(s) 2014.","Design and boundaries; entrepreneurship; firm performance; innovation management; organizational structure; regression analysis; research methods; topics and perspectives",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921395694

The jury on the studio phenomenon is out—can they deliver on their educational promise? To address this question, we pull together 25 years of studio experimentation in multiple settings, visits, and observations of studios around the world and interviews with studio makers from various disciplines. We consider the question of “what is a business studio?” in some detail, conjecture about the value that studios might have for management education, provide examples of four different business studio orientations and how these might translate into practice, and highlight what we believe to be some essentials when starting and running a business studio. © The Author(s) 2014.","design and business; experiential learning; management studies; problem-based learning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921285939

The present study is carried out in order to contribute to the development of a clearer understanding of active facilitation of innovation management and FEI in theory and in practice across international borders. I aim to show how different aspects of Pharma and nationality affect the way innovation management and radical FEI are supported within organisations. This is examined through an in-depth case study of the Danish and US based pharmaceutical company, H. Lundbeck A/S, and a comparative study including five European and American pharmaceutical companies. The findings from the study reveal a number of similarities and differences in innovation management and FEI support of radical projects and among the different nationalities. This presents propositions of important aspects to consider in facilitation of radical FEI in general and in multinational pharmaceutical companies. In addition, proposals are made for a global study of innovation management and FEI support including Chinese and other Asian pharmaceutical companies, which represent a growing market. The value added and the contribution of this paper to the existing FEI literature is therefore in the specificity of the empirical setting in which the issue is investigated. © 2015 Imperial College Press.","case study; Front end innovation; innovation management; pharmaceutical innovation; radical innovation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929380183

We theorize temporal experiences as an effect of performing consumption practices in order to move from assessing isolated contextual variables to a more holistic understanding. The timeflow of a practice is defined as its ability to evoke an experienced temporality that cannot be reduced to either subjective “inner” time or cosmic “outer” time. On the basis of a longitudinal ethnography of temporality in two lifestyle sports—freeskiing and paintball—we find that five practice elements shape temporal experience: material set-up, bodily routines and skills, teleoaffective structures, rules, and cultural understandings. Misalignments of practice elements induce experiences of temporal drag or rush associated with experiences such as boredom and stress.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the energy consumption patterns of tomato production, corresponding GHG emissions, and relationships between inputs and output by a Cobb-Douglass econometric model. The changes in GHG emissions were also investigated to display if the result is in favor of the environment as well as economy. The non-hierarchical cluster analysis determined three groups of tomato farmers with respect to the energy inputs and tomato yield; C1, C2 and C3 including 90, 46 and 20 farmers, respectively. The findings showed that around 40-60 GJ/ha energy is needed to produce 54-70 ton/ha tomato. Although, the C1 farmers consumed around 20 GJ/ha higher energy than C3, they also had a higher output-input energy ratio; 1.15 and 1.12, respectively. The GHG emission index (IGHG) disclosed that energy efficiency indices cannot represent the environmental risks of energy inputs since some higher energy efficient groups also emitted higher carbon. The econometric analysis revealed that some energy inputs significantly correlates with the yields of C1 and C2 farmers. The highest marginal physical productivities (MPPs), however, indicated that tomato yield is most sensitive to machinery and chemicals energy inputs in the C1 and C2, respectively, which should be considered first to increase in order to achieve productivity enhancement. The result displayed that higher energy consumption according to the econometric models and MPPs may lead to much higher CO2 emissions compared to the current average emissions particularly when MPP is low. Hence, it is suggested that production types with the highest MPPs should be considered if change in energy inputs is desired. In addition, it is recommended that ""green econometric"" models are needed to evaluate balanced energy use consumption together with other agronomical, economical and the environmental sustainability impact assessment criteria. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study draws on a promotions benefits framework to examine the influence of shoppers’ desired benefits on their relative proneness to in-store monetary and non-monetary promotions. Computer-aided telephone interviewing (CATI) data gathered from 500 grocery shoppers are used. The findings show that shoppers who are prone to using non-monetary in-store promotions seek exploration, entertainment and value expression benefits, in common with shoppers who are prone to monetary promotions. Both monetary and non-monetary promotion-prone shoppers feel financially constrained. In addition, non-monetary promotion-prone shoppers enjoy gambling and other hedonic outcomes. The managerial implications of our research findings are that many monetary sales promotion-prone shoppers may be attracted by the benefits provided by non-monetary promotions. The increased use by managers of non-monetary promotions instead of monetary promotions may result in improved category value and brand equity benefits. © 2014, Westburn Publishers Ltd.","benefits; CATI; mavenism; non-monetary; proneness; sales promotion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926142829

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected using an extended version of the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP2) Group’s instrument. Pre-qualified managers largely self-completed the survey. Model associations were tested via regression and causal path analysis. Findings – Various aspects of commitment play differing roles in relationship development. The role of commitment was less than expected; the exception is value-based commitment which is strongly associated with value creation, conflict management, trust and cooperation. Research limitations/implications – Findings provide explanations for some inconsistencies in previous findings including reported relationships between trust, cooperation and commitment. The composition of the commitment construct(s) strongly influences relationship processes. Practical implications – There are various kinds of commitment to build and multiple pathways to levering this into more effective relationships. In addition, an important part of these findings is strong indications that illustrate what the nature of ineffective commitment-building paths is likely to be. This is extremely important for managers in guiding deployment of relationship management resources and developing relationship management practice. Social implications – The regulation of close business-to-business relationships remains an important issue, and the ways in which commitment can be appropriately extended are an important part of this. Originality/value – This work focuses on the components of commitment in ways that previous work has not. The centrality of commitment in relationship value creation – beyond increased sales and revenue and predictability – is highlighted, and there is considerable extension to the understanding of the nature of this process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Buyer–seller relationships; Commitment; Cooperative advantage; Relationship value",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938485128

Design/methodology/approach – The authors offer a critical analysis and discussion of recent publications in order to explore the nexus of “public”, “culture” and “global”, questioning whether the increased interest in a specific understanding of culture actually contributes to the field’s ability to deal with complex and transforming publics in a meaningful manner. Findings – The majority of global public relations literature applies redundant understandings of globalization. It attaches prime importance to the concept of culture and contributes little to the understanding of transforming publics. Few scholars acknowledge the limitations of using “culture” for the definition of publics in global contexts. Alternative approaches to understanding “publics” in global public relations research and practice are hardly offered. Research limitations/implications – The findings imply that global public relations research would benefit from abandoning monolithic social science categories and from working transdisciplinary in order to refine its understanding of contemporary societal and social transformations and their implications for the understanding of public and relationship building. Practical implications – The discussion indicates that public relations practitioners could benefit from reorienting their understanding of publics in globalizing societies in order to build and nourish mutually beneficial relationships. The authors apply the insight into contemporary business practices to offer public relations practitioners a starting point for reorientation.

However, sponsorships of daily newspapers’ major editorial content sections have not been implemented yet because editors primarily suspect negative effects on the perceived journalistic quality of the newspaper’s reporting. Thus, editors seem to be in a dilemma since the realization of additional sponsorship funding might come at the cost of negative consumer reactions. Against this background, this study for the first time analyses consumer reactions to sponsorships of major editorial content sections in daily print newspapers. The results of three experimental studies show that editorial content sponsorships deteriorate consumers’ attitudes toward the newspaper by decreasing the perceived journalistic quality of the newspapers’ reporting. However, we identify relevant boundary conditions under which these negative effects disappear. Specifically, sponsorships of low thematic congruence between the sponsor’s business activity and the editorial content which are placed in editorial content sections with low societal relevance (i.e., sections which provide editorial content of low relevance for societal and political decision making) seem to be a promising configuration from a newspaper’s as well as a sponsor’s perspective. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Editorial content sponsorships; Journalistic quality; Media management; Societal relevance; Thematic congruence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963546729

The analysis suggests that audiences' general principles regarding paying for online news influence their willingness to pay more than the size of the subscription fee. Furthermore, the analysis shows that younger audiences' willingness to pay increases if they can combine content from different news providers and thereby individualise their news products.

Our case study of an IT PPP reveals public- and private-side differences that initially impeded the establishment of a partnership; using institutional logics theory as meta-theoretical lens, we propose a model that explains how public and private parties managed to negotiate their mode of collaboration by balancing their competing institutional norms and practices which ultimately resulted in the convergence of the two divergent logics. Our paper contributes to theory and practice by (1) elucidating the theoretical foundations and role of institutional logics for IT project management that we found dominated by public and private norms and practices, (2) explaining why collaboration in IT PPPs is so difficult, and (3) how eventually an IT PPP can be established.

Our research objectives were to (1) analyze and present the spatial results of the mapping method as a benchmark for future research, (2) compare mapped place attachment to the more common practice of mapping landscape values in PPGIS that comprise a values home range, (3) identify how participant socio-demographic and home location attributes influence place attachment, (4) provide some guidance for mapping place attachment in future research. We found large spatial variability in individual place attachment and mapped landscape values using both area and distance-based measures. The area of place attachment is influenced by occupational roles such as farming or conservation, as well as home location, especially in coastal versus non-coastal contexts. The spatial distribution of mapped landscape values or values home range is related to, but not identical to mapped place attachment with just over half of landscape values located outside the area of mapped place attachment. Economic livelihood values, as an indicator of place dependence, and social values, as an indicator of place identity, are more likely to be mapped within the place attachment area. Aggregated place attachment across participants in the region showed similar spatial intensity to aggregated values home range, but area-based assessment of place attachment and values home range are distorted by edge effects such as a coastline.

Here, expatriate and local managers tried to give sense to the Winning Behaviours in various ways, and employees brought their own local leadership ideals into play when they tried to make sense of the preferred behaviours and turn them into daily practices. The process of creating a new strategic concept and making it live in other sociocultural contexts was facilitated by headquarters staff in the Human Resources and Communications departments, who thus played an important role as change agents in the ‘glocal’ strategy process. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Corporate values; Recontextualisation; Sensegiving; Strategic change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902709055

The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc., with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real- or near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems of a living being operate and respond to their environment (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the formation of 'smart(er) communities' that are socially connected in new ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the 'brain drain' from the countryside and smaller towns to larger metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions. © Kamel Boulos et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Digital inclusion; Distributed city model; Innovation; Internet of things; Smart cities; Smart countryside; Social care; Well-being Europe; WHO healthy cities","Animalia; benchmarking; environmental monitoring; Europe; health; Internet; organization; quality of life; world health organization; Benchmarking; Congresses as Topic; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Internet; Quality of Life; Urban Health; World Health Organization",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928729928

In many studies, missing data occur and a popular tool for handling missing data is multiple imputation. The objective of this study was to investigate how the estimated range of influence is affected when 1) the outcome is only observed at some of a given set of locations, and 2) multiple imputation is used to impute the outcome at the non-observed locations. Methods: The study was based on the simulation of missing outcomes in a complete data set. The range of influence was estimated from a logistic regression model with a spatially structured random effect, modelled by a Gaussian field. Results were evaluated by comparing estimates obtained from complete, missing, and imputed data. Results: In most simulation scenarios, the range estimates were consistent with ≤ 25% missing data. In some scenarios, however, the range estimate was affected by even a moderate number of missing observations. Multiple imputation provided a potential improvement in the range estimate with ≥ 50% missing data, but also increased the uncertainty of the estimate. Conclusions: The effect of missing observations on the estimated range of influence depended to some extent on the missing data mechanism. In general, the overall effect of missing observations was small compared to the uncertainty of the range estimate. © 2015 Bihrmann and Ersbøll.","Binary data; INLA; Missing data; Range of influence","Gaussian method; numerical model; regression analysis; spatial data; uncertainty analysis; computer simulation; methodology; statistical analysis; statistics and numerical data; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Research Design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924352982

The chapter suggests that the complementarity of presential and referential transactions and the link between Territorial economic transaction (TET)s and usual industry opens new ways to think about territorial development in a time when the mobility of people and information increases continuously and consequently when sociocultural value becomes an increasing component of economic value. In economic systems dominated by self-production and self-consumption, like a family, there is no need for an abstraction like a price because those systems are based exclusively on the use-value associated with cultural meaning. In such socio-economic organizations, there is no money, no clear distinction between producers and consumers and valuation processes take place in the frame of the community. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137428265

In order to address this issue, we have conducted an empirical investigation examining the CSR reports of some of the world’s largest companies. Based on the data, we argue that CSR reporting does not enable stakeholders to evaluate the CSR commitment of companies. The main problem is that companies do not present or defend sufficiently clear baselines, i.e. stakeholders are mostly kept in the dark when it comes to the level of a company’s social and environmental obligations. In addition, the variety of different values, e.g., marginal groups in the workforce, and reducing CO2 emissions, makes CSR reports very hard to evaluate.

The evaluation framework is based on three lines of argument. First we argue that CSR reporting ideally ought to enable the stakeholders to evaluate a company’s CSR commitment in four different ways, including cross-sector comparison. Second, we argue that CSR concerns – or ought to concern – the ethical responsibilities of companies, implying that CSR reports should be evaluated on the basis of their ability to provide a fair and reasonably transparent sketch of the ethical behaviour of a given company. Third, we argue in favour of a specific normative framework for evaluating the current practice of CSR reporting. Finally, we use the normative framework to sketch the contours of a framework for evaluating the quality of CSR reports. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Cardinal Measure; Ethical Framework; Ethical Responsibility; Harmful Action; Moral Agent",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130867158

If such a challenge is taken seriously, competitive advantage has to be achieved through a kind of superiority which consumers are both able and willing to demand. Seen from a marketing management point of view buyers should therefore always preferably perceive that the expected value of the firm’s offerings exceeds the expected value of any alternative supplied by a competitor. It is therefore hardly surprising that some of the more recent contributions originating from consumer research reflect a growing interest in examining different aspects of customer value, but these studies have not yet resulted in unambiguous interpretations neither of what these aspects in fact represent, nor of their normative implications for marketing strategy. It has therefore been considered as worthwhile to explore in further detail some salient dimensions of customer value which are supposed to be decisive for firms trying to create and maintain sustainable relationships with their customers in consumer markets. This will be done by first characterizing the interrelationship between customer value and sustainable competitive advantage. Then some salient antecedents and consequences of customer value are examined by highlighting the importance of post purchase experience or expectations of consumer value for prepurchase judgements of customer value. Finally some suggestions are outlined for firms trying to create and maintain sustainable relationships with their customers by making superior contributions to the consumers’ value-producing behaviours. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.","Consumer Market; Consumer Research; Market Orientation; Marketing Strategy; Sustainable Competitive Advantage",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125767781

We open up the black box of market-sensing capabilities by treating the issue of choosing marketing attributes of products as a problem of organizational search. Despite much robust research on organizational search in the strategy and organization literature (Cyert & March, 1963; Nelson & Winter, 1982; March, 1988; Levinthal, 1997; Sorenson, 2002), the organizational search processes underlying market orientation has received little, if any, attention in marketing research.

While tourism accommodation is usually either commercial (hotels, hostels, holiday apartments, camping sites, etc.) or non-commercial (staying with friends and family, Couchsurfing, HomeExchange, etc.), Airbnb is a platform for sharing space that portrays itself as commercial and noncommercial at the same time. Arguably, Airbnb simultaneously allows for commercial exchange, for human relations between hosts and guests and for contributing to a potentially great experience. Through this perspective, Airbnb has been portrayed as a company belonging to the so-called sharing economy (Gansky 2010; Botsman and Rogers 2010), an economy that is based on consumers engaging directly with each other. Airbnb can also be perceived to be part of the experience economy (Pine and Gilmore 1999; Prahalad and Ramaswamy 2004; Boswijk et al. 2007) with Airbnb’s strong focus on delivering what Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s Chief Executive Officer, terms as ‘the perfect experience’ (Fast Company 2012). Thus, Airbnb seems to be an exemplary phenomenon of ongoing transitions within tourism. These transitions are mainly driven by how consumers, the tourists, want to experience a destination. Maitland (2010) has analysed tourists’ motivations for experiencing everyday life in the city and found that some tourists are attracted by places that are not touristy, out of the way, less crowded, etc. Maitland (2010: 176) observes that city tourism ‘can no longer be simply seen as a separate activity, focused on well-defined tourism precincts, where comparatively passive visitors consume carefully designed tourism products’. Similarly, Larsen (2008: 179) has argued that the dualism between tourism and everyday life does not apply since ‘experienced travellers may find the exotic in the everyday, in the real life of the city to be found off the beaten track’. Boswijk et al. (2007) argue how the experience economy has developed towards a more consumer-oriented version compared to the first generation introduced by Pine and Gilmore (1999), which had a strong focus on the company’s role in staging and delivering experiences. It is the understanding of this transition towards a more user-oriented approach to experiences that the present chapter wants to contribute to with a study of Airbnb hosts and guests. More specifically, the focus of the chapter is on getting an in-depth understanding of how the Airbnb experience unfolds. The underlying expectations for ‘the Airbnb experience’ and its relations to the experience economy and the sharing economy are central to this understanding. The chapter seeks this understanding through an interview-based study of Airbnb hosts and guests in Copenhagen. Here, I have aimed to get close to understanding the spatial, relational and experiential implications of using Airbnb. For this inquiry, I use the concept of in-betweenness, inspired by authors such as Löfgren (2008), Edensor (1998), Bærenholdt et al. (2004) and Larsen (2008). In-betweenness is used in three different meanings. Experiential in-betweenness gives a perspective on the ambiguous ways of experiencing, with guests being tourists and locals at the same time. Relational in-betweenness offers a perspective on the ambiguous relations between hosts and guests. Spatial in-betweenness gives a concept for the places that are in-between the defined and designed tourist places: places that are not developed for tourism, but attract tourists looking for experiences. As such, the current chapter is inspired by and draws upon ideas of analysing and understanding experiences as performative, as doings, not as fixed or given (Bærenholdt et al. 2004; Larsen 2008; Urry and Larsen 2011). I do this by empirically testing some of the dualisms associated with the tourist experience and with the Airbnb experience, such as everyday vs tourism (e.g. Larsen 2008) and must-see attractions vs off-the-beaten-track (e.g. Judd 1999). In this sense, the chapter contrasts the ‘stereotypical’ Airbnb experience with the actual Airbnb experiences by hosts and guests. Based on the Airbnb experiences by guests and hosts, the chapter calls for a more ambiguous and multi-dimensional understanding of how experiences unfold. The chapter sets out to investigate how Airbnb affects the spatial, relational and experiential aspects of tourists visiting a destination, and how the users evaluate their experience of using Airbnb. I introduce Airbnb and analyse it through notions of the experience economy and the sharing economy and compare these perspectives with those found in existing research on Airbnb. Then follows a brief introduction to the term of ‘in-betweenness’ before applying the concept to my analysis of the Airbnb experience by hosts and guests. I end up by discussing the implications of this study for tourism planning. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108944865

It takes the position that the development of tourism within a sustainability framework requires that tourism professionals effectively engage in dynamic social discourses where difficult trade-offs are made between competing demands. The challenge for tourism education is therefore to prepare graduates to work in these complex, value-laden, socio-political environments where they can proactively and positively contribute to developing forms of tourism that progress the objectives of sustainable development. This chapter explores this challenge in terms of a philosophic tourism practitioner education, and in doing so, discusses three key dimensions of this education: historical antecedents and contemporary knowledge and understandings of governance; competencies for tourism governance for sustainability; and ethical action-oriented practice. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Education; Governance; Philosophic practitioner; Ship of the state; Sustainability; Tourism",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108762518

In this chapter, the new Marxist challenge to CSR as a meaningful, coherent concept and practice is discussed. In the wake of the financial crisis the critique from the Marxist-inspired left tends to replace the scepticism of the libertarian right (Friedman 1970). The legitimacy of business in society is at stake, and the critical left is well placed to debunk the integrity of business’s claim to social responsibility. To provide an overview of current Marxist inspired CSR thinking, this chapter introduces the Hegelian inspired critique of a New Spirit of Capitalism (Chiapello 2013) as well as the critique of ideology targeted at the neo-liberal project of corporate responsibility (Žižek 2008; Fleming and Jones 2013). Subsequently, two possible liberal ‘revisions’ to the Marxist inspired scepticism of CSR are presented and discussed: first, the theory of a social connection model (Young 2006), and then the theory of deliberative democracy and political CSR (Scherer and Palazzo 2011).

These events have had significant adverse effects on corporate value creation and societal wealth causing major disruptions to the quality of life of the people that inhabit the exposed economies. Hence, there should be little wonder that both political and business leaders have paid great tribute to these events with steadfast aims of imposing policies, rules, and regulations that would prevent something similar from happening again. However, as we know, it is human nature to do too much when it is too late, and too little when it is time to act. Hence, in hindsight executives and policy makers should act on early sightings of evolving changes that everybody nonetheless seems to ignore despite the warning signals for all to see. As argued by Harrison and Phillips (2014: p. 164): “it was apparent from the serious economic journalism of 2006, 2007 and early 2008 that there were many ‘canaries in the cave’ that anticipated the landscape of the financial crisis of 2008.” In other words, there is a tendency to ignore even the most obvious signs of emergent risk events.

These reactions may be followed by considered application of logic and reasoning to the situation (risk as analysis), but this subsequent consideration may follow a path biased in favour of confirmation of affectively formed hypotheses. Such reactions are important within the context of organizational decision making and risk management because they may cause managers and employees to act in ways inconsistent with organizational effectiveness. In this chapter, I discuss how such biased decision processes unfold, two categories of harm that can result, and, especially, how an organization’s definitions of risk influence the process. I examine, in particular, how organizations sometimes convey definitions of risk and values relevant to risk management through formal systems, e.g., performance management systems, often without intending to or even realizing it; and also how such definitions and messages may interact with employees’ and managers’ affective reactions to risk. In organizational settings, people may over-perceive or over-react to risk, causing misallocation of limited resources, or they may under-estimate or under-react to risk, which can lead to disaster. I argue that risks defined, valued, and communicated about, and thus socially amplified by formal systems, are more likely to be perceived and assessed as unacceptable and worthy of attention. Risks not defined or communicated about are seemingly not valued and thus socially attenuated by formal systems, are more likely to not be perceived at all, or to be assessed as acceptable and ignored. Managers who take the time to consider these broad effects on risk management will be better equipped to help their organizations get risk management more right more often. © 2016 Torben Juul Andersen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107594501

Frontline employees acquire deep insights about operational uncertainties as they perform daily tasks and interact with internal and external stakeholders. Such experiential learning provides unique insights about operational uncertainties of strategic value, which are not otherwise available for proactive risk-taking by senior management. Drawing on a proactive risk-taking perspective, the chapter presents the relevance of sensing and leading predictions by frontline employees for capturing operational uncertainties. It presents the reader with the different steps of constructing an operational risk barometer (ORB) and provides a discussion of its use in practice. It outlines the implications of using sensing among frontline employees and other relevant stakeholders as a useful operational risk predictor and as an important information source in proactive risk-taking and dynamic strategic risk control processes. © 2016 Torben Juul Andersen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107578367

The content is based on practice-based research experiences supported by relevant literature on risk governance and values-based management complemented with insights from case analyses and empirical studies. The chapter explains why formal risk management approaches have limitations and outlines how the presence of official policies and codes of conduct is insufficient to deal with dynamic and complex high-impact situations where strong core values heeded by the corporate leadership, in contrast, leads the way to better risk behaviors throughout the organization. Major disasters in British Petroleum over the past decade illustrate how a formal code of conduct failed to do the job when the leadership in reality gave first priority to profits at the expense of the stated environmental values. The prioritized code of the US Coast Guard is used to illustrate the circumstances where core values support effective crisis, disaster and risk management outcomes. The findings go against conventional wisdom of imposing tighter rules and regulations with formal controls as a panacea to cope with major disasters and shows why simpler means of guiding core values combined with delegation of responsibility to act under unexpected conditions is important in both private and public enterprise. © 2016 Torben Juul Andersen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107542319

Risk governance is pivotal in accomplishing effective risk management outcomes. It starts at the top of the organization, and accounts for how the board of directors and the executive management board discuss, determine and communicate the company’s risk appetite. It is argued that proper decision-making processes that can compensate for the distortions ingrained in the human mind as well as establishing decision-making forums with a broader range of personal characteristics can avoid a uniform mind-set. However, the effectiveness of risk management and governance depends heavily on the organizational climate in which they take place. It is reasoned that effective risk governance must encourage risk awareness throughout the organization. This includes appropriate training to impart knowledge and confidence around the applied risk methodology fostering a common understanding of the company’s risk management norms. Incentives and sanction structures should be designed to encourage sound risk assessment in a risk-aware organization. It is argued that proper risk governance can lead to more effective risk management practices. Accordingly, regulators and other stakeholders are encouraged to consider qualitative rather than quantitative checklist-oriented controls in the risk management practice and evaluate the quality of the company’s risk management system to reduce the propensity for corporate scandals in the future. © 2016 Torben Juul Andersen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107540309

The study further reveals that employee and low-level managerial risk management competences strengthens the positive risk management effects of DRM and without these risk competences, DRM may significantly impede risk effectiveness.

These procedures do not compare well with state of the art advertising and branding strategy that include audio-visual communication and symbolic and emotionally engaging creative strategy. This paper investigates gender differences of advertising experiences. To this end, the authors present and evaluate the usefulness of an ad perception framework, composed of three perceptual dimensions developed from advertising execution theory, genre theory and cognitive film theory. A small empirical study aimed at demonstrating whether the framework is capable of measuring gender differences in advertising perception is presented. Main findings are that the scales based on the suggested framework capture gender differences in ad perception, suggesting that there may be subtle but significant differences in how men and women perceive advertising.

It is suggested that city planners act as stagers of urban development. The chapter unfolds the case of experiential planning in Vancouver, in which planners act as stagers of complex and participatory planning processes. It concludes the lessons for urban planning and questions the difficult balance between liveability and economic development. The pursuit of non-functional values by consumers is the starting point for Pine and Gilmore in their writings on the experience economy. Rather than seeing experience offerings as a separate production system, they see the most important potential for value creation in the integration of experiences in mundane products and services. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089010113

While this problem has been identified for many years (Edler et al., 2005), there have been no attempts to design an effective risk management framework that can be used to alleviate it. The major reason for this is the high level of complexity when it comes to defining, understanding and operationalizing risk, which are necessary in order to make it manageable in the first place. Risks associated with PPI do not only emanate from the nature of the innovation activity itself, but have a large number of different origins associated with the heterogeneity of the actor landscape in PPI. Moreover, different actors have different risk perceptions, and we often find a mismatch between actor groups benefiting from an innovation (users, suppliers, citizens) and those that bear the consequences of its failure. Against this background, the purpose of this chapter is to conceptualize risk and risk management in PPI and discuss the value of such a conceptualization for PPI practice and policy-making. Our conceptualization of risk and risk management in PPI refers to the various types of risks that are relevant to the public procurement process, and indicates some governance and managerial challenges these pose for PPI. © Charles Edquist, Nicholas S.

And is religion compatible with human rights? The answer to these often posed questions has typically been a straightforward no or yes (Banchoff and Wuthnow 2011: 3f.). Some commentators point to what they consider to be irreconcilable differences between the values and principles of the two meaning systems, arguing for the inherent incompatibility between religion and human rights. As Witte and Green (2012: 17) note, the human rights system teaches liberty, equality and pluralism, while most religions teach authority, hierarchy and orthodoxy. Others argue that human rights do in fact have religious roots, and that religious traditions and texts can be read as justification of principles of liberty, equality and pluralism, facilitating their compatibility with modern human rights.1. © 2015 Emma Tomalin.

In Denmark, however, this type of tourism has stagnated or even declined in the past few years, with overnight stays down by as much as 10-15 per cent from 2007 to 2011 (Erhvervs-og Vækstministeriet 2014; Hedetoft and Marcussen 2012). Consequently, the redevelopment of coastal tourism has achieved political focus on national and local levels. Coastal tourism development initiatives have hitherto mostly focused on the production side. Especially improved cooperation at destination level has been seen as a means to increase the joint promotion of the destination and its existing offer (Halkier 2013). In this context, innovation has hardly been an issue, and it has not been considered how tourists, among themselves or in interaction with producers, may contribute to tourism development and innovation (Sundbo and Sørensen 2013). The role of consumers in innovation is considered in theories on the experience economy. These theories have influenced tourism research and practice in recent years in three main ways (Manniche et al. 2014). First, at the level of the firm, where the focus is on experience innovation, and the question of whether and how it differs from service innovation (Sundbo et al. 2013; Sundbo and Jensen 2009; Fuglsang et al. 2011). This includes experience design, the way businesses organize and facilitate valuable experiences for particular segments (Eide and Mossberg 2013; Bærenholdt and Haldrup 2010). Second, experience economy concepts have influenced research on the tourist as a consumer, particularly within consumer culture theory. In this consumer perspective, physical products as well as immaterial experiences are understood as resources being bought and consumed as part of the social and cultural positioning of the consumer (Gyimóthy 2009a, 2009b). Moreover, the sharing of experiences gives meaning to and constructs the tourist experience for other tourists. Lastly, the experience economy has influenced local and regional tourism planning. With the experience economy has followed the realization that regional competitiveness is not only based on the competitiveness and mobility of goods and knowledge, but also on the competitiveness of regions to consumers as tourists (Lorentzen and Jeannerat 2013). Accordingly, local and regional authorities increasingly focus on enhancing the attractiveness of places (Lorentzen 2009, 2013), to the point where some places emerge as ‘experiencescapes’ (O’Dell and Billing 2005). Holiday home tourism and attraction tourism are the two most important types of tourism outside of metropolitan Denmark in terms of volume, share of Danish tourism overall, and economic importance for the host regions. It is also these two types of tourism that are most challenged (Hedetoft and Marcussen 2012). The overall aim of the chapter is to investigate the experiential and spatial dimensions of these two types of tourism. Can these two types of tourism be seen as forming two distinct experience production and consumption systems, characterized by different experience demands and geographical configurations? The chapter will discuss how value is created in the two types of tourism in the interaction between production, consumption and place, and discuss its implications for tourism and destination development policies. The hypothesis is that each type of tourism is dominated by different production and consumption systems which in turn produce two different types of tourism experiences. The chapter is organized in three main sections. First, its theoretical basis is discussed. The concepts of experiences and experiencing at the individual and organizational level are introduced, followed by a discussion of how the tourist destination may be perceived based on consumer experience demands. The section also briefly touches on what insights the emerging theorizing on territorial staging systems may bring to understanding the concept of the destination. The following section is empirical and starts with a description of the geographical distribution of tourism outside of metropolitan Denmark. This is followed by identification and analysis of the main value-creating economic activities in the two main types of tourism, holiday home and attraction tourism. Finally, the tourist experiences of each type are identified and analysed. The chapter closes with a discussion of the findings and their implications for the conceptualization of production and consumption systems in the experience economy as well as for tourism and destination development policies. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081036865

A varied literature exists that stresses the role of networking and collaborations among companies in local areas for economic development and innovation. For example, it has been argued that innovative milieus (Camagni 1991) embedded in local network structures facilitate knowledge transfer between or within sectors (Asheim et al. 2011; Frenken et al. 2007). Or that agglomeration of firms in a regional context reduces transaction costs between them (Storper 1995). Local buzz among companies has been seen as important for global sourcing of knowledge (Bathelt et al. 2004). However, these studies have also been criticized for their emphasis on proximity (Crevoisier and Jeannerat 2009; Lorentzen 2007); networking today in the era of globalization may be a more globalized and geographically distributed phenomenon than previously understood; companies source knowledge globally (Lorentzen 2007). Yet, in some sectors like tourism, the engagement of companies in local systems of collaboration can be important not just for sourcing of knowledge but also for the development of local products (Fuglsang and Eide 2013). Research also shows that small companies in rural areas may be difficult to engage in large-scale cooperation and innovation. Most of the literatures on company networks in regions have had a ‘productionist’ orientation (Jeannerat 2013). They tend to ignore the customers’ role. Yet, for tourism companies involving themselves in the experience economy, engaging customers in an active way is central to the business. Experiences can be defined as unique events that are remembered by customers (Sundbo and Sørensen 2013). Experiences require active consumer participation (Nilsen and Dale 2013), i.e. active attention from customers. Experiences can emanate people’s own activities and reflections, but these experiences can also be trig-gered by (economic) activities (Lorentzen and Jeannerat 2013). Experiences are combinations of the German Erlebniss and Erfahrung (Sundbo and Sørensen 2013). As Erlebniss experiences take place and are triggered in the present, however they also involve people’s Erfahrung, their past experiences and learning. Some people will pay attention to more experience attributes than others due to their previous experience and learning (Andersson and Andersson 2013; Snel 2013). Research has sought to distinguish companies whose business model is to trigger experiences as a special category of experience companies. However, classifying these companies based in, for example, NACE codes poses problems. These problems shall not be dealt with in this chapter however (see Sundbo 2009; Nilsen and Dale 2013). Rather, for the purpose of this paper it is argued that many types of companies can join forces to create experiences. Rural companies can trigger tourist experiences in many ways, for example by organizing such activities as kayaking, bicycling or walking, and more. Tourism companies can also more specifically try to stage experiences related to place. Place is here understood, following Gieryn (2000), as a geographical location which has material/physical form and which is invested with meaning and value. Hence place is not just a physical context for companies, but it is constructed by the activities that fill it with meaning and value, including company and consumer activities. By focusing place as a locus of business activities, tourism companies contribute to invest meaning and values in the place. In this way, according to Gieryn (2000), place is different from space: space is place minus the meanings and values that are attached to it. Attaching meaning to place can emanate from networks of companies in a local context forming value constellation in the sense of Normann and Ramirez (Normann and Ramirez 1993). A value constellation is ‘interorganizational networks linking firms with different assets and competencies together in response to or in anticipation of new market opportunities’ (Vanhaverbeke and Cloodt 2006: 259). Hence, companies in a tourism network within a tourism place can try to collectively develop place by creating a common web of meanings in the geographical place. However, tourism companies tend to be fragmented with different experience orientations, resources, interests and time frames. Studies of networking and value constellations in tourism and experience sectors are rare but some studies can be found. The concept of destination has been used in varied ways to describe local tourism contexts (see, for example, Framke 2002; Pearce 2013). However, destination is perhaps a misleading concept, because tourists often explore the place rather than link up with a destination. Value networking in tourism and experiences may therefore be better described as varied economic actors’ joint efforts constituting a web of meanings and values in the place. Hjalager (2000) has explored whether features of industrial districts as described in the literature on industrial districts can be found in tourism districts. She concludes that some evidence can be found. But there are also important features that discourage comparison of tourism districts and indus trial districts. For example, tourism firms have a tendency of free-rider behaviour. There is a lack of stabilized collaborative structures that enhance trust and reciprocity in tourism districts (Hjalager 2000). However, literature can also be found that emphasizes the importance of collective and joint efforts (Buhalis and Cooper 1998; Hjalager 2010; Nordin 2003; Weidenfeld et al. 2010). These literatures tend to support the notion that tourism innovation and the staging of tourism experiences through the investment of meaning in place can be a collaborative and even collective act. Collective actions may become more important for the tourism districts in the future as new value constellations emerge, due to, among others, the increased focus on staging experiences in tourism places (Fuglsang and Eide 2013). Yet we know little about how more dynamic and innovative network relations can evolve in tourism and experience sectors. Tourism and experience companies may be difficult to mobilize for large-scale network cooperation and innovation because they have little time and few resources for networking (Fuglsang and Eide 2013). Tourism and experience firms may have more fragmented changing relations to other companies as well as to the support structures they are surrounded by. They may be less inclined to collaborate in stabilized ways because they tend to be loosely coupled and not tightly technologically related. Alternative approaches to networking and innovation systems in services more broadly see them as loosely coupled (Sundbo and Gallouj 2000) or evolving around and from a problem and problem-solving activity that function as a focusing device (Tether and Metcalfe 2004). Small tourism companies may, however, be life-style entrepreneurs (Ateljevic and Doorne 2000) that pursue a quality of life and experiences for the owners rather than promotion of collaboration, regional development and growth. Each company has unique network relations to other companies (cf. Håkansson et al. 2009) but generally they tend not to add up to wider value constellations in a tourism place. Generally we know little about how tourism and experience companies are engaged in dynamic networking and collaboration about staging experiences in a place. Tourism companies may have individualized motives and pursue unique strategies in relation to other companies. Yet they may also occasionally need to be part of more collective collaborative structures. In the following it is explored whether and how small-scale networking can be a solution to networking problems. It is suggested that ‘bricolage networking’ can be a model of networking in tourism and experience sectors. While participants become engaged in these networks in fragile and tenuous ways they also have the potential to stage and trigger unique experiences together related to place, hence creating spatial dynamics. Referring to the literature on bricolage, the paper first discusses how collaboration in the experience sectors may be understood as ‘bricolage networking’ and how this can trigger high-level unique tourist experiences. Then drawing on the engagement theory of Laurent Thévenot (2001, 2007), the paper goes on to discuss three forms of engagement in bricolage networking. It further discusses how these three forms can be found in a revisited case study; it further discusses some of the implications for unique consumer experiences. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059353159

It identifies and elaborates from an Anglophone perspective four distinctive qualities of the contributions within this edited monograph. These are, firstly, that there is no single or unitary Francophone tradition or conception of learning through practice. This quality is highlighted through outlining something of the diversity of what constitutes Francophone perspectives and some accounting of the origin of these distinct conceptions. The case made is that although there are cultural and linguistic traditions across the Francophone world, there are also localised historical and cultural factors that promote difference and diversity within these accounts. Secondly, and regardless, there is an emphasis across the contributions on physically, socially and personally situated activity which stands as being distinct within Francophone accounts. This situatedness goes beyond an objective analysis of work-in-action in specific physical and social contexts (actions of workers), to include the situated nature of how individuals come to engage with what is being manifested in that context (e.g. how and on what bases they act). Thirdly, there is a pattern of contributions considering not only workers as active and critical meaning-makers, but the need to account for their bodily engagement with and consequences of their work. Further, that these focuses on the personal stand as being the point of analysis in some of the contributions that make this emphasis quite distinct. Fourthly, the means for understanding and organising support for learning through work seem distinct. The two sets of qualities referred to above suggest that Francophone traditions of professional didactics and ergonomics, and in particular, the emphasis on the situation and body, seem quite culturally distinct. They seem more analogous to laboratory and encounter sessions from the Anglophone world than what would be used in that world to organise work-based learning experiences. It is these four conceptions that are discussed in terms of what they contribute to the field of work and learning. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Cultural Emphasis; Educational Provision; Participatory Practice; Psychological Injury; Workplace Experience",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056892110

Place-bound experiential qualities, which can be exploited economically, create a direct link from the experience economy to spatial planning strategies at the city or municipal level as well as at the regional and national levels (Lorentzen 2012; Therkildsen et al. 2012). In that respect, cultural heritage plays a distinct role as economic as well as cultural resource (Graham et al. 2000). The other way around, place-bound experiences including cultural heritage seem to possess an interesting potential, when it comes to creating awareness and facilitating collaboration among stakeholders in the field of spatial planning (Jensen 2009; Delman and Nielsen 2009; Delman 2011; Landry 2008). For instance, Landry (2008: 119) emphasizes the role of local identity and distinctiveness as a means of cooperation for the common good, as it creates ‘a bond between people with different institutional interests’. In that regard physical cultural heritage can be understood in terms of a ‘tangible trace of collective memory’, as expressed by Kerr (2000: 71). Kerr refers to the specific role of public monuments, but he points out that ‘the fabric of the city itself represents a visible aide-mémoire’. As argued by Graham et al. (2000: 169) ‘the heritage of the conserved built environment, like culture more widely, is called upon to play a number of different roles in neighbourhood regeneration’. From that point of departure, this chapter focuses on how cultural heritage as part of the urban matter can function as an experiential resource in spatial planning. The national survey performed by the Danish Cultural Heritage Agency and the Realdania Foundation in 2004-5, emphasized the role of material cultural heritage as an experiential quality valued by citizens as well as enterprises (Kulturarvsstyrelsen and Realdania 2005). This survey initiated the nationwide Cultural Heritage Municipality programme, launched by the Danish Cultural Heritage Agency in 2005 (Kulturarvsstyrelsen and Realdania 2007). In order to facilitate the proper management of cultural heritage in Danish municipalities, the main goal of this programme was to promote and mobilize cultural heritage in urban as well as rural areas as a resource for spatial planning. A specific purpose of the programme was thus to facilitate local political awareness towards basic use-values as well as value-adding experience-oriented qualities of cultural heritage buildings, sites and environments. Furthermore, the programme intended to demonstrate the potential of cultural heritage as a source for place construction and creation of spatial narratives and identities as part of the Danish municipality reform in 2006-7 (Kulturarvsstyrelsen and Realdania 2007; Pluss 2011). The specific aim of the following analysis is to investigate how the tangible cultural heritage in the built environment can function as an experiential resource in municipal planning processes. To that purpose, the chapter includes a design exercise in order to establish a conceptual framework capable of categorizing different roles of cultural heritage in spatial planning projects. The empirical object of study will be the process related to the local Cultural Heritage Municipality Project in the municipality of Aalborg, which was one among four municipalities chosen to be ‘cultural heritage municipalities’ in the first of two periods (respectively 2006-8 and 2008-10) of the Danish cultural heritage municipality programme (Kulturarvsstyrelsen and Realdania 2008; Pluss 2011). The case study is based on experiences from active participation of the author in the collaborative planning process primarily during the period from 2006 to 2008 and again from 2010 to 2011. The cultural heritage project of Aalborg Municipality provides a nuanced example of how the perspectives of the experience economy have contributed to create positive awareness among stakeholders and a creative collaborative attitude among cultural heritage professionals. The case study is introduced in part 2 of the chapter. Methodologically, the experience economy concept establishes a platform for the analysis of holistic experience-oriented innovation processes in local development (Lorentzen 2013). The theoretical approach to the case analysis will be the conceptualization of territorial staging systems as described by Jeannerat (2015) in this volume. In part 3 this model will be transformed into the context of planning in order to establish a conceptual and analytical framework, as a means of identifying elements of the planning process as well as their dynamic relationships. In part 4, the empirical findings will be presented and analysed within the conceptual framework. The analysis will include the cultural heritage project period 2006-8 and the following collaboration until 2011, when the local plan for one of the industrial heritage sites of the project, Østre Havn, was introduced to the public. Finally, there will be a brief summing up, a conclusion and some further perspectives. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054660770

It contributes to academic and policy-oriented discussions about urban food systems by connecting issues at multiple scales to provide a snapshot of the complex relationship between gender and urban food systems. The chapter also draws on the concept of a ‘feminist foodscapes framework’ to emphasize the social justice questions at the heart of urban food security. It concludes with reflections on the practical benefits to food security programming that can result from a broad conceptualization of the links between gender inequality and food insecurity in cities. © 2015 RUAF Foundation and International Water Management Institute.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052086435

Today, a wide range of devices to detect and deter geese are in use, although their effectiveness is often highly variable due to habituation to disruptive or disturbing stimuli. An adaptive scaring device, focusing on and altering the disruptive stimuli to the presence of specific species could potentially reduce the risk of habituation and thereby provide an effective tool in the management of geese and other conflict species. In this paper, we present the first results of a preliminary field test of a newly developed adaptive bird scaring device. The system is able to recognise the behaviour of specific species based on their vocalisations and respond appropriately to this. The system reduced goose activity markedly when active, whereas goose activity increased when the system was deactivated. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Adaptive scaring; Agriculture; Barnacle goose; Grazing damage; Human-wildlife conflicts; Pattern recognition; Vocalisations",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051540238

In this article, we investigate the dynamics and strategies of R & D reorganisation through an in-depth case study of a global firm from the most globalised industry in terms of R & D, biotechnology. The article investigates dynamics of internationalisation of R & D in global networks by looking at: 1) the strategic drivers of location, either as a large potential market or as a pool of competencies; and 2) the evolution of the company and its R & D activities into emerging market locations: India, China and Brazil. Together, these two dimensions constitute the drivers of R & D internationalisation and contribute to the construction of global innovation networks through knowledge augmenting and exploiting strategies. The article shows how multinational enterprises can use a combination of augmenting and exploiting strategies in emerging markets and hence demonstrates that international R & D activities not always evolve in a sequential and ordered trajectory. © Rainer Hampp Verlag.","Biotech industry; Emerging markets; Evolutionary approach; Home-base augmenting; Home-base exploiting; Internationalisation of R & D; Strategic drivers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045667607

While some CSFs are intuitive (such as top management support), others seem to be overrated by the conceptual literature (e.g., the speed of the implementation). Most importantly, the BSC literature has some blind spots that relate to cost-benefit analyses of the BSC, the impacts of management skills and leadership, power and politics, organizational culture, and public discourse. © Rainer Hampp Verlag.","Balanced Scorecard; Implementation process; Literature review; Organizational change; Performance measurement system; Success factors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045019770

It also provides an insight into the challenges faced by outsourcing organisations and their suppliers in the Ghanaian operational environment. The study adopts a quantitative research approach, using a structured questionnaire with a fivepoint Likert scale ranging from 1 = fully disagree to 5 = fully agree. The data was collected from organizations represented in the MBA and executive MBA programmes at the University of Ghana Business School in 2008. These included private and public-owned firms as well as Not-For-Profit organizations. Statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 16.0). We find that the respondent organizations are likely to engage in outsourcing if the net cost reductions that it affords them are positive and/or if the decision frees internal resources which could then be deployed on core activities. We however found no evidence that foreign organizations in the sample behave differently from their local counterparts with respect to the nature of locally outsourced products/services. Finally, both local and foreign outsourcers are more likely to opt for larger and/or foreign suppliers due to their relative resource advantages and delivery reliability. The data set could be expanded in subsequent studies to cover a larger sample size. The findings suggest that organizations located in Ghana (and, by extension, in other African countries) could leverage resources through outsourcing. Outsourcing decisions should therefore take on a more strategic posture in the planning regimes of organizations in Ghana and other African economies. Overall the study provides an integrated perspective to the outsourcing debate in Africa and contributes to the global outsourcing debate in general. © 2015 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

Companies that compete globally require organizational operating models as robust as their strategies. Many companies have created elegant designs and consider their worldwide, matrix organizations sources of competitive advantage. However, the reality is that these complex structures bring many challenges and senior executives are often frustrated by the difficulties of delivering growth in organizations that span numerous brands, products, and geographic regions. After working closely with over twenty large US and Europe based global companies during the past decade, Gregory Kesler and Amy Kates concluded that the problem is not in the fundamental design of these operating models. The matrix is not going away. The challenge is to effectively and completely activate the organization to deliver the strategy.

To do so, we develop a framework structuring existing insights into four generic dimensions: People, means, effects, and goals. Based on this framework, we review studies on: Directive and participative leadership, interactive leadership, charismatic leadership, transformational leadership, transactional & instrumental leadership, strategic & CEO leadership, and shared & distributed leadership. We find strong indications that different innovation stages and types raise different demands on leadership. Against this background, transformational leadership is not the only style to lead innovations, but different leadership styles fit differently well with different innovation types and stages. However, the specification of this fit is still very incomplete and the answer to the question of how to lead innovations remains sketchy.

Assessing product systems applying the exact same unit process foundation would be expected to yield comparable result sets with either tool. The software performances are compared based on a random sample of 100 unit processes. The research question investigated here is; can there be a difference between SimaPro and GaBi influencing the results and the decisions based on them? In many cases the results are identical between SimaPro and GaBi or nearly so, but in other cases the results reveal differences. Some of these differences are so large that they could influence the conclusions. For some of the 100 unit processes, six elementary flows were inventoried differently in SimaPro and GaBi, with an extreme maximum comparative ratio of 109. The implementation of the impact assessment methodologies shows notable differences. For the same life cycle inventory the maximum result ratio for the characterized results is 0.0076 for Terrestrial Ecotoxicity Potential. The observed differences appear to originate primarily from errors in the software databases for both inventory and impact assessment. SimaPro and GaBi are used by many Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) practitioners worldwide as a decision-support tool; if the results of the present analysis are representative of the differences obtained when using either one or the other, then the implications of this paper are worrying.

The purpose is to present an outline of Danish companies’ CSR commitment and how this commitment is influenced by the political and institutional environment in Denmark. The chapter consists of three major parts. First, we present an introduction to CSR in Denmark. More specifically we provide an introduction to: (a) the Danish welfare state and its business environment, (b) how and why Danish companies are engaged in CSR and (c) the relation between the Danish welfare state and Danish companies’ CSR commitment. Second, we discuss whether CSR should be seen as extra-legal activities, i.e. something that goes beyond the demands of the state and the law. Here we conclude that CSR should not be regarded solely as social and environmental activities that companies voluntarily engage in, since companies might be said to do CSR just by acting in accordance with the demands of the state and the law. This follows recent developments in the understanding of CSR in the EU. Third, we present some future perspective on CSR in Denmark, including a suggestion to address the “new pathologies” affiliated with contemporary work life, i.e. the collapse of the work/life balance, stress, and so on. In our view there seems to be the basis for a “win-win” scenario when it comes to more focus on protection of the workforce against stress etc. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Corporate Social Responsibility; Corporate Social Responsibility Activity; Corporate Social Responsibility Engagement; Corporate Social Responsibility Policy; Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016076125

In densely populated metropolises such as Hong Kong, urban parks are in high demand. A variety of indicators can be used as tools for improving park planning and management. Facing a dynamic society and increasing user expectations, urban park managers in Hong Kong have encountered different challenges over time, and the quest for changing park managerial strategies. In 2004, a set of indicators for urban park management in Hong Kong was produced as part of a Master’s research. Local park managers were asked about their views on the respective importance and performance (I–P) of the indicators. In 2012, a follow-up questionnaire survey was conducted with the managers to study if their views regarding these indicators and their performance had changed. Results from the 2004 and 2012 surveys revealed changing perceptions regarding both I–P of the park indicators. Urban park managers in Hong Kong believed they have worked with the correct aspects of park management. They also had demonstrated an increasing satisfaction with the performance in most aspects of park management and improvements in the overall park condition. Shortcomings in urban park management in Hong Kong were also revealed through a cross-reference of the perceived I–P levels of indicators by managers. These problems include a prolonged shortage of funding by the park authority, the lack of integration of managerial and educational functions of urban parks, and a less responsive role of park managers to address the changing socio-economic condition in the city. Findings from this longitudinal study provide useful information about dynamic park management. The observations of park managers’ perceptions can assist in identifying areas of change and in guiding the direction for future park management. Moreover, these findings also provide a source of comparison, and perhaps inspiration for urban green space authorities in other cities. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Hong Kong; Indicators; Longitudinal study; Perception; Urban park managers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014181124

Current methods of measuring performance provide only limited insights into what actually happens in the sports facilities. Furthermore, few comparisons of the pros and cons of various performance measurement methods have been made. To inform research, policies and sports facility management strategies, we compare two new methods of collecting performance information. The first method collects performance information via a manual survey. The second method uses thermal cameras. A comparison of the methods shows that the number of persons measured using surveys is exaggerated more than understated and that more timeslots than necessary are deemed to be busy. Nevertheless, the survey method captures important qualitative aspects of performance not grasped by the thermal method. Finally, we discuss areas for improvement of these methods and suggest further developments for the survey method. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Measurement; Performance; Policy; Sport facilities; Utilisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014180378

The rise of the collaborative economy, also known as collaborative consumption, the sharing economy and peer-to-peer consumption, has been fuelled by a range of social, economic and technological factors, including a shift away from ownership towards temporary access to goods; the use of technology mediated transactions between producers and consumers; direct host-guest relationships that contribute to a higher level of perceived authenticity of tourism experiences; and higher levels of consumer risk-taking balanced against mechanisms such as peer-to-peer feedback designed to engender trust between producers and consumers. This paper explores and critically assesses the collaborative economy and its implications for tourism industrial systems. It achieves this by mapping out the current knowledge dynamics characterizing tourism and the collaborative economy, paying particular attention to the asymmetries of knowledge that are emerging. The paper then identifies and critically discusses five pervasive claims being made about the collaborative economy, arguing for a balanced assessment of such claims. Highlighting these claims allows us to pursue a more reflective research agenda and leads to a more informed, evidence-based assessment of the collaborative economy and tourism. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Collaborative consumption; Collaborative economy; Critical studies; Exchange; Sharing; Tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84997795075

Crowdsourcing in a B2B context is less well understood and, as such, much of our discussion will highlight business-to-business crowdsourcing. More generally discussion will address crowdsourcing relative to innovation and technology development and customer relationship management. Examples will be used to derive a general roadmap, and to identify specific areas worthy of increased attention. The roadmap is developed as a six-stage approach that begins with task specification and concludes with management of inputs generated from crowd-sourcing efforts. The roadmap emphasizes on early stages in the overall innovation management activity that is related to development and specification of the task to be crowdsourced, the identification of the crowd, the creation of the environment to connect the crowdsourcer, the task and the crowd, motivation of the crowd, and actual activities in reaching the crowd. Managing the input from the crowd is regarded as a later stage in the overall innovation management but also as a focal point in the arguments for improving B2B crowdsourcing. In crowd selection processes this paper aims at classifying the crowd related to the closeness to the company requesting deliberate choices between employees, partners, prequalifying participants or the general crowd.

We complement these data with information on game developers and the timing of all mergers and acquisitions during that period allowing us to separate vertically integrated games from independent games exclusive to a platform. First, we show that integrated games are associated with higher sales and higher prices than independent games. Second, we find suggestive evidence that most of the difference in performance is due to better release strategies and selection in game quality. We show that post-release marketing strategies do not seem to add value to vertically integrated games. Finally, we also find that exclusivity is associated with lower demand and higher prices due to lower inherent quality and better release strategies, respectively.

In the case of hospitals, technical, aesthetic and practice-based requirements are incorporated into negotiations around facilities, layout and operation, and a plethora of stakeholders are engaged in the process. This paper describes a case of the 'on-boarding' phase in the design of a new hospital in North Zealand, Denmark. It describes the use of various visualisations in the engagement of actors concerned with managing the budget and delivering the building programme as well as the eventual users of the hospital. It reveals how visualisations are mobilised to form different and overlapping types of spaces. These are described as economic spaces, concerned with maintaining the economic budget frame, when the client organization is communicating the project and the design to healthcare practitioners at the hospital; design spaces, which include forms of user involvement, when the design team is developing and testing a methodology for engaging with medical staff; organizational spaces, concerning the connection between new physical spaces and healthcare professionals, when members of the project organization work with the aim of facilitating organizational changes in the way health care is delivered at the hospital. Finally the paper discusses how these spaces are connected, and how they both enable and constrain innovation in design and healthcare.","Design; Hospitals; Space; Visualisation","Budget control; Health care; Hospitals; Project management; Visualization; Client organizations; Complex relationships; Design spaces; Health care professionals; Organizational change; Project organization; Space; User involvement; Design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84985912236

Furthermore, the spatial variability of yield or demand increases the complexity of the planning for these operations. When there is no knowledge of the spatial variability, or when intelligent machines make adjustments due to real-time conditions, a new intelligent planning system is needed. A real-time planning system is presented that monitors the capacity change and generates an optimal coverage plan for operations. The system was tested on the Lego operations test platform as a prelude to full-scale testing, utilising a colour map to represent the spatial variability. When the demand is known the planning system produced a solution that is 17%, on average, improved from the conventional coverage, in terms of the total travelled distance, while when demand was unknown the improvement in the total travelled distance was 7%, on average. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Lego test platform; Operations management; Real-time optimisation; Route planning",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84975819363

It is an interesting tendency that technological development should reflect and interact with central change processes of the enterprise. This is however colliding with challenges in case of normative or prescriptive strategies: Such strategies can be erroneous, misrepresenting, unsubstantiated, short lived, and centrered narrowly in internal top-level management processes. This paper discusses advantages, disadvantages and alternatives in connecting technological design tightly to the business strategy. The purpose of this paper is to advance a research agenda, where long-term orientation of technology is connected to the necessary tools for obtaining insight in assessing adequacy, reliability and quality of business strategy and evaluation of alternatives. Alternatives are related to business environments, compliance, infrastructure, knowledge, skills and societal factors.

As a consequence of the thermochemical surface engineering, huge residual stresses are introduced in the developing case, arising from the volume expansion that accompanies the dissolution of high interstitial contents in expanded austenite. Modelling of the composition and stress profiles developing during low temperature surface engineering from the processing parameters temperature, time and gas composition is a prerequisite for targeted process optimization. A realistic model to simulate the developing case has to take the following influences on composition and stress into account: - a concentration dependent diffusion coefficient - trapping of nitrogen by chromium atoms - the effect of residual stress on diffusive flux - the effect of residual stress on solubility of interstitials - plastic accommodation of residual stress. The effect of all these contributions on composition and stress profiles will be addressed. © 2015 ASM International®.",,"Austenite; Heat treatment; Low temperature effects; Optimization; Residual stresses; Temperature; Wear resistance; Concentration dependent diffusion coefficients; Expanded austenite; Gas compositions; Low temperatures; Plastic accommodation; Processing parameters; Surface engineering; Volume expansion; Stainless steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965154774

During treatment, austenite transformed to martensite. The isothermal austenite-tomartensite transformation was monitored in situ by magnetometry and data was used to sketch a TTT diagram for transformation. As an alternative treatment, after austenitization the material was immersed in boiling nitrogen and up-quenched to room temperature by immersion in water prior to be subjected to isothermal treatment. Magnetometry showed that the additional thermal step in boiling nitrogen yields a minor increment of the fraction of martensite, but has a noteworthy accelerating effect on the transformation kinetics, which more pronounced when the isothermal holding is performed at a higher temperature. Data is interpreted in terms of instantaneous nucleation of martensite during cooling followed by time dependent growth during isothermal holding. © 2015 ASM International®.",,"Austenite; Austenitic stainless steel; Austenitic transformations; Heat treatment; Isotherms; Magnetometers; Martensite; Metadata; Nitrogen; Accelerating effect; Austenitization; Immersion in waters; Instantaneous nucleations; Isothermal holding; Isothermal treatment; Time dependent; Transformation kinetics; Stainless steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965151226

The materials were plastically deformed to different equivalent strains by uniaxial tension. Gaseous nitriding of the strained material was performed in ammonia at atmospheric pressure in the temperature range 693-703 K (420-430°C). Microstructural characterization of the as-deformed states and the nitrided case included X-ray diffraction analysis, reflected light microscopy and microhardness indentation. The results demonstrate that a case of expanded austenite develops and that, in particular, the presence of strain-induced martensite in the initial (deformed) microstructure has a large influence on the nitrided zone. © 2015 ASM International®.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric temperature; Austenite; Austenitic stainless steel; Characterization; Hardening; Heat treatment; Low temperature effects; Nitriding; Plastic deformation; Strain; Temperature; X ray diffraction analysis; Austenite stability; Equivalent strains; Expanded austenite; Low temperature surface hardening; Micro-structural characterization; Microhardness indentation; Strain-induced martensite; Temperature range; Stainless steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84965150910

Determining a financial option's volatility is not a problem because it is based on the uncertainty in one variable-price, and it is projected into the future for a relatively short time. For real options, there are multiple methods to calculate volatility and there is no well-defined approach to the question of which sources of variability should be included, and for how long. Many applications use a volatility projection based on the project's life that is incorrect when the concept of actionable volatility is applied. Actionable volatility recognizes that only some and not all uncertainty is resolved when a real option is exercised. Thus this approach limits what variables are included, and for how long, in determining the project volatility parameter. Real options methods have been accused of overpricing options, and we find that traditional real option pricing methods would have dramatically overpriced options in the oil and gas sector in the past few years. Inflated volatility is the primary reason. The concept of actionable volatility limits the forecasting horizon and considers oil price reversion to the mean-both limit the value of the real option. The focus of the paper is to demonstrate a problem with the current methods of valuing real options, and an approach to correct the problem. The recent dramatic decrease in energy prices serves as another reminder that the adoption of complex mathematical models without fully understanding their underlying assumptions can lead to serious financial problems. © American Society for Engineering Management, 2015.","Oil prices; Real options; Volatility","Economics; Finance; Gas industry; Petroleum industry; Oil Prices; Real option analysis; Real option pricing; Real option values; Real Options; Sources of variability; Volatility; Volatility parameters; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963779194

The latter objectives are better realized from spinning out successful new companies, which compared to licensing create advantages both for the university and the academic inventor. Although universities generally struggle to successfully commercialize research results as new firms, some universities are much better than others at spinning out companies. The research has not identified a singular formula to increase university spin-outs. A common theme in much of the empirical evidence is that academics/university researchers lack knowledge related to market development which must be supplemented for successful commercialization. This study analyses the role of non-research students in developing knoweldege about markets to supplement the knowledge-gap among academics, which as far as we know have not been widely explored. The analysis is based in the context of a technical university which provides a unique opportunity to explore how students working to fulfil academic requirements can create momentum around a technology to increase its spinout potential. The results show that students working with potential spin-out technologies as class projects are seen as nonthreatening which allow them to gather useful market information. This early information can stimulate interest leading to partnership development as well as help to identify advantages and challenges for different applications of a technology. © American Society for Engineering Management, 2015.","Knowledge gap; Student resources; Technology commercialization; University Spin-outs","Commerce; Earnings; Economic and social effects; Education; Societies and institutions; Students; Academic requirements; Knowledge gaps; Market development; Market information; Partnership development; Technical universities; Technology commercializations; University spin-outs; Engineering education",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963766105

Traditionally, two technologies - operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) - have operated independently from one another; however, technological advancements that businesses are experiencing have increased the overlap and convergence of these two areas. Industrial organisations are investing heavily in the integration and alignment of these technologies and expect to benefit in several ways from this convergence, such as through increased productivity, reduction in cost, and real-time intelligence. This paper presents the case of General Electric (GE) and studies the various transitional phases and transformation dimensions that GE is experiencing, to manage this technology convergence. The evaluation of GE's experience indicates that convergence-related business transformation is nonlinear, and that some dimensions and stages of transformation previously thought to be relevant may not be pertinent for successful business transformations through technology convergence.

We view organisations as complex, dynamic, relational landscapes (Shotter 1998) where meaning is constantly co-constructed. Likewise, leading is viewed as something that arises in the presence of employees, other leaders and other participants, and consists of a number of social processes that enable people to work together and coordinate their actions. © Mette Vinther Larsen and JØrgen Gulddahl Rasmussen 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960427634

In the following section, we focus on the area of conflict between an approach of dialogue and an approach of power in relations between people in an organisational context. Both approaches are interesting when seen from a relational perspective, as both power and dialogue can be understood as constituent parts of co-constructed social realities.

Instead it should be seen as an umbrella term covering a number of specific organisational tasks that are embedded in and developed through organisational actors' cooperation. Within this relational perspective, however, the formally appointed leader may still be positioned at the centre of the analysis.

This study reveals that SMEs pay less attention to organizational innovation. However, they are much more focused on production innovation in the interest of servicingmarkets. Furthermore, the study reveals that a major factor that influences the uptake of innovation from downstream are not final consumers, but rather government agencies. For instance, most SMEs involved in the study search for funds to buy small oil refinerymachines after government bans of the selling of rawoil. This suggests that processors still think consumers will absorb everything because there is lack of supply and demand is high. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Munich/Boston.",,"Government agencies; Government ban; Major factors; Organizational innovation; Qualitative study; Supply and demand; Tanzania; Economics",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960301867

Founders that invest more of their own money into their ventures signal greater commitment to potential business partners, suppliers, and resource providers.This study examines the amount of personal funds invested by 1,214 nascent entrepreneurs in the United States, between the years of 2005 and 2012. Findings demonstrate that the dollar amount of personal money invested prior to launch does not significantly impact the creation of new firms. However, nascent entrepreneurs that invest larger amounts as a proportion of their net income are more likely to succeed and are less likely to disengage from the process. Personal funds invested as a proportion of net income may therefore be a better measure of future success than the precise amount.

However the industry also encompasses a series of small and medium-sized enterprises, either as suppliers or as value adders, focused on smaller submarkets. This paper focuses on the specific situation in the automotive industry of a medium-sized manufacturer of tankers for trucks in the road transport industry. The company delivers design, manufacturing and service of high quality products to its customers within an engineer-to-order and manufacture-to-order market. The company faces a range of conflicting demands. The company operates in Northern Europe and benefits from proximity to its customers, yet experiences pressure from low cost, volume manufacturer competitors. Its operations strategy focuses on improving efficiency while maintaining the high value adding element to meet the needs of its identified market. The paper provides a case analysis aimed at evaluating the company's operation strategy, and more specifically its efforts to improve layout, and synchronizing material flows and bills of materials, where the use of kits, bundles of materials and location of stocks, are prominent aspects of production. An operations management theoretical framework is adopted including material handling and layout concepts. The contribution builds on interviews with key informants within the company as well as document analysis and the presence of one author within the company over a longer period. The paper evaluates the development of the company's operations strategy. It describes the analysis made of internal logistics and the bills of material as well as the role of business strategy, market and fluctuations in personnel numbers, together with the operations strategy steps taken subsequently.

With their popular appeal and multimodal affordances social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have generated both media and scholarly interest in their possibilities for granting visibility to and facilitating the organization of activism. However, the role of social media in sustaining civic engagement beyond protest and fatalism remains under-explored. How can social media contribute to sustaining longer-term involvement of civil society? What is the potential of social media for making available alternative social imaginaries? And what role may social media play in facilitating social change through cooperation with business? This volume offers answers to these questions by providing empirical examples of civic engagement and social media in different societal contexts that explicitly address conceptions of civic engagement. © Respective authors 2015.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959122353

Although I will argue that ethical competency is a self-referential form of knowing, I will not provide an operational definition as that would be counter-productive; the focus of the chapter is on the very essence of what it means to be ethical – as well on how such a state of being can be realized and the relevance of ethical competency for organizational leaders. © Knut J.

The transition from a society based mainly on industrial production to a society where the production of knowledge and services is in focus has meant big changes in the organizing of the labour market. From the 1990s onward, norms concerning work, employment and learning have become increasingly integrated with general economic policy and the development of the market. Many of the regulatory changes introduced have been motivated by factors that have no direct connection to the content of work or with the work contract itself but with reference to market development and state budgetary resources. Both the direction and scope of the regulatory changes implemented in the past two decades can be said to have followed broadly the economic development. Discussions about how responsibility for an equitable sharing of risks in the labour market should be organized have been lively. This development may be understood in terms of the emergence of a new type of regulatory state and new forms of governance and control, with an emphasis on transparency and monitoring. A number of researchers have analysed the transformation of the public sector in terms of the emergence of an ‘audit society’ where new ideas and norms for governance and control have been established (Power 1997; Strathern 2000). © Christina Garsten, Jessica Lindvert and Renita Thedvall 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958908322

In the present chapter we illuminate how small business entrepreneurs engage in activities of importance for social sustainability and development as they undertake entrepreneurial ventures. This chapter thus examines how small-scale entrepreneurial venturing in a developing country contributes to both sustaining and changing societal structures. Poor people’s participation in markets are in many developing countries restricted by ‘institutional voids’ (Mair and Marti, 2009). In contexts characterized by institutional voids, institutions that support markets are absent or malfunction (Khanna and Palepu, 1997). Extant research primarily differentiates between three types of institutional voids, namely voids that restrict market creation, obstruct market functioning and impede market participation (Mair and Marti, 2009). Voids that impede market creation may comprise weak or absent governance structures, property rights and the rule of law (Mair et al., 2007). Developing countries characterized by institutional voids often lack formal institutions that support market functioning. However, weak formal rules and institutions do not imply an absence of informal, social or cultural-cognitive institutions and norms (Bohannan and Dalton, 1965; Moore, 1978). Developing countries may be characterized by formal institutional voids but may be rich in informal institutions, traditions, customary practices and beliefs which are believed to often impede social and economic development by restricting people from access to the market (Mair and Marti, 2009). © Paula Kyrö 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958867866

Research shows that skills development creates profitable workplaces and strengthens the health and well-being of employees (Ellström 1996; Holmer 2006: 23; Nilsson 1996; Rönnqvist and Thunborg 1996; Thång 2006). Access to skills development at different employers is mapped on a regular basis by quantitative compilations documenting which employees are offered training, and how access varies according to occupational group, gender and age group, and over time (Statistics Sweden). We know from these studies that those who already have good formal skills and knowledge tend to get more, while those with weaker formal competency get less. People with high education are given access more than low-educated people, public-sector employees participate more than employees in the private sector, and the proportion of women who take part is larger than the proportion of men (Ds 2002:47; Statistics Sweden 2007; SCB 2008; SOU 2000:115; Wikman 2001). In the chapter, we take the discussion one step further and show that formal access to skills development in working life and actual ability to participate in skills development are not always the same thing. The reasoning concerning actual ability is inspired by the work of Amartya Sen. Based on the concept of capabilities, Sen criticizes traditional economics’ method of measuring economic and social development (1982, 1988, 1993). According to Sen, national economics has singly focused on the resources offered to people. © Christina Garsten, Jessica Lindvert and Renita Thedvall 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958864124

The essay takes its point of departure in an analysis of values. It suggests that values are a correlate of valuation devices and that these evaluation devices constitute a semantic space that is called, for want of a better term, ""brand."" The brand as a semantic space makes values visible, providing a platform upon which claims, calculations, and categorizations compete, collide, and sometimes coalesce. The essay concludes by discussing the implications of this argument for, among other things, the higher education sector.

It shows that MBOR has been marked by continuity since its introduction in the 1980s, and has become a central element in the steering and management of agencies in central government in all three countries. Nevertheless, gradual changes that have altered the direction of the MBOR discourse over time can also be identified. The direction changes from autonomy and a simple MBOR system in the early years toward more control and a more comprehensive system in the 1990s, and back again toward more autonomy and a less comprehensive MBOR system in recent years. The development processes in the three countries are characterized by some differences, but seem also to share numerous similarities. Explanations of these differences and similarities are discussed in the final section of the paper.

It is shown that the number of recommendations can be explained by six different underlying factors which account for the vast majority of the variation. The analysis reveals that the official classification of the three different sections in the Danish corporate governance must be abandoned. It is interesting to note that even though the “comply or explain” principle assumes that a meaningful explanation is equally good as compliance - the analysis documents that the vast majority of the firms complies with the recommendations. The article introduces a new methodology to measure the degree of compliance within these specific areas. This categorization serves as input for a multivariate analysis that explores how the different recommendations covariate as well as can be placed into distinct discrete groups. The policy implication is that future code revisions should rely on a multivariate approach when seeking to classify and structure the different code sections regarding the firm’s stakeholders. Otherwise, there is a risk that board members may associate a large number of recommendations as mechanistic “tick the box” exercises, which does not add value. © 2016, Internationala Journal of Business Science and Applied Management.

The stock of bunker on a vessel is subject to a number of operational constraints such as capacity limits, reserve requirements and sulphur content. Contracts are often used for bunker purchasing, ensuring supply and often giving a discounted price. A contract can supply any vessel in a period and port, and is thus a shared resource between vessels, which must be distributed optimally to reduce overall costs.

One of the topics of this chapter is concerned with development of indicators to determine whether or not the specification of the input and output space is supported by data in the sense that the variation in data is sufficient for estimation of a frontier of the same dimension as the input output space. Insufficient variation in data implies that some inputs/outputs can be substituted along the efficient frontier but only in fixed proportions. Data thus locally support variation in a subspace of a lower dimension rather than in the input output space of full dimension. The proposed indicators are related to the existence of so-called Full Dimensional Efficient Facets (FDEFs). To characterize the facet structure of the CCR- or the BCC-estimators, (Charnes et al. Eur J Oper Res 2:429–444, 1978; Banker et al. Manage Sci 30(9):1078–1092, 1984) of the efficient frontier we derive a dual representation of the technologies. This dual representation is derived from polar cones. Relying on the characterization of efficient faces and facets in Steuer (Multiple criteria optimization. Theory, computation and application, 1986), we use the dual representation to define the FDEFs. We provide small examples where no FDEFs exist, both for the CCR- and the BCC estimator. Thrall (Ann Oper Res 66:109–138, 1996) introduces a distinction between interior and exterior facets. In this chapter we discuss the relationship between this classification of facets and the distinction in Olesen and Petersen (Manage Sci 42:205–219, 1996) between non-full dimensional and full dimensional efficient facets. Procedures for identification of all interior and exterior facets are discussed and a specific small example using Qhull to generate all facets is presented. In Appendix B we present the details of the input to and the output from Qhull. It is shown that the existence of well-defined marginal rates of substitution along the estimated strongly efficient frontier segments requires the existence of FDEFs. A test for the existence of FDEFs is developed, and a technology called EXFA that relies only on FDEFs and the extension of these facets is proposed, both in the context of the CCR-model and the BCC-model. This technology is related to the Cone-Ratio DEA. The EXFA technology is used to define the EXFA efficiency index providing a lower bound on the efficiency rating of the DMU under evaluation. An upper bound on the efficiency rating is provided by a technology defined as the (non-convex) union of the input output sets generated from FDEFs only. Finally, we review recent uses of efficient faces and facets in the literature. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.","Convex analysis; Data envelopment analysis; Dual representation of technologies; Efficiency measurement; Faces; Facets; Frontier estimation; Model misspecification; Rates of substitutions; Test for facets; Virtual multipliers",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955141817

The general objective of the SuperGreen project has been to support the development of sustainable transport networks by fulfilling requirements covering environmental, technical, economic, social and spatial planning aspects. The chapter deals only with surface freight transport, including maritime transport, noting however that the quality of transport and logistics services is also affected by passenger transport competing for route capacity. Aviation is outside the scope of our analysis, as is the use of pipelines for liquid cargoes. In addition, the chapter provides examples of the corridor development approaches employed in Europe, and describes the performance monitoring methodology developed by SuperGreen. The deep sea service linking China to Europe is compared to the trans-Siberian rail link between Beijing and Duisburg as an example. Finally, the new transport infrastructure policy of the European Union is reviewed to investigate the relationship between green corridors and the recently introduced concept of TEN-T core network corridors in order to derive implications for corridor governance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955066580

We address this issue by comparing the impact of management of similar organizations—schools—in very different national contexts, the unitary and corporatist Denmark and the fragmented, adversarial Texas. We hypothesize that external as well as internal management matter more in Texas than Denmark. This is because Texas principals can gain power by negotiating the adversarial system, while the corporatist influence of teachers reduces the decision authority of principals in Denmark through collective agreements and important shop stewards. Based on combinations of parallel surveys of school principals and archival data on student performance, we confirm that aspects of both external and internal management matter substantially in Texas while having virtually no effect in Denmark.

Practice theorization offers a broad church, with many partially overlapping sets of interests and concerns, as discussed in the collection of writings found in The Practice Turn in Contemporary Theory (Schatzki, Knorr Cetina and von Savigny 2001). In this chapter we seek to show the variety of points of contact between the sensitivities making up a strategy-as-practice research agenda and those arising from actor–network theory as one particular part of this broader set of theories. Through such an engagement, we find opportunities for SAP research to pursue its agenda and to address a range of critiques that it has faced from those frustrated that its progress so far has not been as great as hoped. In setting itself a core agenda, the strategy-as-practice approach questions the view that ‘strategy is something organizations have’, with a view to shifting to consideration of ‘strategy as something people do in organizations’ (Whittington 2006). Pursuing such an agenda has radical implications, questioning as it does the notion of strategy as a legitimate resource at the hands of top management. By making practice central to understanding strategy, this literature suggests that the locus of strategizing is dispersed (for anyone participating in the organization has the potential to engage in strategizing) and the instantiation of strategy may follow a complex, non-linear and less determinate trajectory involving the interplay of multiple conflicting logics. Among all of the development and debate around the strategy-as-practice agenda, we trace some particular criticisms that have been made (namely Araujo and Easton 1996; Whittington 2006; Rasche and Chia 2009). We focus our discussion around these, since we find that they are helpful as a way to reiterate and develop central aspects of the agenda of SAP research. More importantly, given the focus of this chapter, we find that these criticisms can be directly addressed through the adoption of elements of actor–network theorizing into strategy-as-practice research. Overall, then, we present these criticisms not as judgement of the quality or intentions of the field. Rather, we see them as comments made about particular subsets of studies that serve a useful purpose as conceptual tools to further strengthen and develop the field. With this caveat on the role of these criticisms in this chapter firmly in mind, we now briefly rehearse them. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953911598

De Certeau (1984: 93) Introduction Most traditional approaches to strategy research have tended to consist of a complex amalgam of activities comprising the analyses of dependent and independent variables, theoretical conjecturing and the testing of theories and models developed to capture the essence of strategic realities (Rasche 2008). In this regard, the strategy-as-practice approach to research is a welcome departure in its single-minded insistence on focusing primarily on what strategy practitioners actually do. Although the strategy-as-practice field has attracted a mass of empirical work (Balogun and Johnson 2005; Jarzabkowski 2005; Jarzabkowski and Wilson 2002; Paroutis and Heracleous 2013; Regnér 2003; Samra-Fredericks 2003) and theoretical clarification (Denis, Langley and Rouleau 2007; Jarzabkowski, Balogun and Seidl 2007; Johnson, Melin and Whittington 2003; Whittington 1996; 2003; 2006; for a recent review, see Vaara and Whittington 2012), the alternative epistemological groundings available and how they may affect further efforts at conceptualizing strategy as practice remain relatively unarticulated. This is despite the fact that there have been some notable attempts to clarify research and methodological priorities for the SAP movement (Balogun, Huff and Johnson 2003; Ezzamel and Willmott 2010; Jarzabkowski 2003; 2004; 2005; Johnson, Melin and Whittington 2003; McCabe 2010; Tsoukas 2010; Whittington 2006). For researchers it is vital to give substantial consideration to the manner in which accounts and explanations proffered on strategy practice are reflexively moderated by an acute awareness of the inherent problems relating to the ‘situatedness’ of strategic action, and hence the epistemological issues associated with such attempted representations. The manner in which academically articulated accounts of strategy practice tend to create a schism between such accounts and the very practices they purport to explain is one of the most intractable problems of the research process. Such a schism can be addressed and rectified only through a careful examination of the dominant research dispositions and the nature and limitations of the resultant explanatory outcomes involved. © Cambridge University Press 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953874855

Taking an interaction approach (IMP Group, 1982), a conceptual structure highlighting possible patterns of characteristics of the asymmetric customer-supplier relationship and approaches to self- and/or collective interests in goal development has been created.Based on a multiple case study approach, the findings suggest that smaller suppliers who deliberately pursue self-interest in their business activities with larger customers experience better outcomes. Larger customers recognise that the creation of collective business goals enhances the outcome of joint efforts in terms of market impact and profitability. The findings also highlight that trust is perceived as a necessity for the development of collective interests in asymmetric relationships and that the power of the larger customer is not perceived as a constraint. A key conceptual contribution is the identification of two distinct types of asymmetric relationships: 'product/technology-oriented' in which self-interest dominates by focusing on one party's resources for developing new products or technology and 'complementary competencies-oriented' in which collective interests link the competencies of the larger and smaller party for new joint business ambitions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.","Asymmetric relationships; Collective interest; Goal development; Relationship characteristics; Self-interest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84952629691

Buying and supplying companies have joint, but also opposing goals, and conflict therefore emerges regularly as a potentially destructive force that must be managed in order to ensure effective exchange. Sometimes, conflicts can develop into particularly severe proportions resulting in considerable damages to the exchange. Therefore, they represent a core managerial concern, which has not yet been dealt with adequately in extant research. In this paper, we first contribute by making an initial attempt at conceptualising severe conflict. Next, we investigate severe conflict resolution processes in three buyer-supplier relationships through qualitative inquiry. We find a common resolution pattern across the cases, where severe conflict first propels the key actors into a vacuum stage characterised by avoidance. Communication between other relevant actors then raises awareness of the conflict broadly in the two organisations, leading to organisational intervention that establishes a new interpersonal core link, which is functional, although plagued by an aftermath. Overall, severe conflict resolution emerges as a lengthy and unplanned process, resolved at both the interpersonal and inter-organisational levels of exchange. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Buyer-supplier relationship; Case study; Conflict resolution; Qualitative research; Severe conflict",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84951853187

However, extant literature on firm’s technology innovation usually assumes that the R&D outcome is certain, which does not hold in many real-world situations. To fill this gap, this paper investigates an innovating firm’s licensing strategy in a differentiated Cournot duopoly model when the firm is an insider and the R&D outcome is stochastic. We develop a duopoly game model in which the innovating firm has three options for licensing its innovation: fixed-fee licensing, royalty licensing and two-part tariff licensing. We consider three stages in the model: the R&D, licensing and output stages. We find that product differentiation and technology spillover play significant roles in the innovating firm’s choice between fixed-fee and royalty licensing. In addition, regardless of the degree of product differentiation, we find that (1) two-part tariff licensing is superior to both fixed-fee and royalty licensing when technology spillover is low and that (2) two-part tariff licensing is equivalent to royalty licensing when technology spillover is high. © 2015, Kauno Technologijos Universitetas.

The article argues that there are elements in classical crowd theory which can be used to advance the current research on tourist crowds such as those at pub crawls. The main strength of the theories lies in their ability to bring us close to crowd dynamics in their lived immediacy: the flow of emotions, collective attunement, the role of guides, and patterns of destructionâ€”these are some of the issues that the theories can help us to understand. A major weakness of the theories is that they exaggerate the irrationality of crowds while neglecting the background conditions of crowd activities. The article is based on fieldwork among Danish tourists and guides in Sunny Beach. The key data come from 45 in-depth interviews and observations of 14 pub crawls. © 2015, SAGE Publications.

Qualitative interviews with a diverse group of self-catering tourists enable an explorative discussion of food experiences of self-catering tourists. The analysis demonstrates that food has an experiential potential for a broad cross-section of self-catering tourists, but also that food is considered a non-experiences by some.

Despite this assertion, little evidence has surfaced to support the idea that market-led governance offers a superior model of leadership for regional tourism. This paper adopts an embedded case study approach, undertaking a comparison of leadership in two RTOs that are operating in the same geographical location but under different governance regimes. Semi- structured interviews with executives/leaders and stakeholders/followers were undertaken in two RTOs: a market-led organization and a government-led organization. The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of governance arrangements on the capacity of these RTOs to lead tourism. Findings reveal that while dimensions of governance such as participation, efficiency, legitimacy, accountability, effectiveness and transparency influence a RTO's capacity to lead, good governance and strong leadership were not necessarily synonymous. RTOs can demonstrate varying levels of effectiveness in different dimensions of governance and leadership can be strong in some aspects and weak in others at the same time.

EUD can be seen both as the logical next step to intensified user integration as proposed in many agile methods as well as a radically new approach to not only interact with but rather empower end-users to (partially) design and create themselves. As in many emerging research areas, EUD lacks clear definitions, concepts and a common understanding of its prospects and limits to both researchers and practitioners. Consequently, this paper aims to address these shortfalls and highlights implications for practice by building a conceptual model of EUD application. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","End-user development; Information systems development; Software engineering","Agile manufacturing systems; Human computer interaction; Information systems; Information use; Management information systems; Software engineering; Agile methods; Conceptual model; End user development; End user development(EUD); Information systems development; New approaches; User integration; Waterfall model; Software design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946780526

In this paper, this current view of idea evaluation is challenged through the development of a prototype that supports dynamic idea evaluation. The prototype uses knowledge created during evaluative processes to facilitate divergent thinking in a Group Creativity Support System (GCSS) designed from state-of-the-art research. The prototype is interpretively explored through a field experiment in a Danish IS research department.

Methodology/approach - The chapter draws on a pilot study of the Facebook pages of two banks. A rhetorical criticism of these pages was conducted. Findings - We suggest that while corporations are assuredly entities very different from the individual citizens who hold civil, social, and political rights - which do not directly apply to corporations - rhetorical citizenship is nevertheless a suggestive and constructive metaphor for corporations to communicate by. Research limitations/implications - Rhetorical citizenship for corporations must, we argue, be(come) rooted in organizational reality, and should involve a continued critical questioning as to what might constitute citizenly communication for corporations under any given circumstances. The chapter is, however, built on limited data from a pilot study and needs to be complemented. Practical implications - We suggest from our pilot study that the active engagement of corporations in social media may currently be seen as one form of rhetorical citizenship that the public expects corporations to enact. Thus, we argue, corporations in general might as well attempt to do their best to act as rhetorical citizens. Originality/value - The chapter highlights how communication is a set of practices in which social responsibility must be enacted. We find that this is not a prevalent perspective in the existing literature on CSR and communication. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946164977

Why do they engage in innovating how they create, deliver, and capture value? And how does such innovation translate into innovation performance? Despite the importance of business model innovation for achieving competitive advantage, existing evidence seems to be confined to firm-level antecedents and pays little attention to the impact of industry structure. This study investigates how different stages of an industry's life cycle and levels of industry competition affect firms' business model innovation, and how such innovation translates into innovation performance. Based on a cross-industry sample of 1,242 Austrian firms, we introduce a unique measure for the degree of innovation in a firm's business model. The results indicate that the degree of business model innovation is highest toward the beginning of an industry life cycle, that is, in the emergent stage. Competitive industry pressures turn out to be negatively related to the degree of business model innovation. Moreover, we find that the degree of a firm's business model innovation, conditional on it having introduced a new product or process recently, positively influences innovation performance. Our findings contribute to the ongoing dialog on the role of industry structure in business model innovation, and provide implications for the management of business model innovation.

The campaign was successful and was followed by other similar campaigns to protect world heritages around the world. At the UN conference on Human Environment 1972 The World Heritage Convention was accepted. For many years protection was the one and only goal in respect to world heritage sites. However, over time world heritage sites have achieved a position as tourism destinations as many visitors have wanted to experience the unique world heritages by travelling to the world heritage sites to enjoy the uniqueness by own eyes. It has changed the UNESCO policy in relation to world heritages sites to not only include protection but also sustainable tourism, as formulated in the convention of 2012. World heritage is defined as a universal heritage from the past that is found important to pass on into the future. It can either be of cultural or natural character. It shall have a unique value and be considered as irreplaceable sources of inspiration for mankind. In 2014, the world heritage list includes about 1000 items in form of cultural and natural heritages sites. They are placed in 150 countries and three quarter of the world heritage sites are cultural sites. More than half of the cultural heritage sites are located in Europe and so are also a quarter of the natural world heritage sites. 190 states i.e. almost all states in the world have ratified The World Heritage Convention and in many states world heritage sites have a role in the national tourism policy. This article investigates the role of the world heritage sites in the EU as destinations and drivers of tourism in the EU countries’ tourism policy. The analysis is mainly a macro analysis made by alying strategy theory. It is the first study of this kind. It is found that that using world heritage sites pull factors for tourism destination development differ in the national tourism policy in the EU-countries. Some EU-countries make extensive use of world heritage sites and experience a growth in their tourism while other EU-countries make no or little use of world heritage sites in their tourism and experience difficulties in their tourism development. The tourism development in the single EU-counties is analyzed, characterized and presented in relation to the way world heritage sites are included in their tourism policy. Also, some of the corporations offering world heritage tourism are presented. Finally, the role of the world heritage in EU tourism at a supranational level as well as at a micro-level is presented stressing the need for development of relevant strategic tourism research. © Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945349349

In doing so, the paper argues that marketing historical research is in need of a paradigmatic shift. Rather than privilege primary and secondary sources that preserve the perspectives and actions of corporate managers and of marketing academics, marketing historians need to open the historical narratives they construct much more than before to the experiences and voices of ordinary consumers, i.e. of those who actually shop and buy and choose. They also need to do more to incorporate into their narratives examples of the value-creation that consumers themselves enact, both inside and outside the sphere of the market. Design/methodology/approach – By reviewing the state of the marketing historical literature, this paper introduces the “History from Below” school of historical thought into marketing historical research. It also tests to what extent a stronger consumer focus might be able to enrich historical research in marketing. Findings – Although contemporary marketing historiography is characterized by a richness of themes and methodological approaches, there is still a marked difference between the way marketing academics and historians write the history of marketing and consumption. While, surprisingly, the former often tend to ignore the voices of ordinary consumers, the latter often lack the marketing-related “technical” knowledge to fully understand the significance of specific archival sources they discuss. This means that a genuine “People’s History of Marketing” has yet to be written. Research limitations/implications – Findings from the paper will be of value to marketing historians who wish to expand the scope and agenda of their research and help historical research move away from narrow managerial perspectives and other “privileged” accounts of marketing. Originality/value – This paper makes two original contributions. First, it introduces historiographical innovations associated with “History from Below” (social history) into marketing historical scholarship. Second, it attempts to help marketing historians identify alternative sets of primary and secondary sources, e.g. oral history archives, which would allow them to be much more optimistic about their own ability to reconstruct the perspectives of those whose voices are all too often ignored. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer citizenship; History from below; Methodology; Narratives; Oral history; Prosumers",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945187695

The coaching interventions towards the top manager generally succeeded and supported substantial changes in the Company’s approach to safety. The safety manager solved 69 % of the coaching tasks. However, the safety manager did not change her role behavior substantially and this intervention was categorized as partly failed. In this case, the role behaviors of the coach and the safety manager and the power relation between these lead to implementation failure. Role behaviors of the coach and the participants are important for the implementation of individual coaching interventions. The theory of individual coaching needs to address these issues.

One source of confounding in non-randomized studies is the participants’ attitudes towards the intervention. Because randomized workplace interventions are not always feasible, it is important to investigate differences between study groups in readiness for change. To meet this aim, we used data from an intervention study of the effects of work-time control. The study design entailed both self-selection (i.e. non-random) and random allocation into intervention and control groups. Some team leaders rejected randomization because they considered it to be fairest to increase work-time control among employees in most need. Others accepted randomization arguing that it was fairer to allocate a potential benefi t by random. We found no difference in readiness for changes when comparing the self-selected intervention and control groups. In contrast, the randomized intervention group reported higher readiness for change when compared with both the randomized control group and the self-selected intervention group. This suggests that self-selection into intervention and control groups may refl ect the local leaders’ rather than the employees’ readiness for changes and that randomization may infl uence the participants’ attitude towards the intervention perhaps by evoking an experience of ‘winning or losing in the lottery’. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Bias; Confounding; Quasi-experimental; Readiness for change; Self-selection",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944595902

In the fashion industry, in order to achieve a sustainable supply chain management (SSCM), among other initiatives, companies have to consider the implementation of used apparel collection programs, in other words, reverse logistics (RL) practice. In this matter, the objective of this study is to identify the most important drivers for RL development and to investigate the level of importance of each selected driver for the Brazilian apparel industry sector. First, international peer-reviewed publications on RL were considered to identify the drivers that allowed the design of a questionnaire to facilitate data collection. Second, with a prior list of 15 drivers, an empirical research was conducted involving three Brazilian textile companies to validate these drivers. The final list included nine influential factors. Subsequently, a Brazilian RL expert was consulted to analyze them. Analytical hierarchy process (AHP) approach was used to obtain the RL driver priority ranking. The main contribution of this research includes the fact that the most influential drivers for RL practice are policy- and economic-related issues, for the apparel textile sector. Due to the lack of specific legislation, Brazil is still in a green awakening process concerning textile end of life product management. Limited gains of scale and technology restrictions are the major impediments for the economic feasibility of RL in the apparel industry sector. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944584712

The provision of direct mail is instead threatened by policy initiatives, notably: opt-out schemes, opt-in schemes, tax on direct mail, and data protection regulation. Regardless of which policy initiative we consider, its introduction has been primarily motivated by the cost of direct mail to society in terms of a negative environmental impact or unwanted nuisance to consumers. The positive value of direct mail to society has often been neglected. This paper makes a first attempt to analyze the socioeconomic value that direct mail bring to consumers and businesses. The results indicate that direct mail is likely to have a positive real value to businesses and consumers that should not be ignored when assessing and evaluating initiatives that will reduce direct mail volumes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944583988

However, team coaching also has some pitfalls which will be explored in this chapter. A 13 month team coaching intervention focusing on team safety-related competences, effectiveness, and learning was conducted in three department teams (team X, Y and Z) in a medium-sized Danish company (Company A). However, at the end of the intervention results between the three teams varied. Team Y solved 72 % of the coaching tasks and started an additional 15 %. Six out of seven success criteria for the intervention were fulfi lled and the last criteria partly fulfi lled. In team X, the equivalent results were 45 % safety tasks completed and 25 % started. Here, two success criteria were fulfi lled, four partly fulfi lled and one not fulfi lled. Due to organizational changes, team Z was excluded from the project half-way through the intervention. Lessons learned and possible solutions: Mutual goals among the team members are identifi ed as important for the success of team coaching. Moreover, organizational changes can interrupt the implementation of team coaching interventions. Clear communication and resolution of differences in opinion are essential for the process and results of team coaching and should be integrated into the theory of team coaching. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Coach; Communication; Intervention; Team coaching; Team commitment",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84944574647

Design/methodology/approach – Action research and action learning from a longitudinal study of ten SME managers in the wind turbine industry are applied to reveal SME managers’ learning and the impact of the application of learning in the wind turbine industry. Findings – The findings of this study show that SME managers employ a practice-shaped, holistic, cross-disciplinary approach to learning. This learning approach is supported by theory dissemination and collaboration on perceived business challenges. Open-mindedness to new learning by SME managers and to cross-disciplinary collaboration with SME managers by university facilitators/researchers is required. Research limitations/implications – The research is conducted within the wind turbine industry, in which intense demands for innovation are pursued. The findings require verification in other industry contexts. Practical implications – This research contributes strategies for SME managers to utilise research-based training and for universities regarding how to work with SME training. In addition, public bodies can enhance their understanding of SMEs for innovation and growth. The learning approach that is suitable for specialisation in larger organisations is not suitable in the SME context. Social implications – SME learning is enhanced by a social approach to integrating essential large-scale industry players and other SME managers to create extended action and value from learning. Originality/value – The findings reveal the need for extended theory development for and a markedly different approach to SME training from that used for training managers in larger companies.

This is in many respects a successful exercise, partly caused by the experienced HR-consultants working intensely with the many uncertainties felt by The China Management Team. The different obstacles mainly have to do with different approaches to work and management in two very diverse cultures, and culture is the main explanation for the first major setback of the process-the Chinese CEOs circumvention of the divisional managers, leading to his forced resignation.

Methodology/approach-The chapter is based on a single case study. We collected the data via 9.5 hours of interviews and also used the firm's annual reports. Findings-The case firm's internationalization was ""pushed"" by the Belarusian economic environment-especially, the fear of governmental takeover. The founders felt that internationalizing would be less risky than fully focusing on their domestic market. It was also ""pulled"" by growth opportunities on foreign markets and also a founder's personal contacts. The slowdown of the firm's internationalization was caused by the lack of foreign market knowledge and other resources. Practical implications-Despite of slowing the internationalization down and experiencing several fluctuations in foreign activities, the founders are satisfied with the firm's internationalization. Thus, managers should not automatically regard such internationalization a failure: adjustments in the firm's internationalization pace can be justified as it has to react to the changing economic and business environment. Originality/value-The chapter shows that a born global's internationalization can slow down, it can use its subsidiaries as bases for further gradual internationalization, and it can also experience fluctuations in internationalization.

Methodology/approach-Advancements in the study of global teams, leadership, process, and outcomes were organized into four themes: (1) openness toward linguistic and value diversity as enhancing team creativity and performance, (2) knowledge sharing in team-based organizations, (3) the significance of social capital for global team leader role success, and (4) shared leadership, satisfaction, and performance links in global virtual teams. Findings-We identify questions at three levels for bringing research on team-based organizing in global organizations forward. At the within-Team individual level, we discuss the criticality of process and leadership in teams. At the between-Teams group level, we draw attention to that global teams also need to focus on relationships and interactions with other teams within the same global firm, for example, when sharing knowledge. With respect to the across-Teams organizational level, we highlight how bringing people together in global teams from different organizational units and cultures creates the potential for experiential individual and team-based learning, while making the firm more flexible and adaptable. Theoretical implications-The potential of the relatively underexplored idea of global team-based firms as an alternative to hierarchy open up questions for empirical research, and further theorizing about the global firm. Practical implications-Practitioners can learn about organizational, team, and individual challenges and benefits of global team-based organizing. Originality/value-A century-old dominant organizational form is challenged when moving away from hierarchy-and hybrid-based forms of organizing toward team-based global organizing of work.

This paper analyzes the ways HR specialists and PSF managers/partners differ in their understanding of organizations and their management. The analysis supports the argument that, while HR specialists and the discipline of HRM are governed by bureaucratic logic in their approach to management, PSF managers by contrast are driven by professional logic. This creates a number of subtle as well as explicit tensions and disconnects that will have to be tackled if the practices of HRM are to prevail in PSFs. This paper contributes to HRM literature as well as institutional theory, by applying an analysis of institutional logics to HRM practice in PSFs. The paper builds on interviews with five HR managers who have held positions in PSFs, as well as a longitudinal case study of PSF managers in one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms.

Specifically, it is a puzzle whether business models determine strategies, or whether strategies precede business models (Seddon et al., 2004). Based on recent conceptual considerations (Cavalcante et al., 2011), the authors attempt to solve this puzzle by considering their mutual influence at different stages of the company's business lifecycle. For that, the auhors use Scandinavian Software Company (SSC) as a case study. The initial idea of a business model is shown to shape SSC's strategy in the birth phase. It is then argued that this relationship changed as SSC entered its growth phase and met competition, and the product market strategy determined the change in the business model.

Yet the question of whether places, such as cities, regions and nations, can be effectively managed using marketing techniques remains elusive, as place brands and company brands have been observed to differ in various ways. A key characteristic of this difference is the possibility of a company brand of being created from scratch and having its associations and characteristics carefully tailored to suit the needs of its authors. While the control of a company brand can easily be lost and its meaning relies on a reading of the brand by anyone receiving its message, the control that can be exerted over which meaning is attributed to a company brand appears almost absolute when compared to a place brand. A place is a brand often long before it is formally branded. A place brand – like a city, region or nation brand – is per definition attached to a system of geographical abstractions in quasi-cartographic form in which each city, region or nation is understood in relation and contrast to other geographical entities. For those who seek to alter perceptions about a place, this presents a challenge, since the role of a place in this system of geographical abstractions constitutes a piece of information more vital than any other in defining the place. Our understanding of places cannot be separated from their scale, and any effort at managing the reputation and meaning of a certain place will be interpreted in an unintended way due to interrelations between these abstract representations. For instance, a particular region is likely to be seen as part of a bigger context – for instance, the nation. Most of the time, the nation is in turn also part of a higherorder place (e.g. the European Union or Africa). Using the example of nation branding for Sudan and Slovenia, one can identify supranational places such as “sub-Saharan Africa” or “Eastern Europe”, carrying their own highly salient and.often negative meaning in much of the Western world. We explore how association to a system of place is thought to influence the prospects of branding campaigns and introduce and discuss how reassociation can serve as means of mitigation of negative supranational belongingness. In doing so, we discuss also the challenges of interregional branding in this regard, where perceptions of two (or more) different nations interfere. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Brand perception; Developing countries; Meta-brands; Nation branding; Perception management","Developing countries; Abstract representation; Branding campaign; Key characteristics; Marketing techniques; Meta-brands; Nation branding; Perception management; Sub-saharan africa; Abstracting",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943798888

This approach offers readers a new understanding of design activities and related functions, properties and dispositions. Presenting a ‘design mindset’ that seeks to empower students, researchers, and practitioners alike, it features a strong focus on how designers create new concepts to be developed into products, and how they generate new business and satisfy human needs. Employing a multi-faceted perspective, the book supplies the reader with a comprehensive worldview of design in the form of a proposed model that will empower their activities as student, researcher or practitioner. We draw the reader into the core role of design conceptualisation for society, for the development of industry, for users and buyers of products, and for citizens in relation to public systems. The book also features original contributions related to exploration, conceptualisation and product synthesis. Exploring both the power and limitations of formal design process models, methods, and tools viewed in the light of human ingenuity and cognition, the book develops a unique design mindset that adds human understanding to the list of methods and tools essential to design.

Today regions are in strong competition for companies, tourists and most of all talent. In order to differentiate one region from another, regional developers, politicians and planners increasingly focus on establishing the region as a brand. This is by no means easy, since places are complex systems of geographical abstractions in which each place is understood in relation and contrast to other geographical entities. In doing so, regions not only differentiate, but also cooperate (within one country or between countries), building so-called Inter-Regional Brands with an even higher degree of complexity. Accordingly this volume, provides a theoretically well informed but practically oriented overview of this phenomenon - including numerous cases and best practices.

However, the emphasis has mostly been on the upstream activities of the innovation management process and specifically about how to obtain as well as to integrate new sources of innovation beyond the traditional and internal R&D function. Conversely, the downstream activities of the innovation process, specifically marketing and commercialization, have attracted little research. But the situation is changing now due to governments and companies that have realized that in order for an innovation to be successful, it is not enough to have good new ideas: it must foremost be adopted by the market. As a consequence, there is currently a shift in priorities and a renewed interest in the marketing of innovation and especially in the adoption of original products or services, because one important function of marketing is to contribute to the adoption of innovative solutions by potential customers.

Our findings generally support the existence of a relational psychological contract in our sample. Duty-of-care strategies based on both HRM systems and the sensitivities of HR personnel and line managers to the narcoterrorism context, in combination with both explicit and implicit security policies, tend to be the sources of the content of psychological contracts. We propose a psychological contract model based on HRM systems and security and control policy in a narcoterrorism context for the further study of firms' duty-of-care strategies.

When performing place branding, regions often not only differentiate themselves but also cooperate (within one country or between countries), thereby building socalled interregional brands with a high degree of complexity.

Therefore, we surveyed 71 spouses of self-initiated expatriates in Denmark regarding two relevant self-perceptions and how they were associated with their adjustment. Our findings showed that feeling different, in terms of perceived cultural distance to the host location, was not associated with neither general adjustment nor interaction adjustment of the respondents.

Though it is tied to a linear model of science and technology, in which both the process and outputs of scientific research are, through RI, imbued with responsibility, the actors involved and the fields in which they are assumed to operate are exceedingly general.

It is within this structural setup that a governance phenomenon has emerged as the form through which expectations between different normative orders are stabilized. In addition, governance institutions serve as the central channels through which transfers between such orders are made possible. They structure the transposition of condensed social components such as economic products and capital, political decisions, legal judgments, scientific knowledge, and religious acts of salvation from one order to another, thereby allowing coevolution to unfold. In this context, law and legal instruments gain a central role since legal formalization is the central element that enables successful transfers to take place. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,"Central channels; Co-evolution; Co-evolutionary; Legal instruments; Political decision; Scientific knowledge; Social components",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943416790

Third, the paper explores the institutional base of recent shifts in India’s foreign policy. Fourth, the focus shifts to the geo-political and security relationship between India and the EU and asks why no real engagement is taking place. Fifth, it provides an understanding of the strategic partnership and discusses whether a rising India needs a Europe in decline.

This is further developed by looking at place branding from a performative perspective that centres on co-creation through active consumer involvement in event activities. Place consumers are identified as both external markets i.e. international tourists, and internal markets i.e. local populations in that building community is seen as an end in itself as well as a means to the external marketability of a place. To shed further light on these matters, the tourism branding event ‘IMAGINATION—Discover the Danish Spirit’ is analysed and based on this combination of theoretical and empirical studies, it is concluded that place branding events have the potential to meet consumers’ needs for active involvement and co-creation. Moreover, entering into dialogue with event staff and possibly other guests as well as performing aspects of a place generate a sense of place for place consumers, which may be hard to achieve through monologue-based place branding communication. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943406349

The first challenge is that the regulation of a certain aspect often does not lead to the intended outcomes. Regulative measures can only perturb, disturb or irritate agroecosystems because they are self-organising and autopoietic systems. All regulation of autopoietic systems depends on self-regulation because it is the ability of the agroecosystem to observe the disturbance and its internal schema of logic that will define the reaction. The second challenge is that regulation of one aspect often leads to unforeseen and unwanted side effects regarding other aspects. These unintended effects call for more regulations to deal with them, leading to a paradoxical situation of an increasingly growing web of regulation and effects, a situation that is concretely reflected in the exponential growth rate of the amount of positive law on agriculture and environment. These challenges are amplified by the increasing complexity created by specialisations in science, law and farming practice, a complexity that cannot be dealt with by further specialisation. In this chapter, we argue, based on social systems theory, that there is a need for a second-order platform of agroecological regulation where different scientific and law perspectives can meet and communicate about sustainable development and regulation of agroecosystems. But it requires that each perspective acknowledges its own blind spots and acknowledges that the agroecosystem can be seen from many other perspectives. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.","Agri-food systems; Perspectivism; Polyocular framework; Secondorder science; Sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943384920

Therefore, we will define the brand and examine various options regarding what to measure in place branding. Finally, we will discuss the different approaches of brand measurement for their use in place branding, namely the approaches to measuring the brand in the form of free brand associations of target customers with qualitative methods; in the form of attributes with quantitative methods like standardized questionnaires; and with mixed methods that combine qualitative research with quantitative methods. Two mixed methods, namely the network analysis and the advanced brand concept map method, are explained in more detail.

Drawing from practical cases of project failure or success, we present a number of factors that commonly influence the introduction or improvement of wastewater use for potable and non-potable purposes. While water scarcity supports a discussion about reuse, decisive factors might be the level of direct exposure, availability of alternative water sources, education levels and perceptions of health risks, extent of public participation and buy-in, religious concerns, and the means and messages used in knowledge sharing and communication. Overall, acceptance of (safe) wastewater use varies with the development stage of the society, and can be a very dynamic process which makes social feasibility studies, close participation of target groups, and trust building essential components of successful reuse programs. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Gender; Perceptions; Potable water; Religion; Risk awareness; Wastewater acceptance","Computer software reusability; Health risks; Planning; Potable water; Public risks; Risk perception; Sensory perception; Water conservation; Alternative water sources; Cultural dimensions; Development stages; Feasibility studies; Gender; Public participation; Religion; Risk awareness; Wastewater reclamation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943338677

Electricity trading began through inter-regional bulk power transfer from the surplus region in eastern India to deficit regions in western India in 1999. This has led to the emergence of electricity traders, who have helped in optimizing generation asset across the country, and acted as counter-parties to trades and helped absorb the credit risk of distribution companies (DISCOMS), which were in poor financial health. Subsequently, as trade volume picked up, power exchanges with standard contracts were introduced in July 2008. Power exchanges are electronic platforms where anonymous price discovery happens based on supply and demand for power in the short term. The short-term electricity trade has reached 7.58 billion units (9.84% of total generation) in March 2012 with a market size of approximately US$ 4 billion. The short-term market includes power contracts of less than 1-year period, through traders or directly by the distribution utilities, “Day-Ahead” contracts through power exchanges and unscheduled interchange (UI) power trades. This has led to the development of an efficient trading market for electricity, capable of sending market signals for the development of the sector and selection of technology. It has helped increase capacity addition by the private sector. Considering the short-time span since the initiative to develop power market was taken, the achievements are significant. However, a variety of challenges include handling transmission corridor congestion efficiently, developing more products of longer duration and variety to meet diverse requirements of stakeholders, including contracts of 1 year and more to provide timely signals and estimates for required capacity additions, and viability of market players in medium and long term, considering continuing legacy of under-recovery of power cost from consumers.

We describe existing approaches and options to managing health risks in various wastewater uses. Traditionally, regulators have used water quality standards achieved through wastewater treatment for health protection. The chapter presents some of the treatment technologies, including membrane filtration, which is increasing popular and effective in removing pathogens and other pollutants. However, the high investment, operation and maintenance costs of these technologies limit their use in resource constrained settings. In these settings, the use of health-based targets achieved through placing multiple barriers along the food chain is recommended. In this approach, firms, farmers, and public agencies have flexibility to choose from a range of low-cost risk management options which in combination can achieve the health targets. Returns on Investment (ROI) of these interventions are high (US$ 4.9 per US$ invested), if incentive systems and institutional arrangements are in place to support the application and adoption of these risk management measures. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.","Disability-adjusted Life Years (DALYs); Multi-barrier approach; Pathogens; Wastewater and health; Water quality guidelines; Who","Costs; Filtration; Health; Membrane technology; Microfiltration; Pathogens; Public risks; Risk assessment; Risk management; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Disability adjusted life years; Institutional arrangement; Multi-barrier approach; Operation and maintenance; Risk management measures; Treatment technologies; Water quality guidelines; Water quality standard; Health risks",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943328438

Disasters and conflicts often result in injuries and permanent impairments, creating a new generation of persons with disabilities with diverse rehabilitation needs. Yet, disability issues have been under-reported and have received sparse attention in the discourse, research, practice and policies in disaster management. This chapter draws from a larger study that reviewed existing research, policy and practice documents of government and nongovernment organisations in Canada, India and the USA to understand the ways in which disability has been addressed or overlooked in crisis situations in the three countries. Focusing on India, this chapter investigates whether disability is included in policy, practice and training and education about disaster management. It attempts to identify gaps that need to be bridged to ensure disability-inclusive disaster management. Drawing from disability studies and the social model of disability, the chapter contests the dominant conceptualisation of people with disabilities in disaster management as a ‘vulnerable group’ or ‘special population’ with ‘special needs’. The social dimension of vulnerability in the form of disabling structural and environmental barriers and societal attitudes that people with disabilities face is emphasised. The study strongly recommends that disaster management in India can benefit from the participation of people with disabilities in all phases, given their expertise, skills and daily experiences in negotiating uncertain and difficult terrain. © Springer India 2015.","Disability; Disaster management; Disaster risk reduction; India; Vulnerability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943173766

Regions are increasingly bringing books and screen productions into play in order to position themselves on the global market. Pop-cultural phenomena like The Lord of the Rings, The Da Vinci Code and Dracula have remarkably stimulated tourism flows to specific destinations in New Zealand, Scotland and Romania and inspired a new generation of promotional campaigns based on fictive narratives (Buchmann 2010; Huebner 2011; Light 2007; Månsson 2011; Reijnders 2011). This study addresses the spatial consequences of mediatized tourism in Switzerland and demonstrates how pop-cultural representations in Indian cinema trigger new entrepreneurial initiatives and relationships transcending local trajectories. Based on illustrative cases of Alpine destinations pandering to Bollywood, the chapter explores how popular culture transforms place-making imageries and practices in established tourist destinations. © 2015 selection and editorial matter, Anne Lorentzen, Karin Topsø Larsen, Lise Schrøder.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941302749

Chinese firms often lack Research and Development (R&D) capabilities but are increasingly becoming preferred technological partners for transnational corporations. We investigate an STP between a Scandinavian and a Chinese firm and try to explore how to gain relational competitive advantage by focusing on its two essential stages: relational rent generation and appropriation.

While native children face yearly poverty risks of less than 10 percent in all three countries and for all years studied the increasing proportion of immigrant children with an origin in middle- and low-income countries have poverty risks that vary from 38 up to as much as 58 percent. At the end of the observation period, one third of the poor children in Norway and as high as about a half in Denmark and in Sweden are of immigrant origin. The strong overrepresentation of immigrant children from low- and middleincome countries when measured in yearly data is also found when applying a longer accounting period for poverty measurement. We find that child poverty rates are generally high shortly after arrival to the new country and typically decrease with years since immigration. Multivariate analysis shows that parents years since immigration and education affect risks of the number of periods in persistent poverty. While a native child is very unlikely to spend nine years in poverty, the corresponding risk for a child to a newly arrived immigrant was found to be far from negligible. Much of the pattern is similar across the three countries but there are also some notable differences.

We find that the effect of a self-employed father (mother) is much higher for males (females). These results are statistically and economically very significant, and they survive when we control for parental wealth and work experience from the parents’ firms and when we exclude cases where the offspring takes over the family business.

In the strategising actions, we found that even if the managers still dominate, some processes of direct involvement of employees occur, in particular when employees are asked to supplement overall strategic goals and when they directly shape several sub-strategies. Strategy practices found include strategy planning, an open space workshop and organised strategy projects. Especially, the latter two are important in facilitating the employee involvement. The case, however, also exhibits enterprise-situated praxises related to unplanned events, like the mitigation of taboos.

However, the automotive industry has long been cooperating with external partners and nowadays acquires about three quarters of the value created from their suppliers. Based on theoretical findings of other industries, we examine the role of technology transactions and external partnerships in fostering firm capabilities. Survey responses from the German automotive industry let us empirically test seven hypotheses with a multiple regression model. Based on a firm's individual resource configuration and capability level, results show that some firms clearly profit more from openness than others.

In the last decade, the notion of software ecosystems has been established as a new paradigm in software engineering. In its essence it proposes participative engineering across independent development organizations centered on a common technology. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art and presents a first step towards a typification of successful software ecosystems. We discuss key characteristic of the ecosystem types and present a set of example cases. The characterization reviews and consolidates existing research and discusses variations within the key building block of a software ecosystem. It further enables sharpening the borders of what an ecosystem is (and what not) and how the individual types can be differentiated. Thus, this paper contributes to widening the understanding of software ecosystems and serves to prepare a software ecosystem taxonomy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Ecosystem taxonomy; Ecosystem types; Software ecosystems; Software engineering","Ecology; Software engineering; Taxonomies; Building blockes; Key characteristics; Software ecosystems; Stand -alone; State of the art; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937400084

Design/methodology/approach – The authors review existing Chinese indigenous management research from an institutional theoretical perspective and provide a critique of the research from that perspective. Findings – Chinese contexts are more than Confucianism. Focusing on this aspect of culture without integrating other institutional contexts, while informative, is unlikely to identify and explain the uniqueness of Chinese individual and organizational behaviors. Informed by institutional theory, the authors examine how institutional language context influences Chinese institutional behavior. The authors also argue that the guanxi phenomenon is more strongly dependent on institutional forces than on culture in the recent Chinese history. Incorporating these “non-cultural” institutional contexts in research enables us to describe the “what” and explore the “why” and “how” in theory development, rather than placing value judgments on the institutional arrangements. Research limitations/implications – While societal culture provides an important institutional context, China’s broad culture is not unique among countries with similar Confucian traditions. Chinese management scholars are encouraged to be mindful of pervasive institutional contexts in exploring and theorizing local organizational phenomena. Research without considering non-cultural institutional contexts may prevent a finer-grained understanding of Chinese organizational phenomena for developing Chinese management theory, and it is unlikely to identify the uniqueness of Chinese organizational phenomena among countries influenced by similar Confucian cultural traditions. Originality/value – Built on previous literature, this paper is among the first to specify and examine explicitly non-Confucian Chinese institutional contexts as a basis for the exploration of Chinese organizational phenomena. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Chinese management research; Cultural context; Guanxi; Institutional context; Institutional language; Institutional theory",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932622777

It investigates the possibility of applying a fixed routing strategy instead of a daily routing optimisation strategy, analysing the benefits derived from the driver's familiarity with his/her surroundings, customers' habits and set-ups. The final aim is to provide an effective and flexible decision-making tool to identify the best routing strategy, considering the level of learning invested by each driver. It is assumed that learning effect impacts on the service time, i.e., on the time spent in service operations once arrived at the customer's site. Results demonstrate that fixed routes strategy can often be better than the daily optimised strategy and strongly depends on the parameters investigated in this work.

Having completed the implementation of an integrated HIS, the Faroese Health Service (FHS) has commenced discussions concerning getting value from their IT investment. In order to fulfill this objective an action research project was started in the fall of 2010 consisting of two cycles: (1) setting the stage for benefit realization and; (2) benefit realization in a pilot area. The first cycle has revealed that it is not possible to distinguish between working processes and HIS, that benefit realization in healthcare (a public organization) has a much broader perspective than just financial value and that the reaping of benefits is quite difficult. This paper reports on the first two action cycles. Framed by the theory of Style Composition in action research we suggest a method to identify and realize emergent IT public value in an HIS action research project.

It investigates how calculative practices such as accounting develop knowledge that functions as an engine (MacKenzie, 2006) for innovation. This is an attempt at exploring the role of accounting through its performative effects so that, rather than only describing the world, it also helps to change it. The thesis is that calculative practices are engines involved in luring actors into doing new things by their ability to inspire them to ask new questions and to see new opportunities. As engines, calculative practices trigger a process of mobilisation of knowledge and insight which become part of the innovation. This innovation, in turn, leaves traces that can develop new calculative practices. There is a dynamic relation between calculative practices and the innovation: the innovation drifts because calculative practices are engines helping to bring this drift along. In the case of Telepass, which is a technology that is designed both for managing motorists' behaviour and accumulating traces about such behaviour, the innovation was able to influence and recreate the engine anew. This story explains how the trajectory of innovation is a string of drifts mobilised by the performativity of calculative practices. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Accounting; Calculative practices; Drift; Engine; Incremental; Innovation; Performativity; Radical",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929430920

These processes are especially visible in anti-branding movements where reflexive consumers organize to reject, protest and campaign against particular brand values, often by using other brands to devise and enact counter-brand strategies. Drawing on research on consumer resistance we identify the critical reflexive consumer caught in a paradoxical tension between anti-branding and branding structures. An analysis applying the semiotic square is presented to reveal the underlying logical structure of brand and anti-brand meaning for two brands: Blackspot by Adbusters and the tobacco brand with no name from the Danish company Mac Baren. Our analysis shows how strategic brand management has successfully incorporated and responded to anti-brand structures, and suggests some reasons why conventional anti-brand campaigning might not be effective. Beneath explicit articulations and intentions anti-brand logic actually affirms the centrality of brands and commodities in consumer culture.","Anti-branding; consumer culture; consumer resistance; semiotic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84929093282

The literature review identified a gap concerning purchasing consortia with a social interest profile. The paper includes data from a coordinator that manages a purchasing consortium with social motives as well as from three member companies. Primary drivers for participating in the consortium are potential cost reductions, the social profile of the network, and the ability to improve other conditions in the buyer-supplier interaction. Barriers found are lack of trust, switching from current suppliers to consortium suppliers, variety in participants' requirements and lack of an attractive business case.

Drawing upon the specific peer model of critical incident stress management (CISM), in which qualified operational peers support colleagues who experienced critical incident stress, the paper discusses critical incident stress management in air traffic control. Our study revealed coping patterns that co-vary with the culture that the CISM programme fostered within this specific high reliability organisation. Seen as a social construct, CISM culture was found effective in the interaction of operational staff, supervisors and the CISM programme manager. We were able to demonstrate that social mechanisms of trust, interaction and communication are important factors in high reliability organisations. Indeed, we found that the CISM programme once integrated within the socio-cultural patterns of this specific working environment enhanced not only individual feelings of being supported but also organisational safety culture.

Our empirical evidence is based on responses from CEOs of 249 Danish manufacturing firms that are categorized into four groups, depending on their degree of international operations within the first three years. We demonstrate that the most internationally oriented firms seem to be the most market oriented in general. They are significantly more competitor-oriented than domestically oriented firms, but the results regarding customer orientation are more mixed.

Linear product development processes, including the traditional Stage-Gate process, cannot support the iterative cycles and external collaboration that characterize today's product development efforts. Hybrid processes combining elements of Agile and Stage-Gate models offer a more flexible alternative to conventional systems. A comparative case study of seven technology-intensive companies shows how combining Stage-Gate models, at the strategic level, with the Agile method Scrum, implemented at the execution level, can offer performance improvements and other advantages over even improved Stage-Gate processes. The key contribution of this study is a generic Agile/Stage-Gate hybrid process based on best practices as identified in the case companies.","Agile; New product development; Scrum; Stage-gate","Iterative methods; Agile; Conventional systems; Manufacturing companies; New product development; Product development performance; Product development process; Scrum; Stage gates; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927634573

Based on the ongoing discussion, this paper proposes an integrative view of a dynamic multi-stage new venture emergence. In particular, the findings of our research show how to match these approaches with the life cycle stages of an emerging venture. This paper contributes to existing entrepreneurship research by acknowledging the value of parallel sequential process combinations, by including customer demand as part of a market participant's selection criteria, and by recognising failure as valuable outcome. The implication for entrepreneurs is that, beyond discovering a potential venture idea, substantial development efforts are required to form a sustainable business model. For entrepreneurship research, our model is a first step towards an integrative discussion of new venture emergence aimed at fostering further research and the advancement of new theoretical insights.

LPS has been facing implementation challenges which result in a misused or limited LPS. To compare application with theory, daily application of LPS was monitored at three construction cases. In all cases it was registered that only parts of LPS were applied. When application was compared with theory it was found that some elements were misused. The four main schedules were all applied, but the interactions between the plans did not function. Moreover, the rules of the making-ready process were not observed, and were offered little concern. The result was a low-efficient scheduling tool. To overcome the implementation challenges of LPS the knowledge level first needs to be increased. Furthermore, there is a need for support in the entire organisation. More energy or stubbornness should be put into the implementation to anchor the changes deep into the organisation.

This paper defines dividend policies by three variables: 1) dividend payout ratio; 2) decision to pay dividend; 3) increase in dividend payout. The results show that firms with higher intellectual capital disclosures not only have high payout ratios, but also have a greater likelihood of increasing and paying dividends. Our findings are consistent with our hypothesis that lower information asymmetries of firms with high intellectual capital disclosure lead to more favourable dividend policies. In opposition to the expected hypotheses, the data does not indicate that intellectual capital disclosure and dividend policies affect firm performance or firm valuation.

But because complex systems are only near-decomposable, modular decompositions always contain interdependencies that cut across modules. Extant research suggests that these interdependencies may not be neglected, and that distributed problem solving must be coordinated across the modules. But is 'more' coordination in modular systems strictly preferable to 'less'? Analysis of a simulation model points to a trade-off: although constant coordination efforts are most effective in the short term, temporary coordination neglect-repeated switches between module-level autonomy and coordinating intervention-can yield superior long-run performance. The paper characterizes the conditions under which such temporary coordination neglect can be beneficial and suggests that the level of coordination in distributed problem solving serves to balance two functions: ensuring that the modules fit together and inducing broader search for better module-level solutions. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Agent-based simulation; Complex systems; Coordination; Modularity; Problem solving","Coordination reactions; Economic and social effects; Large scale systems; Product design; Product development; Agent based simulation; Complex product development; Coordination; Distributed problem solving; Long-run performance; Modular decomposition; Modularity; Simulation model; Problem solving",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84923776382

Sustainable innovation can be broadly defined as an innovation that has to consider environmental and social issues as well as the needs of future generations. Although sustainable innovation provides considerable new opportunities for companies it goes along with an increased complexity. This in turn requires certain organizational routines and capabilities to deal with the upcoming challenges. We explore what the specific driving forces are that increase the degree of sustainable innovation within a firm's innovation activities. We test them empirically for more than 1,100 firms in Germany and find that firms need to invest in internal absorptive capacities and to draw both broadly and deeply from external sources for innovation.

The basic claim is that such changes in attention in combination with the issue preferences of the incumbent government are crucial for understanding significant changes in the ministerial structure. In a broader perspective, the article attempts to bring the literature on agenda dynamics into the study of bureaucratic structure in order to better understand organizational changes in the top bureaucracy. © 2014 The Author 2014.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922586708

This attention to the industry results in many innovative technologies being integrated in these manufacturing arenas. In developing countries such as the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries, especially China who is a global leader in automotive sales and production, researchers see substantial attempts to increase economic and societal values in automotive sectors through the use of many sustainable strategies. Among these sustainable strategies, remanufacturing has witnessed much debate in recent years. In China, automotive parts remanufacturing is still in a nascent stage, but the country is striving hard to implement a strategy in industries to result in cleaner production. Additionally, remanufacturing yields high financial, societal, and environmental returns, and it provides advantages such as reducing costs (compared to virgin products), an increase in jobs, and the conservation of scare resources. Some earlier studies examined Chinese remanufacturing issues but they only focused on modeling concepts, without considering significant barriers. To bridge this gap, this paper analyzes internal barriers met by automotive parts remanufacturers and evaluates causal barriers by a proposed model framework. This objective is illustrated by employing the Grey Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) approach. By virtue of these findings, remanufacturers can eradicate major internal barriers and can increase the chances of practicing more productive remanufacturing in the Chinese automotive environments. This study extends the scope of this problem through varied applications of different techniques such as a fuzzy approach, matrix laboratory, and operations research tools by diversifying and including additional barriers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Weak signals, also conceptualised as trends, can be considered the most relevant input for developing foresight in an organisation. While detecting weak signals has traditionally relied on the news media, cultural products such as literature, movies, art, or computer games appear to have been neglected in the practice of foresight.However, literary genres such as novels can be a valuable source for developing foresight. Literature can be characterised as delivering ""thick descriptions"". Not only do novels describe social practices, but from them the reader also gains, for instance, deep insights into the feelings and emotions of the characters.These thick descriptions are even more interesting in the context of foresight when one considers that these descriptions play a role in the construction of social reality and therefore can influence, over time, reality, or rather translate fiction into fact. It can be argued that the new departs from cultural products, before translating into widely accepted social practices or mass-market products. The value of using literature in foresight also appears to be related to the notion that these narratives can be read as scenarios, revealing the potential of literature. Because of their narrative structure, these scenarios can overcome cognitive barriers in the development of foresight. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Cultural products; Foresight; Narratives; Trends","Computer games; Signal detection; Cultural products; Foresight; Market products; Narrative structures; Narratives; Social practices; Social reality; Trends; Translation (languages); conceptual framework; culture; organizational framework; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922232725

Although cloud services offer several advantages, they also make cloud consumers strongly dependent on providers. Hence, consumers have a vital interest to be immediately informed about any problems in their services. This paper aims at a first step toward a network-based approach to monitor cloud services. We focus on severe problems that affect most services, such as outages or extreme server overload, and propose a method to monitor these problems that relies solely on the traffic exchanged between users and cloud providers. Our proposal is entirely based on NetFlow/IPFIX data and, therefore, explicitly targets high-speed networks. By combining a methodology to reassemble and classify flow records with stochastic estimations, our proposal has the distinct characteristic of being applicable to both sampled and non-sampled data. We validate our proposal and show its applicability using data collected at both the University of Twente and an international backbone during the WikiLeaks Cablegate.

We envisage this process as a particular form of market innovation in which new product qualities are inscribed into market architectures. We focus on the market for clean technologies that emerged as a result of the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) directive that required polluting industries, including livestock farms, to implement the ""best available techniques"" in order to reduce their emissions. Our case study traces a Danish start-up firm's endeavors to commercialize one such ""best available technique:"" a solution for reducing ammonia emissions from farms. Building on the literature on the shaping of markets, we show that the construction of a market for clean technologies hinges upon the composition of a complex network of actors with divergent, and sometimes conflicting, interests, in which market devices (in this case, a technology list) play a pivotal role.

Design/methodology/approach – On the basis of two focus group sessions, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to a representative sample of 2,147 Norwegian households via e-mail. Findings – Results showed that the Norwegian public is concerned about fish welfare and is willing to pay a price premium for products made from welfare-assured fish. Norwegian consumers do not, however, want to be the only ones paying for fish welfare, as the main responsibility for fish welfare lies with producers and the Government. Research limitations/implications – In this study willingness to pay is measured using a hypothetical choice experiment. Values people express as citizens, however, may not accurately predict true consumer behaviour. This is generally referred to as “citizen-consumer duality” and may have affected the results. Practical implications – The study shows that there is a national market for welfare-assured fish products, but education initiatives focusing on fish farming and fish welfare issues would further influence the attitudes and purchasing habits of Norwegian consumers. Originality/value – Although concern about animal welfare is growing in the western world, very little attention has been given to the welfare of fish. This paper aims to make up for this by presenting a study of how Norwegians view the welfare of farmed salmon. © 2015 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Animal welfare; Attitudes; Fish; Fish farming; Willingness to pay","Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920973840

While the internationalization of AMNEs' RandD activities can largely be explained in terms of the twin strategies of competence exploitation and competence creation, EMNE RandD internationalization is rooted in the firms' overall catch up strategy to get on par with industry leaders.

It is applied in cost benefit analysis to enable the cross-comparison between different impacts and/or with other economic costs and benefits. For this reason, monetary valuation has a great potential to be applied also in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), especially in the weighting phase. However, several challenges limit its diffusion in the field, which resulted in only a few applications so far. The authors have performed a review of different monetary valuation methods for use in LCA. Firstly, monetary valuation approaches, methods, and LCA applications were identified. Secondly, key features and the strengths and weaknesses of each monetary valuation method were determined. Finally, monetary valuation methods and LCA applications were evaluated according to a comprehensive set of criteria, ranging from scientific foundation to uncertainty and complexity. It was found that observed- and revealed-preference methods and the abatement cost method have limited applicability in LCA, whereas the choice experiment method and the budget constraint method are the best options for monetary valuation in LCA. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Externality; Life cycle assessment; Monetary valuation; Weighting","Budget control; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economic costs and benefits; Externality; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Monetary valuations; Revealed preference; Scientific foundations; Uncertainty and complexity; Weighting; Life cycle",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84920032945

This article combines two perspectives on interest group representation to explain patterns of interest group access to different political arenas. From a resource exchange perspective, it argues that access to different political arenas is discrete as it is determined by the match between the supply and demands of interest groups and gatekeepers-politicians, bureaucrats, and reporters. From a partly competing perspective, it is argued that access is cumulative and converges around wealthy and professionalized groups. Based on a large-scale investigation of group presence in Danish political arenas, the analyses show a pattern of privileged pluralism. This describes a system where multiple political arenas provide opportunities for multiple interests but where unequally distributed resources produce cumulative effects (i.e., the same groups have high levels of arena access). © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919873562

In this study, we focus on corporate language-based communication avoidance (CLBCA) which has received little systematic attention in international business (IB) literature despite the negative impact it may have on MNC effectiveness. Applying a research methodology labeled multi-sited ethnography, we traced CLBCA across three Danish owned MNCs and identified five contextual factors that affect avoidance behavior in second language encounters: formality level, media leanness, group size, power difference, and relation strength. Thereby, this study provides novel insights into context dependent language barriers in MNCs. A central argument in this article is that communication avoidance in MNCs should not be perceived only as an individual level variable as has been the practice in most studies so far. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Communication avoidance; Corporate language; HQ-subsidiary relations; Language management; Multi-sited ethnography; Power; Qualitative method; Virtual media",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919668163

The objective for this paper is to investigate the visual saliency from two factors: 1) in-store signage and 2) placement of products. This is done by a triangulation method where we utilize data from an eye-track study and sales data from grocery stores. The first study takes place in laboratory settings with a simulated purchase situation, and the second research design builds on manipulated in-store settings and data from real purchases. We found optimal placement of two comparable goods (branded good and private label) to increase visual attention and sale for both goods. The use of signage increases visual attention and sale as well, yet only for the product that the label addressed, implying a cannibalization effect.

Strong institutions in the form of regulative, normative and cognitive structures can enable and inspire trust-relations among people at the interpersonal and inter-organizational level. We suggest, however, that the actor-dimension of institutional-based trust is an underexplored issue in the literature. Quoting Fligstein, institutional theory needs to explain how ‘some social actors are better at producing desired social outcomes than are others’ (Fligstein, 1997: 398). While Fligstein refers to actors who engage in ‘robust or local action’ we argue that actors who engage in (robust, local) sensemaking activities are better at (re)producing institutional-based trust. Particularly in situations when institutions are relatively unstable, unfamiliar to the actors and ambiguous, sensemaking strategies directed towards exploring the institutional foundations of trust at a local level can be an important basis of interpersonal trust-relations. First, based on a summary of studies of institutional-based trust we argue that an unresolved issue is how institutions more precisely form the basis for trust-relations. Second, we explore how sensemaking may serve as a bridge between institutional contexts and interpersonal trust processes. Based on Weber and Glynn’s (2006) model of relations between institutions and sensemaking, we argue that institutions are ‘emerging’ rather than ‘impacting’. The relevance of this view of sensemaking for bridging institutional-based and interpersonal trust processes is illustrated by reviewing a case study on how trust is created in a politically turbulent and foreign environment. © The Author(s) 2013.","institutional-based trust; institutions; interpersonal trust; sensemaking; trust",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84919460263

We also hypothesise, that these gendered networks are embedded in culture, in that women's networks are reduced within traditional culture, and that culture moderates the effects of networks on innovation. 68,984 entrepreneurs in 67 countries were surveyed by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, and analysed by hierarchical linear modelling. Entrepreneurs' gender is found to influence their networks, in that women network more in the private sphere, whereas men network more in the public sphere, but networks are smaller in traditional culture than in secular-rational culture.

We tap into this development and complement the existing discussion on combinative capabilities with a perspective that focuses on organizational characteristics that encourage experimentation. Specifically, we argue that characteristics such as slack resources, tolerance for failure, willingness to cannibalize and external openness are important organizational antecedents for knowledge absorption activities as they prevent inertia. Drawing on multi-informant survey data collected from SMEs in Denmark (n. = 169), we find empirical support for the impact of these characteristics (except for tolerance for failure) on various aspects of absorptive capacity (both potential and realized).

Counter to the findings using symmetric testing via multiple regression analysis in Prentice and Woodside (2013), the present study, using asymmetric testing via fsQCA, recognizes the occurrence of causal asymmetry, and draws conclusions from different algorithms leading to high scores for favorable and unfavorable outcome conditions.

Adopting a linear innovation model with the four sequential phases of concept ideation, product development, primary target market introduction, and subsequent secondary market introduction, this study expands the espoused definition of reverse innovation beyond its market-introduction focus with reversals in the flow of innovation in the ideation and product development phases. Recognizing that each phase can take place in different geographical locations, the paper then introduces a typology of global innovation with 16 different types of innovation flows between advanced and emerging countries, 10 of which are reverse innovation flows. The latter are further differentiated into weak and strong reverse innovation, depending on the number of innovation phases taking place in an emerging country. This analytical framework allows recasting of current research at the intersection between innovation and international business. Of the 10 reverse innovation flows, six are new and have not been covered in the literature to date. The study addresses questions of ethnocentrism and the continuity of the flow of innovation, and discusses possible extensions of the model with respect to the number of geographical categories and phases of innovation. Four research propositions highlight areas for future investigation, especially in the context of optimizing a firm's portfolio of global innovation competence and capability. The implications for management are concerned with internal and external resistance to reverse innovation. Most significantly, while greater recognition and power of innovation in formerly subordinate organizational units is inconvenient to some, the ability to leverage the potential of reverse innovation makes a firm more likely to succeed in global innovation overall. © 2014 Product Development & Management Association.",,"Commerce; Developing countries; External resistance; Geographical locations; International business; Market introduction; Organizational units; Product development phasis; Research propositions; Types of innovations; Product development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84914148791

It is argued that the contribution to this symposium represent a Public Values Perspective, distinct from other specific lines of research that also use public value as a core concept. Public administration is approached in terms of processes guided or restricted by public values and as public value creating: public management and public policy-making are both concerned with establishing, following and realizing public values. To study public values a broad perspective is needed. The article suggest a research agenda for this encompasing kind of public values research.

We use detailed register-based panel data and difference-in-differences estimators to benchmark common unobserved influences on financial investments. Women increase the fraction of wealth invested in stocks after marriage and decrease it after divorce, whereas men show the opposite behavior. Households whose joint labor income risk is reduced more by marriage have a higher increase in their exposure to risky assets in marriage. Thus income risk sharing in the household is important for financial risk taking and investment responses to marital transitions.

Parallel to this, there has been increasing focus on the nature of commitment, and in particular the existence of multiple commitment foci. In this paper, we examine how HR practices influence professionals' commitment to their organization, to their profession or to both organization and profession, in a qualitative study of three Danish financial investment firms. Our findings suggest that in professional service firms, HR practices encourage high levels of organizational commitment primarily and most often through their influence on professional commitment and that HR practices related to flexible work design are essential in creating balance between an employee's commitment to organization and commitment to their profession. Further, the findings suggest that these same HR practices may foster such high levels of professional commitment that labor turnover will increase when opportunities for pursuing professional goals afforded by work design are restricted. © 2014, © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","case study; high commitment management; high commitment work practices; professional commitment; professional service firms",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911985979

Specifically, the research provides a customer equity model in which the influences of both customer satisfaction and complaints are considered. The impact of the customer voice variables on hotel performance is investigated while considering the potential for moderating effects by hotel size and star rating. We use a more robust approach to measure firm performance than is traditionally used in satisfaction-performance studies.

However, the potential for this often remains unused, not least in tourism. This article argues that if tourism service encounters are changed into 'experience encounters' by integrating them into the tourism experience to which they are related, this will create added experiential value for tourists and increase the creation of knowledge about users. This is illustrated in an innovation field experiment in a retro design boutique hotel in which service encounters were developed into experience encounters. The experiment illustrates the potential that experience encounters have to create knowledge and value, but also suggests some barriers that need to be overcome. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Experience encounters; Experiment; Knowledge development; Service encounters; Value creation","innovation; knowledge; tourism management; tourist behavior; service sector; tourism development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907070372
